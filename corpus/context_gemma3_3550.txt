T-Rex: Utahraptor's started his own charity dedicated towards reanimating his body when he dies.
T-Rex: What a copycat!
T-Rex: It's MY idea, even if I did do it just by accident. Now it's like a bizarre arms race, seeing who can reanimate their dead body first. It's dumb. And yet, I'm totally going to win!
Utahraptor: This isn't a race, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It is, and you started it!
Utahraptor: Fine then - I'm ending it! I just thought it would be cool to have people working on reanimating our bodies when we die, but if it's such a big deal for you, forget it.
T-Rex: Awww! Really? You'd give up being a reanimated corpse for our friendship?
T-Rex: Because that's what my charity was looking into: reanimating long-dead corpses! We was gonna make zombies.
T-Rex (punchline): We - we was being straight out socially irresponsible.




T-Rex: If somehow - SOMEHOW - I die, then I would like to be cremated, please!
T-Rex: And then I would like my carbon remains to be crushed into diamonds, please!
T-Rex: And then I would like some of the remaining carbon to be made into pencils and the pencils be given to my pals for them to draw with, and then a year after I die I would like for there to be an art show of all the awesome T-Rex pencil pictures, please!
T-Rex: Also, I would like there to be explicit instructions for my pals not to chew on the pencils because that's kinda super gross, please!
Utahraptor: What do we use the diamonds for?
T-Rex: Um, a little thing called FASHION??
T-Rex: Or for an industrial drill bit. Whatever; THE POINT IS, whenever you look at it you can think, "My pal's body made that. Huh! I remember him now!"
Utahraptor: "I wonder how much cash I can get for it. Maybe I'll write down my guess with this pencil, also made from his body."
T-Rex: Nooooooooooo
T-Rex (punchline): -body will pay much for an artificial diamond but nice try




T-Rex: Ten years ago peeps were like, "hey I have a great idea: let's use computers to talk to our pals and call it 'social networking'!" And we were all like "hey, great idea, I've been looking for something to do with this computer anyway!"
T-Rex: Then SOMEONE shouted "also, let's count AND publicly reveal how many friends everyone has!"
T-Rex: So now we live in a world of QUANTIFIED FRIENDSHIP, Dromiceiomimus. A world of almost involuntary HARD NUMBERS added to what was previously just a vague impression. Did you know I'm less popular than the guy who invented the phrase "butt stuff"?
Dromiceiomimus: I mean, yeah, I would've assum--
T-Rex: BECAUSE I AM.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, it's just a number on a website.
T-Rex: It's a popularity contest! WORLDWIDE!!
Utahraptor: Dude, if you really think that, then maybe you need to "unplug" for a bit. Spend some time "IRL" with your "meatspace" friends.
T-Rex: Stop talking like that.
Utahraptor: You might rediscover some old "likes" - and maybe even some new "favs"!
Off panel: And hey, while you're "AFK", feel free to "AMA" about unplugging from your phone for a while! Sure, our "baud" may be a little slower, but we've got "kilobytes" of heart!
T-Rex: ARGH!
T-Rex (punchline): I know you know how to not talk like that!!




T-Rex: Guys, it's not hard to stay fully unknowable even to yourself. There's an easy way to go through life and still have mysteries. All you have to do is...
T-Rex: ...donate some friggin' sperm!
T-Rex: Find a program where they don't inform you when your sperm is used, and you're done! From now on, you'll NEVER KNOW if you've got a particular descendant - a child! - running around. People will say, "Hey, do you have any biological descendants?" and you'll be able to say "Man, WHO KNOWS??" Plus, you've done it all without the hassle of unplanned pregnancies!
Utahraptor: And this is appealing, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Oh yes! Entirely.
T-Rex: Wouldn't you love to be able to imagine every stranger of a certain age as your child? Utahraptor, it's a guaranteed sense of wonder for the rest of your life!
Utahraptor: That's kind of cool, actually.
T-Rex: I know! And it's all thanks to sperm!
God: T-REX DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU'VE OFFERED "DONATE SOME FRIGGIN' SPERM" AS A SOLUTION TO AN APPARENTLY INSOLUBLE PROBLEM
T-Rex: Sixteen times?
God: THAT IS
God: AMAZINGLY
God (punchline): PRECISELY CORRECT




T-Rex: There is a person who has been with us for generations. Centuries! MILLENNIA! He has a name, but we always refer to him by his title instead. And it's a title that not everyone gets to have!
Narrator: GUESS THE CHARACTER
T-Rex: You'll find him everywhere from 5th century Europe to modern-day London, and beyond! His travels take him through space and time, though he does spend an AWFUL amount of time on Earth. And if he gets too old, or injured, or the person in the role doesn't want the job anymore, a regeneration process begins after which we all get to see a new version of this guy with a new body and altered personality! One last hint: he's ALWAYS a man, and he travels in a UNIQUE VEHICLE.
Utahraptor: Aha! We're talking about Doctor Who!
T-Rex: No, I don't know that person. It's the Pope!!
T-Rex: You've heard of him, right? His regeneration process gets us a new Pope, and we're all, "ooh, what's THIS Pope like? Maybe he'll be a ginger this time!"
Utahraptor: Again, that is a Doctor Who thi-
T-Rex: AGAIN I'M SORRY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS. Seriously. Have you not heard of the Pope??
T-Rex: He usually travels with one or more companions who help him on his adventures!
Off panel: STOP SAYING THE POPE IS FROM DOCTOR WHO
Off panel: JUST
Off panel (punchline): JUST STOP MAKING ME REALLY WANT TO READ ABOUT THE POPE SO I CAN UNCOVER MORE OF THESE INCREDIBLE PARALLELS




T-Rex: "A handsome T-Rex has just found out he's spending his summer vacation on the run from the law -- and from the agents of the law that enforce it!"
T-Rex: Oh snap! Is it "Everyone Owes Me Five Excellent Movie Ideas Thursday" AGAIN??
Dromiceiomimus: "After falling into experimental chemicals, a lovely Dromiceiomimus discovers that she can see the future -- only the future isn't what it used to be! It's a musical and she must now accustom herself to the idea."
T-Rex: "A cursed mansion leads a band of teenagers - led by an older and handsome T-Rex - to confront their greatest fear: becoming separated from each other and dying alone in a cursed mansion."
T-Rex: "Explosions have been going off all over town, and the culprit has escaped justice."
Utahraptor: "SO FAR."
Utahraptor: "A handsome T-Rex investigates, but his pratfalls only interfere with the ongoing police investigation."
T-Rex: "Someone's poisoned the town's water, and the clock is ticking. Will a handsome T-Rex have time to solve... The Riddle of 'Man, Which One Of You Dicks Poisoned The Water Supply?'"
T-Rex: "A casual use of the word 'dick' has raised eyebrows across town. Now, one T-Rex (handsome) has to confront his destiny in an unrelated matter."
T-Rex: Guys!
T-Rex (punchline): ...I think that one might be the best yet!




T-Rex: People are always like, "Boo hoo hoo! I'm not motivated!" Well, not anymore! Not since I, T-Rex, have decided to become...
T-Rex: ... a motivational speaker!
T-Rex: It'll be fantastic, Dromiceiomimus! I will motivate through a combination of folk wisdom and "uncommon sense" advice couched in clever stock market analogies!
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds great?
T-Rex: Sounds MOTIVATIONAL!
Utahraptor: I don't think the world needs what you're offering, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Think positive, friend!
Utahraptor: No, really! I don't know anyone who's ever been motivated by an insincere catch phrase. I think you need to get back to basics, if you're serious about this!
T-Rex: Basics, eh? Hmm...
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Excuse me! Unmotivated people? I'm T-Rex, your motivational speaker!
T-Rex (punchline): So! Has anyone here ever tried setting goals, and then achieving those goals?




Devil: T-REX CAN YOU RATE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIC PEN-AND-PAPER RPGS
Devil: ALSO KNOWN AS RPGS
T-Rex: I don't know what they are, man! Let's talk about something else - like chicks!
Devil: CHICKS ARE NOT AS MULTIFACETED AS A TRUE PEN-AND-PAPER ROLE PLAYING GAME T-REX
Devil: IN WHICH ONE PERSON IS THE GAME MASTER AND TELLS EVERYONE ELSE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
Devil: FOR EXAMPLE
Devil: YOU HAVE KILLED AN ORC
Devil: TO WHICH THE PLAYERS REPLY
Devil: INDEED
T-Rex: RPGs sound like nerd games that nerds play! With - with nerds!
Utahraptor: That's pretty closed-minded, T-Rex!
Utahraptor: You shouldn't be so biased against them. They're really just collaborative storytelling with especially terrible PR and easily stereotyped players. But they're probably fun! I imagine!
T-Rex: Have you ever played one?
Utahraptor: Nope!
Devil: I INVITE YOU ALL TO PLAY RPGS WITH ME TONIGHT T-REX
T-Rex: I'm not going to Hell just to play RPGs!
Devil (punchline): I PROMISE ONLY FLAVOURED CHIPS AND HIGH ADVENTURE




T-Rex: I would never want to get pregnant. Having to worry about what I eat because there's a baby GROWING inside me? No thanks!
Narrator: "A MALE PERSPECTIVE"
Dromiceiomimus: There's nothing bad about that, T-Rex! It's a special experience and you could probably stand to eat better anyway!
T-Rex: The cravings would be a good excuse for eating all the damn bread, but still! Too much RESPONSIBILITY. I'm dangerously carefree!
Utahraptor: Why are we talking about this?
T-Rex: No reason, just - sharing!
Utahraptor: Well as none of us can get pregnant because, oh hey, we're not female mammals, it's not something I'd expect you to worry about! "I'd never want to be a dividing cell, because there'd be two of me and we'd be tiny." -T-Rex.
T-Rex: I don't recall saying that!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "I have smelly pants." -Utahraptor.
Off panel: "I love the taste of chocochops!" -T-Rex?
T-Rex (punchline): Man! They are moulded chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone. Am I now to apologize for BRILLIANCE?




T-Rex: Bah! Nostalgia!
T-Rex: What use does it serve?
T-Rex: All it does is make us want things that we can't have, and can't even work towards having. Forget it! It's WASTED TIME.
T-Rex: From now on, I will not spend time remembering the past, nor will I be sad when circumstances change! From now on, I am all about TOMORROW.
Utahraptor: Are you sure that's a good attitude, T-Rex? Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to fulfill it!
T-Rex: And those who cannot remember to attribute their quotations are condemned to commit academic offences!
Utahraptor: It's common knowledge who said it! Sheesh! GEORGE SANTAYANA.
Narrator: HELPFUL ONE-PANEL SUMMARY:
T-Rex: Nostalgia can make you sad!
Off panel (punchline): Attribute carefully!




T-Rex: "Things I could've done by now if I'd dedicated more time towards them", a list by me, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Ahem.
T-Rex: I could've started a family or three, either in series OR in parallel!
T-Rex: I could've travelled the world! I could've become good if not great at any number of instruments, painted beautiful things, entered the space program, learned new languages, advanced our knowledge of the universe, or embarked on ANY NUMBER of different careers!
T-Rex: Wow!
T-Rex: I honestly did not expect the list to be this depressing!
Utahraptor: But there's always gonna be more things you could've done than things you did! You're comparing many to one!
Utahraptor: That's not a fair comparison, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Holy crap, you're right! So what you're saying is... the sum of mes across the multiverse will always be more awesome than in one individual timeline??
Utahraptor: Right! You all add up to a pretty great guy.
Narrator: PARALLEL UNIVERSE DX-5326:
T-Rex: So what you're saying is... the other mes across the multiverse are DRAGGING DOWN THE FRIGGIN' AVERAGE?? Man! Sometimes I wonder why I even bothered inventing jetpacks so that we can hunt humans from jetpacks!
T-Rex (punchline): Also, the humans get jetpacks.




Narrator: T-REX AND DROMICEIOMIMUS PARTIED EXTREMELY HARD LAST NIGHT.
T-Rex: It was the best party ever in time!!
T-Rex: ...Well, in my experience, anyway!
T-Rex: Do you think it's possible that throughout ALL TIME there's been or will be a better party, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Well, it WAS a good party, but are we including all space as well as all time? We'd have to have partied harder than anyone, EVER, WHENEVER, throughout the entire universe at any point in any timeline. That's a tall order!
Dromiceiomimus and T-Rex: To be fair, though, it WAS a good party.
Utahraptor: So if you did have the best party in time, then all other parties are worse from here on out! THANKS, T-REX.
T-Rex: Dude!
T-Rex: Don't blame me for having the best party, THANK me that you didn't experience it, because now you won't be disappointed with all future parties! This heavy burden must be borne by me and Dromiceiomimus alone.
T-Rex: Okay.
T-Rex: This may be a bad time to say this but it was a super great party, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
T-Rex (punchline): Why are you leaving in mid conversation; many cultures consider that RUDE?




T-Rex: Centaurs! Everyone loves centaurs because they're a horse on the bottom half -
T-Rex: - and a dinosaur on the top half!
T-Rex: It's FLAWLESSLY AWESOME. A horse body combined with my upper torso? WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LIKE?
Dromiceiomimus: While centaurs are pretty awesome, I think mermaids are better: fish bottoms, ferocious dinosaur tops!
T-Rex: Aw geez, I forgot how amazing mermaids are!!
Utahraptor: I like the minotaur: head of a bull, body of a dinosaur!
T-Rex: No doubt, it's a rad beast!
T-Rex: You ever wonder if these amazing creatures will get messed up by future generations? Like, instead of having awesome dinosaur parts, they'd replace them with something much wimpier and softer, like I dunno, mammals or protoprimates?
Utahraptor: So terrible! The very idea makes me want to drop a barf.
Off panel: Oh no! I'm dropping a barf right now because I imagined it too hard!
T-Rex: Don't vom on the carpets!
Off panel: blegh
Off panel (punchline): Oh no, the vom is coming out




T-Rex: GAMERS: are you the best at games?
T-Rex: You probably think you're PRET-TY good at games, huh?
T-Rex: Yeah you do. I bet you think you're #1 at killing bad guys on a computer screen. Me? I like harder challenges here in the real world - or as I call it, "hardcore mode" - where if you die in the game you die in REAL LIFE. Oh, but I'm sure that sort of thing wouldn't interest you. Too much of a challenge, right?
T-Rex: Hey, how many imaginary aliens did you imaginarily shoot today?
Utahraptor: Shut up! I'll kick your ass!
T-Rex: Oh yeah? PROVE IT. Let's play Mop The Floors!
T-Rex: My best time? 15 MINUTES. I "zerg rush" dirt and grime so fast that you'll never beat my time, N00B.
Utahraptor: What? Your usage of gaming language gives authenticity to your claims and speaks to me in terms I relate to!! I WILL DESTROY YOU BY MOPPING THE FLOORS REALLY WELL.
Narrator: THIS CONCLUDES "COMICS FOR PARENTS TO GIVE TO TEENS". PARENTS: BE SURE TO CUT OFF THIS LAST PANEL
Narrator: SERIOUSLY. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, PARENTS
Narrator: YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED THIS COMIC. WHY AM I DOING YOUR PARENTING FOR YOU??
Narrator (punchline): I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU




T-Rex: Let's say I've got a bunch of things, and they can be sorted into categories, and I grab one completely at random.
T-Rex: Odds are it's gonna come from whatever category has the most things in it!!
T-Rex: Which makes sense, right? If I have 1000 completely average sandwiches and 5 rock-my-face-like-it-has-NEVER-been-rocked sandwiches, and I grab one at random, odds are I'm on an economy-class trip to Average Sandwich City.
Dromiceiomimus: I appreciate how you said "economy class" instead of "first class", thereby underlining how average these sandos are.
T-Rex: THANK you!
Utahraptor: I've heard of this! This is called "the principle of mediocrity"!
T-Rex: Sure is!!
Utahraptor: And with it you can argue that there's NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT EARTH. Odds are we're just a mediocre planet with mediocre life!
T-Rex: But the flip side is we're probably not alone, and other planets are full of equally mediocre life too!
T-Rex and off panel: HOORAY FOR A MEDIOCRE UNIVERSE!!
Off panel: Full of mediocre pals who might hang out with us until one of those cool species makes contact, and then they drop us and ghost
T-Rex (punchline): Wooooo




T-Rex: Does "Betty put butter on the bread" mean the same thing as "Betty buttered the bread"?
T-Rex: I would argue: no!
T-Rex: In the second example, there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered, while in the first, this is not necessarily the case! And this applies not just to butter: there are many other examples. For instance, “Gary wrote for many TV shows” leaves open the possibility of a co-author on the scripts, a possibility that “Gary wrote many TV shows” does not!
Utahraptor: Wow! These small changes in semantics (the meaning of a word or phrase) are quite interesting!
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: But hard, too.
T-Rex: Agreed.
Narrator (punchline): Thanks to chapter three of Steven Pinker’s 1989 book "Learnability and Cognition", upon which most of this comic was based.




T-Rex: A medical doctor is a pretty prestigious job to have! The catch is, it takes years of work to become a doctor. Like, literal YEARS.
T-Rex: I do not have time for literal years!
T-Rex: On the flipside, digging a ditch is pretty easy, but nobody's THAT impressed when you tell them you can dig a long hole. But I think it's naïve to assume that the amount of time it takes to learn a job is equivalent to the prestige it brings!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe there's jobs that have more prestige than others that still take the same amount of time to learn?
T-Rex: EXACTLY.
Utahraptor: And maybe you could learn these jobs to create the world's most impressive résumé?
T-Rex: Exactly!!
T-Rex: By focusing only on the callings that have maximum impressiveness per second, I can build a Totally Sweet Résumé in the MATHEMATICALLY MINIMUM amount of time.
Utahraptor: I don't know where you'll get the data you need.
T-Rex: Hmm, I don't know, maybe... THE INTERNET??
Narrator: LATER: T-REX FAILS TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS ON HIS RÉSUMÉ PROJECT
T-Rex: The internet didn't help me at all! It distracted me with pictures of cats with opinions!
T-Rex: N-
T-Rex (punchline): No regrets I guess




T-Rex: I had the weirdest dream last night. Again! Two nights of memorable dreams in a row: A NEW PERSONAL BEST.
T-Rex: I dreamt I was a cockfighter!
T-Rex: Only, I wasn't a regular cockfighter, who battles his animals against those of an opponent. It was with turkeys instead of chickens, and rather than fighting each other, I raced my own turkey around the countryside. Halfway through the race we started fighting - I would punch and the turkey would hop up and peck me. I remember holding back my punches a bit because I didn't want to be known as the kind of dude who would punch out a turkey.
Narrator: LATER: RUMOURS SPREAD.
Utahraptor: Hey! You punch out turkeys?
T-Rex: No!
T-Rex: That was in a dream. A DREAM. I never actually punched out a turkey.
Utahraptor: I heard that parents should lock up their turkeys, because you'll punch them out!
T-Rex: No!! I promise to never punch out a turkey.
Narrator: YEARS LATER: PROMISES ARE BROKEN.
Off panel: Hey, how come my turkey is unconscious?
T-Rex: Good heavens! I HAVE NO IDEA.
T-Rex (punchline): What??




T-Rex: Hallowe'en is coming up!
T-Rex: Which means, of course, that I had better get started working on my costume!
T-Rex: 2 years ago I went as a ninja! That was awesome, because I got to hit people with my ninja stick!
T-Rex: Last year I was a bear!
T-Rex: That was not so awesome.
Utahraptor: Working on costume ideas, I see!
Utahraptor: Well good luck! This year my costume is going to kick your costume's butt!
T-Rex: Oh yeah? What are you dressing up as?
Utahraptor: I haven't decided yet! I might go for a CONCEPT.
Off panel: I might go as "PLATONIC LOVE".
T-Rex (punchline): Good luck representing that in a way that guys don't find inherently confusing!




T-Rex: Last night I dreamed I came home and there was a spy there! He was trying to steal my DOCUMENTS!
T-Rex: So we got into a fight!
T-Rex: Only this spy didn't realize that I'M really good at fighting in dreams, so I pinned him to the roof with one hand and called 911, and the dispatcher was like "we only respond to EMERGENCIES, T-Rex - and you've got this handled!" I thanked them politely and hung up and said "Did you hear that? I think they're only gonna come if YOU call." Then I crushed the phone with my other hand and said "Wow. You're having a really difficult day."
Utahraptor: Huh. I never thought of this before, but dreams are really fan fiction your mind writes itself, aren't they?
T-Rex: Nope!
Utahraptor: Yeah man! And YOUR brain writes these little stories where you're the greatest guy ever, and then shares its author-insertion Mary Sue fics with itself, and THEN, congratulates itself on such an enjoyable, compelling narrative!
T-Rex: LISTEN. YOU'RE MAKING ME SOUND SUPER PATHETIC.
T-Rex: WHEN I REPLAY THIS CONVERSATION IN MY DREAMS, INSTEAD OF "PATHETIC" I'M GOING TO SAY "SUPER AWESOME. AND I'M SORRY, I KNOW YOU WANT TO DATE ME BUT REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE ELSE WANTS TO DATE ME TOO. IT'S MY BURDEN TO BEAR AND I SHOULDER IT GLADLY."
T-Rex (punchline): THEN I'M GONNA FLEX, JUST YOU WAIT




T-Rex: Attention, everyone who lives in North America! I come to you with some STUNNING NEWS.
T-Rex: Did you know that Europe is, like, REALLY OLD??
Narrator: FAQs ABOUT EUROPE
Dromiceiomimus: Q: Can you eat in restaurants that have been serving food since before YOUR country was even a thing??
T-Rex: A: Yes!
Dromiceiomimus: Q: Are there cities whose origins are lost, which is a non-dramatic way of asking if there are cities which PREDATE HISTORY HERSELF??
T-Rex: A: Yes! Old stuff is FRIGGIN' EVERYWHERE!
Utahraptor: Q: If I dig a hole in Europe, am I likely to find... a spooky skeleton?
T-Rex: A: Unfortunately, yes.
T-Rex: You will ABSOLUTELY find a skeleton. This is the downside of Europe: all those skellies have to go somewhere, and the dead vastly outnumber the living. Have you ever seen those models of Earth where the atmosphere is just this super thin layer on top of the hulking mass of the planet?
Utahraptor: Europe is like that, but with skeletons?
T-Rex: Europe is like that, but with skeletons.
Narrator: THIS COMIC BROUGHT TO YOU BY TOURISM EUROPE
Narrator (punchline): "WE ALSO INVENTED VAMPIRES"




T-Rex: Today I made peace with the possibility that I might never get wrapped up in a madcap case of mistaken identity.
T-Rex: I also made peace with the possibility that I might never have kids!
T-Rex: Then I made peace with the possibility that even if I HAD kids, they could grow up to be superduds. Then, I went on to make peace with the possibility that there might be someone out there who doesn't like Batman, and literally NOTHING can change their mind!
Dromiceiomimus: Today I made peace with the possibility that some people might enjoy being wrong.
T-Rex: Totally what I just said!!
Utahraptor: Today I made peace with the possibility that -
T-Rex: Yes?
Utahraptor: Well, today I made peace with the possibility that if I die tomorrow, people might not say "Such a tragedy; he had so much potential."
T-Rex: Ouch. Utahraptor, I promise I'll say it even if you die with tons of fully realized potential!
Utahraptor: Hey, thanks!
Narrator: THE NEXT DAY:
T-Rex: Today I made peace with the possibility that MY cause of death might not be listed as "kung fu".
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): Frig, wait! No I didn't!!




Narrator: COMICS FOR ASEXUAL CHICKS AND DUDES!
Narrator: today's comic
Narrator: UM, HOW TO STOP PEOPLE FROM WANTING TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU
T-Rex: I suggest telling them that you're asexual!
T-Rex: PROBLEM: SOLVED.
T-Rex: The end!
Utahraptor: That uh, that might not be the most helpful advice T-Rex!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: Well, if they're still in the Asexuality Closet, you're saying they should come out, which probably also means explaining to a confused AND amorous person what asexuality is! I can see wanting to avoid that.
T-Rex: FINE. Asexual people: you should do what I do when I want someone not to like me anymore!
Narrator: WHAT T-REX DOES WHEN HE WANTS SOMEONE NOT TO LIKE HIM ANYMORE:
T-Rex (punchline): [small] I sit in a boat until they go away




God: T-REX WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD
T-Rex: Oh gosh, no question: bone marrow. Prepared right? It's AMAZING. It's so good. It's SO good that I feel like it must be costing me something.
T-Rex: And that's why I love bone marrow!
God: HUH
God: INTERESTING
T-Rex: What? What's interesting about my answer, God? It's my favourite food!
Utahraptor: Perhaps it's just your favourite food you've HAD, and there's food in another culture you'd like more!
T-Rex: Hmm.
Utahraptor: Or heck, perhaps your TRUE favourite food would be an animal that went extinct 500 million years ago, or one that won't evolve for another 500 million years! Perhaps we're all wallowing in a global minimum for tasty animals but don't realize it, and will NEVER realize it!!
God: THAT UTAHRAPTOR MAKES SOME GOOD POINTS AND I'M REALLY GLAD I INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED HIM
T-Rex: What?! You can't take the credit for INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE, God!!
God: HMM
God (punchline): SEEMS THIS T-REX I DESIGNED IS MUCH TOO SASSY




T-Rex: You know what's freaky? Ghost ships! Ships sent sailing and found drifting weeks or months or years later, and EVERYBODY'S GONE.
T-Rex: Totally spooky, dudes!
T-Rex: I think what I love best about them is their aloneness: how everyone aboard was basically removing themselves from larger society, expecting to be reintegrated when they arrived - and then something went catastrophically wrong! All we can do is piece things together. Botched mutiny? Rogue wave? Everyone accidentally turning invisible AND mute AND ALSO incorporeal? If you are overly credulous then it is impossible to say for sure!!
Utahraptor: They do have a certain romance to them that modern transport technology lacks, eh?
T-Rex: It's the sea!
T-Rex: A boat can float along for years without crew or sails or a working engine. But if everyone disappears on an airplane it's not like we'll find it still flying around years later!
Utahraptor: Imagine if we did, though?
T-Rex: FINE
[T-Rex's daydream]
Off panel: Reports indicate the "ghost plane" drifted for years over Europe before being found. The plane was undamaged, but in-flight meals were only partially eaten, as if abandoned in haste.
T-Rex (punchline): Um, even in the heady realm of fantasy I don't see how this could happen!!




T-Rex: Okay okay - so there's been a lot of people born, right? In the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born. So the question is, are there enough people that I could write a story...
T-Rex: ...and reasonably expect it to have already been LIVED OUT in real life?
T-Rex: Let's assume narratives can be reduced to yes/no decisions, and on average real people make a yes/no decision every 15 seconds. Two people are needed to cover each option for every decision! So after - um, 33 decisions, we've got more people needed than are alive right now, and we're only eight minutes into our story. It is a stories-in-real-life disaster!
T-Rex: BUT, if I wrote a story about the first eight minutes of a baby's life, ODDS ARE someone has lived it!
Utahraptor: Not really!
Utahraptor: You're assuming that for each decision, every person takes a separate route, but the vast majority of babies are doing the same thing: crying and then being confused.
T-Rex: I guess the odds of my writing a story and having it be what ACTUALLY HAPPENED to some dude are pretty low, huh.
God: SEE THIS IS WHAT I TOLD YOU T-REX JUST BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS SUPERMAN AND "JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET"
T-Rex (punchline): [small] i thought maybe it could be me




T-Rex: What are flashbacks? Geez, it's like you weren't listening when I explained several weeks ago:
Narrator: SEVERAL WEEKS AGO:
T-Rex: Flashbacks are when you jump back earlier in a story!
Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique
Narrator: FLASHBACK
Utahraptor: So "Back to the Future" contains a large flashback when they travel back in time?
T-Rex: Actually, no!
T-Rex: If you use a time machine, it DOESN'T count as a flashback. This makes flashbacks one of the few literary techniques that's nullified by time travel. Ironically, it's also one of the few literary techniques whose name alone would be an AMAZING title for a time travel story. "Flash forward" is the other one.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: See, this doesn't count either, because "meanwhile" implies a parallel universe, or at the very least a conception of time in which all events happen simultaneously.
T-Rex: Flashbacks!!
T-Rex (punchline): THEY'RE HARD




T-Rex: I would like to date someone! Someone female! And also someone... perfect??
Narrator: THE PERFECT WOMAN
T-Rex: Okay so she's got sexy hot bones and kickin' lungs, OBVIOUSLY. But she's also got skills!
Dromiceiomimus: What sort of skills?
T-Rex: Oh, gosh, so many! She's great at science, makeouts, hijinks, heists... the works! You know, all the basics they teach you in Perfect Woman Finishing School.
Utahraptor: So, what does she do?
T-Rex: Whatever she wants! She's good at everything!
T-Rex: It's almost like she's got - godlike powers? Because she does! No, better: she IS a god, an elder god, and she dwells in space and she's a sinuous inky darkness, NO: a creeping madness! And when she extrudes into our dimension she devours -
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you seem to have... lost the plot?
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR, I am exploring my own sexual interests here, so um thanks for understanding?? Anyway now she's a polypous creature in a crown of weeping faces, gnashing teeth surrounding a single titanic eye at her core, all dressed in a barely-there red bikini.
T-Rex (punchline): SO HOTT




T-Rex: My new book is a collection of fairy tales.
T-Rex: A collection of SCIENCE FICTION fairy tales, that is!!
T-Rex: For example, Cinderella is exactly as it was before, only now Prince Charming has access to an advanced computer SO AMAZING that parts of it can exist only in hyperspace!
Dromiceiomimus: And he uses it to find his true love?
T-Rex: What? No, he doesn't know how to use it. I told you, the plot is exactly as it was before. This awesome stuff is all in the background!
T-Rex: And in Little Red Riding Hood, there's robot suits!
Utahraptor: Used to fight the wolf?
T-Rex: How old is Little Red Riding Hood, like, four? Six? She wouldn't know how to operate one. Besides, their interiors are scaled for adults. No, she proceeds as she normally does.
Utahraptor: These sound really bad.
T-Rex: Hello? Bad is the new totally totally sweet!
T-Rex: I call my tales, "Stories To Make You Say 'Why Don't These Characters Just Use A Phaser, Man, There's Clearly A Phaser In The Background There'"
T-Rex (punchline): The subtitle is "Look At It, I Think It's The Kind From Star Trek"!




T-Rex: Okay, I may have been a little hard on plants. I concede that, yes, there ARE some plants that actually do some cool things.
Narrator: AN APOLOGY TO PLANTS
T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: there's some dogwood plants that have tiny flowers which bloom, explosively, in something like half a millisecond! In doing so, they accelerate their pollen at rocket speeds and blast it out at over four meters per second. That's some fast pollen! And I am not a dude who's gonna say that naturally weaponized flowers aren't cool.
T-Rex: And, I SUPPOSE, plants that cure diseases are pretty alright too.
Utahraptor: A retraction!
T-Rex: Well - I realized that I do want plants on my side, even if most of them just sit there. And I do think it's kinda neat how some can turn dirt into strawberries. I've got nothing against strawberries!
Utahraptor: You love strawberries.
T-Rex: I do love strawberries.
God: HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE STRAWBERRIES T-REX
T-Rex: I don't know. A lot? They're alright.
T-Rex (punchline): To - to fully understand my love of strawberries is to fully understand the unblinking eye of madness?




T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for inventing a new personal catch phrase!
T-Rex: Get ready to hear the following AN AWFUL LOT, cats and kittens...
T-Rex: "Let's broaden our database and interface!"
Dromiceiomimus: That's your catch phrase? "Let's broaden our database and interface"?
T-Rex: Hah! Don't wear it out, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: What does it even mean?
T-Rex: I think that's PRETTY self-explanatory, vis-à-vis the broadening of databases and interface.
Utahraptor: I think this is the worst catch phrase I've ever heard!
T-Rex: Well you know what I say to that?
T-Rex: Let's broaden our
Utahraptor: Don't.
T-Rex: database and
Utahraptor: Please!
T-Rex: inter...
Utahraptor: NO. SAY IT AND OUR FRIENDSHIP IS ANNULLED
T-Rex: [thinks] face!
Off panel: YES HELLO
Off panel (punchline): THE GRAFFITI YOU DREW BEHIND YOU SO IT'D LOOK LIKE EVERYONE COULD READ YOUR THOUGHTS WHEN VIEWED FROM THE CORRECT ANGLE IS AS ANNOYING AS IT IS IMPRESSIVE




T-Rex: Maaaan, you know what's sucky and dumb? Our regular, unenhanced bodies. But you know what'd be awesome though?
T-Rex: CYBERNETICALLY ENHANCED BODIES.
T-Rex: All we need to do is figure out how to get living tissue to talk to cold heartless metal and we are SET. Giant metal arms, here I come!
Dromiceiomimus: Pfft, limbs are entry-level stuff. What we need are implants that enhance our BRAINS: deeper, more complex thought on any issue? That could change the WORLD, yo. Get that installed in everyone and BAM, we are SET. The problem is brain implants are a tough sell!
Utahraptor: I'm sure eventually we'd come up with something that rewired our brains without surgery!
T-Rex: YES.
Utahraptor: And this tech would, say, let us conceive of more complicated ideas and concepts than we ever could've done before the upgrade?
T-Rex: YES. Oh god, yes. We'd PITY those who hadn't been upgraded yet!
Utahraptor: Then good news, T-Rex! You're already a cyborg: that tech's called LANGUAGE.
Narrator: SURPRISE! YOU'RE A CYBORG TOO, AND YOUR PARENTS UPGRADED THE WETWARE OF YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU WERE A BABY, WITHOUT YOUR EXPLICIT CONSENT!
Narrator (punchline): "YOU'RE WELCOME"




T-Rex: Last night I built myself a machine...
T-Rex: ... a time machine!
T-Rex: This time machine is a watch, one that allows me to travel through time at the fantastic rate of one second per second!
T-Rex: It will show me what tomorrow is like, tomorrow!
T-Rex: (What a great adventure!)
Utahraptor: That sounds like a pretty useless time machine!
T-Rex: Hey!
Utahraptor: Besides, everybody knows that the smart way to build a time machine is to spend your life building it, but then have your future self send it back in time to you right now, thereby saving you the effort! You've been wasting your time!
T-Rex: What?
Narrator: SUDDENLY, THIS COMIC'S PUNCHLINE, AND THAT OF THE SYNDICATED COMIC STRIP "CATHY", ARE SWITCHED!
T-Rex (punchline): Ack!




Narrator: HOW TO WRITE A SCENE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE DARK
T-Rex: Sometimes the lights go out in a story, and you may be confused as to what your characters are doing!
T-Rex: "What was that crash noise? Is someone moving around??" - YOU
T-Rex: "Oh no, is my tall character's head impacting against a low-hanging beam? Has my short character wandered into an open cupboard and is now stumbling, forever lost amongst the pots and pans??" - YOU, AGAIN
Utahraptor: Do you ever wonder if we experience the world in fundamentally different ways?
T-Rex: CONSTANTLY.
T-Rex: Anyway, the solution's real easy. When you introduce a character just say something like "Mary hadn't worked her ass off for twenty years to be Chili's ASSISTANT manager. She was shrewd, she was calculating, and right now, she was angry. Also, she had a flashlight on her at all times."
T-Rex: Done!
Narrator: THE END
Narrator (punchline): IF ANYONE TELLS YOU WRITING IS HARD THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT FEWER WRITERS TO COMPETE WITH




Narrator: DOG FACTS
T-Rex: There are many facts about dogs! Here are but a few of them.
T-Rex: FACT: Dogs are alive. Some of them, anyway!!
[The panel image is blurred and color-shifted, to represent how a dog might see it.]
T-Rex: FACT: Dogs are good at smelling but not so good at seeing. They can't even see the colour red!
Dromiceiomimus: But red is like the #1 easiest colour to see!
T-Rex: I KNOW!! But dogs are all "geez my body isn't built to see this dang colour, geez, I bet I could smell it though".
Utahraptor: Could we engineer dogs that smell colours?
T-Rex: Maybe! It's like, what do we really know about dogs??
T-Rex: They'd need to smell light, which seems CRAZY. But not impossible? Senses are just different ways we experience data, and you could convert light to smells, right?
Utahraptor: But isn't colour a quale: a private, ineffable, subjective experience that can never truly be shared? Do dogs have qualia??
Narrator: DOGS
Narrator: • I DUNNO MAN
Narrator: • THEY RAISE SOME DEEP QUESTIONS
Narrator (punchline): • I DUNNO




T-Rex: Cargo cults are religions that have developed during World War II in island tribal societies exposed to the West! Islanders saw planes delivering amazing and valuable cargo to the troops, and believed it to be divine.
Narrator: KARGO KULT KOMICS
T-Rex: During the war, the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them - that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals. And of course, after the war ended and the troops left, the cargo stopped being dropped too.
Utahraptor: So what happened then?
T-Rex: The islanders started mimicking what they'd seen the troops doing!
T-Rex: The result was ersatz marches, imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo, and even torch signal flares, used to signal divine planes that never come!
Utahraptor: Wow! It recasts Western military culture and tools as religious practice and iconography, respectively!
T-Rex: I know! It's CRAZY! Not in the pejorative sense, but in the more esoteric "Holy crap the Prime Directive on Star Trek was RIGHT" sense of crazy. It's a very particular sense of crazy but I'm feeling it right now!
Off panel (punchline): I'm feeling it right now too, and I don't even watch nerd shows!!




Narrator: ARE YOU MAKING THE BEST USE OF YOUR TIME?
T-Rex: Yep!!
T-Rex: No, wait, scratch that.
T-Rex: 100% DEFINITELY NOT.
T-Rex: The best use of my time would be if I'm using every single moment to its fullest potential, right? And we live in a universe wherein our past decisions affect what future we get (THANKS A LOT, REALITY), so blowing even a SINGLE moment fifteen years ago could make my present suboptimal.
T-Rex: Put it another way: if every decision creates zillions of alternate timelines, what are the odds I'm in the #1 best one??
Utahraptor: Vanishingly small.
T-Rex: A'yup!
T-Rex: But that's freeing! NOBODY is the best person they can be. Whatever we do with our lives is a) probably not our best destiny, SORRY, and b) we're not even doing them as well as we could! We're all screwups!
Utahraptor: You sure know how to inspire a dude, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I SURE DO!!
Banner: Today I screwed up, but not as much as I could've
T-Rex (punchline): Yaaaaay




T-Rex: God, give me a beat!
God: BOOP BOOP BA-DOOPA DOOP
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: They call me <b> cause my flow be bold / Been writing HTML since I was 12 years old!
T-Rex: There ain't a word in the spec that I don't know / for example the  tag means a new table row!
Dromiceiomimus: Babe you got <center> tags all over and your shit's all deprecated / With such sloppy markup language, can't BELIEVE we ever dated
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus you better not be bringing HTML 5 all up in here / Cause if it ain't got itself a <blink> tag then it's STRICTLY second tier
Utahraptor: "Blink"? Pshaw. I bet you're not even XML-strict. Your doctype reads "-//1.0 MY//ASS GOT KICKED//"
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: Can't follow what I'm sayin so I'll underline it for you / <span style="&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;">SLAPPED DOWN</span> is all I really gotta do
T-Rex: When I hit <u> you gonna take it on the chin / 80 years later, you're STILL typing markup in!
Utahraptor: Man, you're a friend equivalent of IE 5:
Off panel: No-one wants you around or even wants you still alive!
T-Rex: Well YOU'RE the friend equivalent of CSS / All hot and sexy, knowing how to impress / Making bros pull out their heterosexuality to reassess
T-Rex: Man! It happened again!!
T-Rex (punchline): WHY DO MY FREESTYLES ALWAYS END UP SUPER GAY




T-Rex: I really don't understand racism. I get it at a "hey, here's what it is" level, but I don't understand how someone can really BE racist. Don't they feel kind of... ridiculous?
T-Rex: Anyway! With this in mind, I am going to become totally racist!!
T-Rex: But in order to keep my friends and Status in Society, I am going to be fake racist. I'm going to be racist against folks who - who say "y'all".
Dromiceiomimus: That's still an identifiable group of society, T-Rex!
T-Rex: TRUE. Plus I too say "y'all" when the situation demands it of me. Okay, I'm racist against people who... wear running shoes to the opera?
Utahraptor: Wow, you hate people who appreciate culture but who can't afford expensive artifacts?
T-Rex: FINE. NO I DON'T.
T-Rex: Look, the whole point was to experience prejudice from the inside. I just need a safe racism!
Utahraptor: You need something random. How about folks who have red hair?
T-Rex: That's genetic! Utahraptor! That's the worst fake racism yet!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Okay. Everyone, pick a number between one and ten!
Off panel: If I pick nine, you'd better not be racist against me!
T-Rex: HEY. HEY.
T-Rex (punchline): NO PROMISES




T-Rex: Alright, I think I have gotten the "hang" of this "Twitter" thing. I've figured it out! I've CRACKED THE CODE.
T-Rex: It's a place for me to talk to my friends!
T-Rex: But also a place where I can talk so that strangers who want to listen in on me can hear me talking to my friends. Okay, that's a thing. I guess that's fine though?
Dromiceiomimus: Think of it as broadcasting to the world!
T-Rex: GOT IT.
T-Rex: Attention world!! I ate a sandwich, please RT! #sandwichtime
Utahraptor: No, you can do it better!
Utahraptor: Think of it as a way to share important information with your friends: all the good stuff you're sure they'd care about.
T-Rex: Got it. A way to share the most important sentiments I have, the top tier things I have going on!
Utahraptor: Exactly!
T-Rex: Perfect.
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex (punchline): Players only love you when they're playing!!! PLEASE RT




T-Rex: Oh my God, I had the best sleep last night. The best sleep ever. It was - it was such a good sleep. Easily, EASILY the best sleep of my life.
T-Rex: Therefore, it's all downhill from here!
T-Rex: No sleep could possibly compare with my sleep from last night! Even in the sleep of death I will be all, "this sleep is pretty good, but man, that OTHER sleep I had? It was rad. It was so RAD."
T-Rex: I will spend all my time being dead remembering that sleep. How could I not? This was a sleep for the ages.
Utahraptor: Hey, are you still going on about that sleep?
T-Rex: SURE AM, sweetcheeks!
T-Rex: Wait, what?? Sweetcheeks? I'm sorry, I don't know where that came from. I don't normally call people "sweetcheeks"!
Utahraptor: It's alright! My cheeks ARE pretty sweet. Maybe they just got the better of you, sugarbuns!
Narrator: HAPPY "CALL PEOPLE 'SWEETCHEEKS'" DAY
Narrator (punchline): THE HOLIDAY FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEPT REALLY WELL LAST NIGHT?




T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a man who bragged to a king that his daughter could spin straw into gold. This absurd claim was entirely without merit.
Narrator: THE STORY OF RUMPELSTILTSKIN
Narrator: as told in the 19th century
T-Rex: The king locked the girl in a room filled with straw and said if she didn't spin it all into gold, he'd murder her. Kings, right? The girl was doomed, but then a small man appeared and offered to accomplish this impossible task for a small fee! And incredibly, he did. The next morning, the king demanded the girl repeat the trick, and anyway long story short the girl ended up deeply in debt to the nice man who kept helping her.
T-Rex: Since he was nice, he said he'd forgive the debt if she guessed his name! AND he gave her infinite guesses.
Utahraptor: Super nice!
T-Rex: The girl guessed name after name but none were correct. Finally her friend spied on the man, discovered his real name, and told the girl. When the girl said "Your name is Rumpelstiltskin!", the man was FURIOUS. He screamed "The devil told you that!!" over and over.
T-Rex: Then in a rage he stomped his right foot deep into the ground, burying it up to his waist. Then he grabbed his left foot with both hands, and screaming, tore himself in two, right up the middle. THE END.
T-Rex (punchline): THE MORAL: NIGHTMARES WALK AMONG US




T-Rex: The immigrant experience:
T-Rex: ...what's the deal?
T-Rex: Well, if you ask ME, I'd say it's the experience of "immigrating", if you will, to a new country. Coupled, of course, with the emigrant experience of leaving your old country behind!
Dromiceiomimus: That's all you've got?
T-Rex: I'm in over my head, Dromiceiomimus! I've totally barely ever immigrated!
Utahraptor: I've never been to the bottom of the ocean, but I still know there's freaky-ass transparent fish there!
T-Rex: FINE.
T-Rex: I'll go learn about immigration, okay? And then I'll return here in exactly 24 hours and dazzle you with the nuances of my new, hyperinformed opinion synthesized from my own reactions to the many viewpoints I've encountered, alright??
Utahraptor: Okay, sure!
Narrator: 23 HOURS LATER, AT THE VIDEO STORE:
T-Rex: Excuse me, do you guys have any movies about "the immigrant experience?" It's an emergency!
Off panel: Yes!
T-Rex: ...Starring Robocop?
Off panel: No.
T-Rex (punchline): Maaaaaaaaaan




Narrator: ORIGINALLY:
T-Rex: Who cares about feelings?
T-Rex: I tell it like it is!
Narrator: THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL GRACES
Narrator: VICTORIAN TIMES:
T-Rex: My lady, wouldst thou be so kind as to prepare me my dinner and birth me my babies?
Dromiceiomimus: Good sir, my heart is aflutter! I will do as you ask.
T-Rex: You have my thanks!
T-Rex: Quickly, now.
Narrator: THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION:
Utahraptor: Let's have (emotionally speaking) consequence-free sex!
T-Rex: What's the secret word?
Utahraptor: Please!
Narrator: THE PRESENT DAY:
T-Rex: Is it still alright to hold a door open for a lady?
Utahraptor: Hmm... I think so, as long as you'd let her hold it open for you.
T-Rex: Now that's fair to BOTH genders!
Narrator: THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: Who cares about feelings?!
Multiple off-panel voices: We tell it like it is!
T-Rex: Damn right! That's because we're all part of a cybernetic collective consciousness.
T-Rex and multiple off-panel voices (punchline): AGREED




T-Rex: It is a fact that we don't know everything and probably never will! Therefore, part of being alive is agreeing on what we believe to be real.
T-Rex: This is called the "consensus reality!"
T-Rex: Among our consensuses are things we believe but can't objectively prove, like "murders are bad so don't do any, not even if you'd really like to" and "cannibalism is bad too but maybe you can do it sometimes if things are SUPER crazy, but definitely wait at least a little bit before you start digging in." It's a SOCIALLY-CONSTRUCTED reality!!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but there's never just one consensus!
T-Rex: There's not?
Utahraptor: In a religious society everyone's living in a very different reality than an atheist one, but both are agreed to be real by members of those societies. So there's no one consensus reality, but by changing your beliefs, you CAN move between them!
T-Rex: That's great, because in MY reality, I can hear God, but lately he's big into 90s nostalgia and so mostly just talks about that.
God: HEY T-REX DO YOU REMEMBER BATTLETOADS
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): I am open to trading up




T-Rex: It's neat how most of our key verbs are just one syllable long! I think that verbs we use a lot change to short words with time, since if they did NOT, it would take a real long time to say all the run-of-the-mill thoughts we have!
T-Rex: We'd get bored each time we'd try to talk!
T-Rex: Sex! Love! Hate! BONE. All are rad AND short verbs! I bet you could use just short WORDS and find it to be not that hard of a trick!
Dromiceiomimus: You might end up with an odd phrase or two, though, since you'd have to steer clear of all 'ing' verbs.
T-Rex: Well, that verb form is for chumps! That's right! I said it! That verb form is for true chumps.
Utahraptor: Do you have some sort of proof for this "short means key" view?
T-Rex: In fact I do!
T-Rex: There's a set store of short words, right? A hoard, if you will. If we used all the short word forms for weird and rare verbs, like, I don't know, "to eat a lot of pork", then it would take a long time to share a thought that did not come down to "Dudes! I want to eat pigs!"
Utahraptor: Come on! That's not a proof!
T-Rex: I have one word for you, my friend!
Off panel: Yes?
T-Rex (punchline): Daaaaaaaaaamn




T-Rex: Pantheism is the belief that everything, the entire universe, is literally God!
God: WHAT
T-Rex: Like I said! The universe and God are the exact same thing!
T-Rex: We all get to be divine, Dromiceiomimus! Better, everything I do is an act of God! Right now, THIS aspect of God wants to stomp on this other, more housey aspect of God.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure that's how pantheism works! Isn't it more like, we're all cells in the "body" of a divine universe?
T-Rex: I see it more like, every tasty thing in the universe is God, and I'm getting HUNGRY.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're just redefining "God" to mean "existence"!
T-Rex: Perhaps!
T-Rex: But PERHAPS by making everything special, by spreading that divinity around a bit so that everyone gets a piece, we'll all see our world as the extraordinary place it is.
Utahraptor: Right. Or more likely, you just want to say "I'M GOD AND GOD WANTS GODLY SANDWICHES".
God: GOD DOES WANT GODLY SANDWICHES T-REX
T-Rex: Dude! It's not like you can't just make your own!
God (punchline): I LIKE IT WHEN YOU CUT OFF THE CRUSTS




T-Rex: [thinks] naked people
T-Rex: Hot!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, what's your opinion on people who are naked?
Dromiceiomimus: I would think that they are hot!
T-Rex: I would be forced to agree with you my good lady!!
Utahraptor: I too would agree with you re: hot naked people, my friend!
Narrator: THE END
Narrator: POSTSCRIPT:
T-Rex (punchline): Hott!!




T-Rex: Alright! New novel: done! This one is a romance, and is called:
T-Rex: "Pretzels In A Lady's Lap"!
T-Rex: It's named after a particularly striking scene from the book! We’re at a party, and a young man accidentally spills pretzels, as he walks by, into the titular Lady’s lap! She looks up: eyes meet, bosoms - on both sides - heave, passions smoulder, and, perhaps... romance blossoms?
Utahraptor: Hey, what’s so sensual about pretzels?
T-Rex: Dude!
Utahraptor: No, really! They’re dry and salty.
T-Rex: I’ve always found them to be pretty sensual.
Utahraptor: I’m pretty sure you’re the only one!
T-Rex: Really? Huh! Nobody else finds pretzels stimulating?
T-Rex (punchline): Well, this has been quite the anagnorisis (a moment of recognition or discovery)!




T-Rex: There are a lot of problems in the world! Someone ought to do something.
T-Rex: Wait a second!
T-Rex: I'M someone!!
T-Rex: Okay Dromiceiomimus, I'M going to do something about all the problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Great attitude, T-Rex! And I'm sure people already working on problems will appreciate the help. Which problem(s) are you going to focus on?
T-Rex: Uh... all of them?
Utahraptor: Might help to focus on one or two of them.
T-Rex: Of COURSE! Utahraptor - that's IT!
T-Rex: There's BILLIONS of people alive right now, and surely - SURELY - there's not actually BILLIONS of problems. If everyone take one problem each and solve it, then it won't be a lick of work! And then we could have this licked lickety-split!
Off panel: Great, I'll take solving the problem of world hunger!
T-Rex: And I'll take our sudden overuse of lick-based idioms! It doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'm sure I can lick it into shape!
T-Rex (punchline): OH NO, IT'S GETTING WORSE




T-Rex: Let us suppose that, rather than Bruce Wayne's parents getting killed by Gotham muggers, they're killed off the coast of Africa while on safari!
T-Rex: So rather than being raised by his butler, Bruce is raised by wild apes!
T-Rex: Now, this Bruce would obviously still be an exceptionally brilliant, driven, and fearless young man with an innate thirst for justice. Competing with apes would train him to peak human physicality, just as he would otherwise in Gotham. In fact, all that WOULD change is his theme: instead of bat-ropes, vines. Instead of a Kevlar bodysuit, an animal-skin loincloth.
T-Rex: In other words, Bruce Wayne...
Utahraptor: ...would become TARZAN OF THE APES.
T-Rex: YES.
T-Rex: Tarzan is nothing but primitivist alternate-universe Batman fanfic!!
Utahraptor: Tarzan came out BEFORE Batman, dude. Tarzan isn't "Jungle Batman". BATMAN is "City Tarzan, but also he's rich, and also there's a murder clown, a riddle enthusiast, some talking clay and a man who hates being warm".
Off panel: T-Rex, I know you love Batman, but you need to accept the truth. Batman is nothing more than AU TARZAN FANFIC.
T-Rex: Ow!!
T-Rex: Dude, your ideas, they're --
T-Rex (punchline): they're SO WRONG that I think they're physically hurting me




T-Rex: So this guy is at a bar and he's a heterosexual and he's trying to pick up women!
T-Rex: And he notices this woman who's pretty small!
T-Rex: And he says "Hey baby, you remind me of my coffee table!" And she says, "Why? Because I'm so small and cute?" and he says, "No, because I'm going to stub my toe on you later ton-
T-Rex: Wait, hold on, I messed up the joke. Hold on.
T-Rex: Wait.
Utahraptor: Maybe she reminds him of his little toe?
T-Rex: YES!
T-Rex: Because he's going to bang her on the coffee table later! YES! THAT WAS THE JOKE. Okay, thanks Utahraptor. I'm going to go back in time to do it right.
Utahraptor: Good luck! This timeline dies with you. Remember us, so that we might still live.
T-Rex: My friend, I shall. Always.
Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: And he says "Because I'm going to stub you on the coffee table later!"
T-Rex: ...

Narrator: 2010:
T-Rex: Hi! So hey, here's an idea: stop sharing stupid articles on Facebook!
Narrator: STOP SHARING STUPID ARTICLES ON FACEBOOK
Narrator: an e-card
T-Rex: The problem is as such: you post a stupid article that's barely above "FW: FW: FW: RE: FW: FW: a discredited paragraph from 1993" - AND SOMETIMES IT IS JUST LITERALLY THAT - and it's not like it's a one-off.
Dromiceiomimus: It keeps happening.
T-Rex: It's like you're the world's finest researcher in the field of Incorrect Ideas, sharing your latest finds!!
Narrator: 2011:
Utahraptor: Also I'm pretty sure you're racist.
T-Rex: DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT BUT YEP
Narrator: 2016:
T-Rex: Also you're ruining the internet and also maybe society??
Utahraptor: YEP
Narrator: 2056:
T-Rex: Also remember when Facebook was optional and we didn't destroy civilization on the behalf of a website initially built to rate, without their consent, whether women in your classes were hotter than a randomly-chosen farm animal??
Off panel (punchline): I do not




T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe, I have things to do today! We can't hang out the entire time.
Off panel: I don't want to hang out the ENTIRE time, T-Rex, I just want quality time when we DO hang out. I need quality, not just quantity!
T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe! You are so needy.
Off panel: When you call me "needy", T-Rex, you make me feel like I'm crazy, just because I want to spend time with you! That's not crazy: that's what friends do. If you don't want to be friends with me then we should talk about that, but if you do, then you need to spend more time with me.
T-Rex: Edgar! We're spending time together RIGHT NOW. That counts! It HAS to count if you follow me around.
Utahraptor: Hey, your friend back there looks just like Edgar Allan Poe! That's crazy!
T-Rex: That's because he is!
T-Rex: Hey, here's a fun fact for you: Edgar Allan Poe has access to a time machine, and ALL HE WANTS TO DO is talk about our relationship.
Utahraptor: T-Rex! He's right nearby! He can probably hear you.
T-Rex: I'M FINE WITH THAT. HELLO POE.
Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: I'm sorry I snapped at you, Edgar Allan Poe!
Off panel: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you when you said you needed space, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Can you - can you keep this out of your famous and memorable poems, do you think?




T-Rex: Even in olden times, stories got terrible sequels! This myth is ACTUAL FOLLOWUP to the famous "King Midas Messes Up His 'Everything I Touch Turns To Gold' Wish, And How".
Narrator: KING MIDAS 2: YOUR ASS IS GRASS
Narrator: it is horrible
T-Rex: So after Midas got over his gold thing, he started chilling with Pan, of "pan flute" fame. And one day Pan and the god Apollo had a battle of the bands! Midas claimed Pan won, but Pan played a crappy 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' rendition on his dinky flute, and Apollo was like, "Dude, I ROCKED 'Chopin's Impromptu No. 4' on my lyre."
T-Rex: "The lyre is that weird U-shaped harp you're probably thinking of," Apollo added.
T-Rex: Midas still claimed Pan won, so Apollo cursed him with ass's ears!
Utahraptor: Which are donkey ears if you're not rude!
T-Rex: Midas used his crown to cover them, but his barber obviously found out and had to tell SOMEONE. So he dug a hole and whispered "King Midas has ass's ears!" into it, as one does. Then grass sprang up, whispering the same phrase to passers-by!
Utahraptor: When Midas found out everyone knew, he died of embarrassment.
T-Rex: The failure of Midas 2 ensured there would be no Midas 3, which was a planned prequel wherein Young Midas wished everything he touched turned to ears.
T-Rex (punchline): THE END.




T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes, who wore a deerstalker (or "Sherlock Holmes hat"), and who was the best at solving mysteries in case you've been living under a rock -
T-Rex: - or else in a different culture which would obviously have different cultural touchstones -
T-Rex: - frowned. He'd finally found a mystery he couldn't crack! Sherlock had made his whole thing about being the "solving mysteries guy", so this was REALLY bad for him.
T-Rex: Everyone was staring at him as he went over the body with his magnifying glass for the third time. This normally didn't take this long.
T-Rex: Sherlock started to sweat. Who was he without his deductions?
Utahraptor: Just a man with a cool hat!
T-Rex: Cool Hat Man, as Sherlock was starting to think of himself, was in way over his head. In desperation, he feigned confidence and announced that a "Mr. Stabsworth" from out of town did it, so, he explained, it made sense that nobody knew him. The police and onlookers dispersed, satisfied.
T-Rex: Later that evening Sherlock started doing drugs, which until the day he died he claimed was due to "being so bored when there's no mysteries because I'm so good at mysteries". THE END.
T-Rex (punchline): PS: THIS IS A TRAGEDY




T-Rex: There are several problems in the world! So here's an idea, everyone...
T-Rex: ...how about you FIX the problems, huh??
T-Rex: See, SOME people see a problem and don't even think to demand that it be fixed. Not me! Guess I'm just not like other people. Guess I'm just a bit better.
Dromiceiomimus: You have any ideas on how precisely to FIX these problems, or...?
T-Rex: An important part of civilization is SPECIALIZATION. I have specialized in pointing out problems, others must specialize in solving them!
Utahraptor: ...Huh!
T-Rex: Yes! "Impressed 'huh'"!
Utahraptor: Well I'VE specialized in solving the problems, and have accordingly determined that the issue is everyone thinks problems are for OTHERS to solve, and so don't themselves contribute to a solution!
T-Rex: ...
Off panel: T-Rex, you can't just ignore me and leave!!
T-Rex: That's so weird, Utahraptor!
T-Rex (punchline): My years of experience and specialization are SCREAMING otherwise




T-Rex: I wonder, is there an essential "feminine", one that trancends histories and cultures?
T-Rex: Similarly, could I myself be the essential "masculine"?
T-Rex: Why, I believe I could! What am I besides the real, true essence of "male-ness", the invariable and fixed properties which define masculine for now and forever?
T-Rex: I sure am great!
T-Rex: Truly, I am the epitome of the male form!
Utahraptor: I disagree!
Utahraptor: I think it's pretty clear, T-Rex, that I am the epitome of the male form.
Utahraptor: And you'd better call a plumber, because these pipes are going to burst!
T-Rex: "Pipes" means "muscles", right?
T-Rex: That's slang, right?
T-Rex (punchline): Slang of today's youth culture?




T-Rex: One day Batman, who was the best at solving crime, faced the impossible... A CRIME HE COULDN'T SOLVE.
T-Rex: Oh snap, we're one sentence in and already there's a stunning twist!!
T-Rex: The crime was a minor one: someone had stolen a candy bar from the local convenience store. The criminal, WHOEVER THEY WERE, was careful: they wore a hoodie, left no fingerprints or DNA, quietly slipped the choco into their pocket, and left. The crime hadn't even been noticed until Batman himself reviewed the camera footage a week later as part of a different case, which itself was part of his really justified war on crime!
Utahraptor: What was the first case he was investigating?
T-Rex: A slight case... OF MURDER.
T-Rex: And as the murder was clearly a more pressing case, and as the shopkeep didn't want to press charges, Batman had neither the time, resources, nor the permission to solve the case. It was quite literally the case he couldn't solve, and that's how some snack loving rando beat Batman!
Narrator: A FEW SLEEPLESS NIGHTS LATER:
T-Rex: I CAN'T DO IT, I CAN'T LIVE A LIE!! LATER ON BATMAN CAUGHT THE CANDY BAR CRIMINAL, BATMAN DEFINITELY CAUGHT HIM
T-Rex: I'M SORRY I DOUBTED YOU, BATMAN
T-Rex (punchline): I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING




T-Rex: "Garden path" sentences are those that trick you into thinking that they will mean one thing, but then as you read more of the sentence, that meaning is shown to be false!
T-Rex: For instance: "The horse raced past the barn fell"!
Dromiceiomimus: Why, that sentence is senseless!
T-Rex: Aha, my friend, so it would seem! But it actually refers to a horse, which at some point in the past was raced past a barn, and now that same horse has fallen over!
Utahraptor: That sentence is stupid!
T-Rex: What are you saying?
Utahraptor: What I'm SAYING is that nobody would ever say that. They'd say, "The horse that I raced past the barn has now fallen over"!
T-Rex: Well, they could, but they could ALSO say my sentence!
Utahraptor: Only if they were incurably insane! Do horses even fall over?
T-Rex: Sure man, all the time!
T-Rex (punchline): Farmers call them nature's dominoes!




T-Rex: Oh my gosh! I could spend weekends somewhere else under an assumed name! Two towns over, I could be known as... PUNCHES MALONE.
Narrator: T-REX HAS THE BEST IDEA EVER COMICS
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure how serious you are, T-Rex, but it's a great idea! Two towns over I'M known as "Ornithomimus J. Edmontonicus".
T-Rex: Seriously?
Dromiceiomimus: I wear a top hat and monocle.
T-Rex: SERIOUSLY??
Utahraptor: Oh man, is she serious?
T-Rex: Is she being totally serious to our faces right now??
T-Rex: I mean, there's no reason why it couldn't be true, right? It would just mean that Dromiceiomimus has been LIVING the friggin' DREAM while we've been sitting around, NOT cultivating sweet double lives.
Utahraptor: We need to go two towns over and start building our own alter egos!
Off panel: You guys, I also carry a cane with a skull on the top and wear a jacket made of the finest feathers.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, come back!
T-Rex (punchline): I hate to make up words, but reality just got even more awesometasticerest!!




T-Rex: I think urban legends start because someone tells a story, and then their friends who heard it tell it again and make it MORE FANTASTIC. This makes sense.
T-Rex: Folks just want to tell increasingly awesome stories!
T-Rex: This is why I always discount stories that "happened to a friend", or "happened to a guy I know" - you can probably be pretty sure that SOMETHING happened to some dude SOMETIME, but not much beyond that!
Dromiceiomimus: What urban legend did you hear? The one where a woman eats a hot dog but then it's actually a real dog?
T-Rex: No. That one's super dumb.
Utahraptor: I heard it was real!!
T-Rex: No you didn't!
T-Rex: You didn't because Dromiceiomimus just made it up. There's no way you could mistake a hot dog for a real dog. One's delicious and the other's made of hot dog meat!
T-Rex: That was an extremely funny joke, Utahraptor! You should be laughing right now. EVERYONE SHOULD BE LAUGHING, RIGHT NOW.
T-Rex (punchline): EVERYONE




T-Rex: In Scrabble, you and your friends pretend that you're unable to speak OR write, but luckily, you have a bunch of tiny pieces of wood with letters on them in your pockets! You each grab a handful and take turns chatting up each other.
Narrator: SCRABBLE AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: A grid is provided, so you put your letters down there. For example, you may want to start with "WHAT CAPRICIOUS GOD WOULD CRAFT THIS TERRIBLE FATE", but you won't have enough letters for that. So you'll fall back to "HELLO", but oops, no "E", so instead you open the conversation with "ABS". Your friend, in similar circumstances, might reply "HAT".
T-Rex: You'll stare at each other for a long moment.
Utahraptor: But there's points, aren't there?
T-Rex: Yeah, lots of points!
T-Rex: With words now meaningless, points do the heavy lifting for communication. 16 points might mean "I now realize how much I valued our easy intimacy", 42 points with a triple word score saying "Promise me you'll never forget how we were, before this game began."
Utahraptor: But it does end when the letters run out.
T-Rex: Yes! And you can all talk again, each word now precious, a gift. The players, having survived their ordeal, are brought closer together. It is, in the full sense of the word, a beautiful game.
T-Rex (punchline): Oh but if you try to spell a proper name you get SHOT the fuck DOWN




T-Rex: Spring break! Woo!
T-Rex: SPRING BREAAAA-
T-Rex: -AAAAAAAAAA-
T-Rex: -AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
T-Rex: -AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
Utahraptor: -AAAAAAAAAAAAA-
T-Rex and Utahraptor: -AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
T-Rex (punchline): -AAAK IS NOT SOMETHING I REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO AS AN ADULT




Narrator: HISTORY'S CHUMPS
T-Rex: History is full of chumps, you guys!!
T-Rex: Today's historical chump is William H. Mumler (born 1832), who was a photographer guy who did portraits! Only he wasn't a very good photographer guy because one time he accidentally double-exposed some film, and the resulting image showed one portrait clearly, but also showed a ghostly image of the other portrait!
Utahraptor: So he threw it away and reminded himself to not make that dumb mistake anymore?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: Instead he embarked on a career as a SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHER and made a lot of money duping a lot of people, including Abraham Lincoln's widow. Only, people eventually started to notice that his "ghosts" looked an awful lot like living people around town!
Utahraptor: Hah! Whoops!
T-Rex: They ALSO eventually noticed how he was breaking into their houses so he could look at photographs and figure out what his ghosts were supposed to look like.
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway like everyone else from history he eventually died and now his entire life has been compressed to a short story, the end!




Narrator: MAYBE WE CAN INVENT A FOOD
T-Rex: Why READ someone else's old recipe when you could be WRITING your own new one??
T-Rex: Let's answer that question with terrible, hard-earned experience!
T-Rex: So first we should decide what kind of a food we want to eat, basing it on previous foods we've enjoyed. For example, I like to eat ice cream and meat.
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe some meat-themed frozen confection?
T-Rex: That sounds like meat-themed frozen perfection!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, good
T-Rex: First, get five pounds of ground beef!
Utahraptor: Then get five pounds of ice cream!
T-Rex: Fold the raw meat into the ice cream, and brown in a giant frying pan. The ice cream will melt, sugars will burn, and grease will float on top of it all. Will this taste good? WHO KNOWS??
Utahraptor: All I know is that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs!
T-Rex: That reminds me, throw some eggs into this! Then add salt to taste, and add more eggs to taste too. Serve in a bathtub and garnish with fifty dollar bills!
T-Rex (punchline): Serves one (1) person who you are fine if they don't ever come over anymore!




T-Rex: I'm not going to leave what happens to me after I die up to others. What if they put on a weaksauce funeral?
T-Rex: People might equate a weaksauce funeral with a correspondingly weaksauce dude!
T-Rex: Worse, what if they bury me in an UNCOOL part of the graveyard?
Dromiceiomimus: Aww, we wouldn't do that, T-Rex! We would bury you with all the cool kids.
T-Rex: Perhaps! But I've decided to solve this problem ONCE AND FOR ALL by arranging my own funeral, plot and gravestone myself. Tada!
Utahraptor: This has actually been done before, my friend!
T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yep! It is a growing trend in the "moribund set". People get everything set up in advance! You can even visit your own grave if you want - the expiry date gets filled in when you die.
T-Rex: Spooky!
Utahraptor: Not really, since there's nothing buried there yet! It is pure FORESHADOWING.
T-Rex: Huh! It seems less cool, knowing that it's been done before. But I guess I COULD still visit my grave and pretend to be a time traveller who's changed the past! The whole "Noo! I changed the past!" idea. You know?
T-Rex (punchline): Like I'm surprised at how sucky a time traveller I am?




T-Rex: Once upon a time a boy cried "wolf" a lot, even when there weren't wolves around! His friends were all, "Frig man, if you play with fire you're gonna get burned!"
T-Rex: (THIS IS A REFERENCE TO ANOTHER, UNRELATED FABLE.)
T-Rex: Anyway this kid had sheep and watched them all day, so he cried "wolf!" to keep himself entertained. But one day a wolf DID come and it ate all his sheep! He cried "wolf!" but nobody came to help since, HISTORICAL MORAL TIME, "men bileve not lyghtly hym whiche is knowen for a lyer".
Dromiceiomimus: Women either!
T-Rex: Right! "Nyther men nor rockyn babes".
Utahraptor: This one wolf ate all his sheep? ALL of them. Every single one. Every sheepen got eaten.
T-Rex: All gone!
Utahraptor: What, did this boy have tiny bite-sized sheep? Was he running a sheep farm for ants?!
T-Rex: Yeah, he was. It's where the ant from the last fable got his food.
Utahraptor: Oh. Okay.
Utahraptor: Well nevermind then
T-Rex: The next day the wolf put on sheep's clothing and used it to eat everyone else's sheep too! This vindicated the boy, but it was too late: he'd already died of plague.
T-Rex: Olden times, man!
T-Rex (punchline): NEVER LIVE THERE.




T-Rex: Zombies versus vampires! They're the new pirates versus ninjas versus ants that combined themselves together to form the shape of a giant ant!
T-Rex: And the question is: who would win in a fight?
T-Rex: Unfortunately the question is ridiculous because zombies and vampires have no reason to be fighting. Vampires drink blood and zombie blood is all decayed and pooling in their feet. They wouldn't be interested! Correspondingly, zombies eat brains and vampires -
T-Rex: - okay maybe they would fight sometimes.
Utahraptor: And zombies would win, obviously!
T-Rex: Obviously!!
T-Rex: If you're bitten by a zombie then you become a zombie, so all the vampires would eventually be vampire zombies!
Utahraptor: Except if you're bitten by a vampire you become a vampire, so all the zombies would eventually become zombie vampires.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
Off panel: T-Rex!
T-Rex and off panel (punchline): This is the most poignant example of the futility of war that we've ever seen!!




T-Rex: Which chest pains are, like...
T-Rex: ...the GOOD chest pains?
Dromiceiomimus: Don't say that, T-Rex, it'll make me laugh and that aggravates my chest pains!
T-Rex: Oh no, thinking about other people's chest pains aggravates MY chest pains!
Dromiceiomimus: Hah!
Dromiceiomimus: Ouch
Utahraptor: You guys want some chest pains? I got some. I think I got, like... extras?
T-Rex: No, we're good!
T-Rex: Why do we even have pain sensors inside our chests? Why would we evolve to feel pain in the first place? Why can't I just get a text message inside my head that says "oh hey your heart is boned" and I can click "whatever, I had a good run" and we leave it at that?
God: T-REX BE COOL IT'S JUST A FRACTURED RIB
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex (punchline): "Just"




T-Rex: Shoot! I forgot to have a shower this morning.
T-Rex: That's funny, because I smell fine!
Dromiceiomimus: That's funny, because you never seem showered whenever I see you.
T-Rex: That's funny, because I don't seem to recall soliciting comments!
Utahraptor: That's funny, because you always voice every single thought in your head!
T-Rex: That's funny, because at least I have thoughts!
Utahraptor: Well that's funny, because no you don't!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE...
T-Rex: Sure! I'd love to come to your dinner party!
T-Rex (punchline): Why yes, I am freshly showered!




T-Rex: Everyone! A new dude has moved in down the street from me!
T-Rex: And I'm PRETTY SURE he's a spy??
Dromiceiomimus: Why? What, does he dress all in black and prank another spy dressed all in white?
T-Rex: NOTHING SO GAUCHE. But check this: he speaks seven different languages, he's really handsome, he wears suits, and I'm pretty sure he knows a lot about guns AND documents. I asked him what his favourite type of document was and I could tell he SO wanted to say "Stole-- I mean, no preference".
Utahraptor: Maybe he's just a sartorialist polyglot?
T-Rex: A spy, yeah!
Utahraptor: No, maybe he's just a guy who dresses well and speaks many languages. A well-educated, confident man. You know... THE KIND OF GUY YOU WISH YOU WERE??
T-Rex: ...Oh my god you're right. Oh my god. You're totally right.
T-Rex: HE'S ME FROM THE FUTURE.
Off panel: You ignored my awesome sick burn and in doing so transformed it into... the setup for a time-travelling adventure? I gotta say, I'm impressed!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex (punchline): My ultimate faith in our friendship has paid off YET AGAIN!!




God: IT'S TIME FOR ROMANCE TIPS WITH T-REX
T-Rex: Yes! Today is the day for some tips on how to convince yourself that no matter what you'll never find anyone bett-
T-Rex: Okay! Today is the day for some tips on being romantic!
T-Rex: Flowers are nice, for all sexes and genders! They're pretty and also - smell pretty? Also! It can be romantic to tell someone that you love them. Also, um.
T-Rex: Okay, so here's the thing. Probably there is someone out there who's better suited with you. The odds of you both having found the ONE person who's absolutely best for you, no matter what system you use to rank "bestness", are pretty small.
T-Rex: But!
Utahraptor: But?
T-Rex: BUT.
T-Rex: Let's say you're happy with person A (95% perfect) and you meet person B who is 99% perfect. It doesn't make sense to leave person A for B if you've been with them for years! You lose out on all your shared history, and that's like a times two multiplier!
Utahraptor: Romance?
T-Rex: Romance with a times two multiplier!
God: OKAY SO
God: ROMANCE TIPS WITH T-REX WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA
T-Rex (punchline): ...Righty-o




T-Rex: The problem with Valentine's Day is that, if you get your sweetie chocolates, the sweetness of the gesture is tainted with some measure of Societal Expectation!
T-Rex: That's the problem with Valentine's Day!
T-Rex: And that's all I have to say on the subject!!
Utahraptor: T-Rex!
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: WHAT?
Utahraptor: I got you a chocolate
T-Rex: These chocolates don't taste like they're tainted by Societal Expectation at all. Thank you Utahraptor!
Off panel: You're welcome!
T-Rex: They taste a little like ironic comeuppance, but -
T-Rex (punchline): I like that flavour.




Narrator: PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES:
T-Rex: Global overpopulation!
T-Rex: Also global underpopulation, and also global just right population. Basically anything to do with population: BALL'S IN THEIR COURT.
Dromiceiomimus: Also anything to do with heredity: their fault.
T-Rex: Yep! And anything to do with babies and ESPECIALLY the ones that barfed on me.
Narrator: PROBLEMS THAT CAN ONLY BE BLAMED ON HOMOSEXUAL COUPLES:
T-Rex: Um...
Utahraptor: NOT ENOUGH GAY SEXING
Narrator (punchline): THE END




Narrator: THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX THINKS EVERYONE SHOULD GO TO CLASS, BUT NOBODY IS GOING TO CLASS:
T-Rex: Why isn't anyone attending their classes? Guys! Class is on! It's time to go to class!
T-Rex: What the heck is wrong with everyone in this Universe?
T-Rex: I just don't understand why nobody is going to class.
Narrator: THE END
Narrator: THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE GOES TO CLASS BUT T-REX:
Utahraptor: You're late for class, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Dude, you know what I say? I say, "forget class!".
Utahraptor: You can't say that! Class is important! Class is really important.
T-Rex: Hello? I play by my own rules. Rule number one: no going to class, baby!
T-Rex: Rules two through five are various socio-economic and anarchic justifications for not going to class. Rule six says it's really too bad that all the ladies are in class right now!
T-Rex (punchline): My philosophy - she has her limitations.




Narrator: HOW TO WRITE STORIES WITH BOATS IN THEM
T-Rex: Aw, damn it.
T-Rex: Okay! First off, put all your characters in a boat RIGHT AWAY.
T-Rex: This will prevent you from writing yourself into a corner, where for example all your characters are in a desert shack when you need your boat to appear, which will then save you several chapters of your characters agreeing that when that boat rammed through the wall they all thought it made sense, and any third parties who heard tell of this and disagreed were simply not considering the matter closely enough.
Utahraptor: Okay, my characters are boat-borne! But how do I DESCRIBE the boat?
T-Rex: It can be tricky!
T-Rex: Words to include are "floating", "seaworthy", and "boat-esque". Those to avoid include "winged", "like a tub, from a bathroom, but big, and extremely specialized" and "if you can imagine a toy boat, but larger, or maybe if you imagined a toy boat with toy people on it first, and then make THAT larger".
Narrator: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU NOW HAVE NO EXCUSES NOT TO HAVE BOATS IN EVERY STORY YOU WRITE
Off panel: Writing's hard, huh?
T-Rex (punchline): Um, not anymore!!




T-Rex: I have to say it? You're really going to make me say it?
T-Rex: Because I'll say it!!
T-Rex: EVERYONE, we are producing WAY too much culture!
T-Rex: We all know nobody can read all the books being printed. Throw on top of that all movies, websites, people posting on social media, and it's like - who are y'all producing all this culture for? Seriously. Who?
T-Rex: It's not me! I'm not reading all y'alls Twitter!!
T-Rex: I'M JUST SCROLLING ON BY
Utahraptor: You know how peeps used to study medieval history and then they'd be an expert on medieval history?
T-Rex: Sure!
Utahraptor: Well THAT worked because we forgot most of what happened then! But with everything recorded forever now (THANKS, FACEBOOK AND THE NSA) we have enough data for expertise in SINGLE DAYS. Questions about October 26th 2015 will be answered by the dude with a PhD in Applied and Theoretical October 26th 2015 Studies!
T-Rex: ...I guess I'd better make today count then, huh? I wouldn't want to let down that future scholar! Or Facebook. Or the NSA.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): It's nice to be loved




Narrator: OPERATION: MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY: DAY FOUR
T-Rex: No response to my email proposing paltimes has been received. I am therefore, and reluctantly, forced to employ escalation tactics. As of 0800 hours...
T-Rex: ...I have sent a FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST.
Dromiceiomimus: Out of the blue? Wow. Gutsy move, man.
T-Rex: Bold? Yes. Daring? Absolutely. Brave, even intrepid? No doubt. For these are all qualities I possess - and qualities I'd be willing to share... WITH A FRIEND.
T-Rex: (That's what I wrote in my friend request, incidentally)
Narrator: OPERATION: MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY: DAY FIFTEEN
T-Rex: This may be my last entry.
Utahraptor: Oh no!
T-Rex: Morale low; supplies dwindling. Reconnaissance indicates he's accepted other friend requests sent AFTER mine. Only move left seems to be cancelling friend request and resending it. A desperate move. Desperate times.
Utahraptor: Dude, you wanna, like... get dinner or something?
Narrator: OPERATION: MAKE FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY: DAY THIRTY
T-Rex: WHAT THE HELL, now his Facebook shows him looking for jobs in ANOTHER COUNTRY?! This, my friends - THIS -
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): - this is why people decide to go live in the woods forever




T-Rex: Dudes!
T-Rex: There are a lot of friggin' religions!
T-Rex: And let's say you're a lady or fellow who thinks "Man, heaven sounds like okay times! I've GOT to get in on that action." But you're stymied, because which religion should you choose? There's like a billion different ones, and if you bet on the wrong horse then no heaven for you, chumpy!
T-Rex: My friends, I have the solution: The T-Rex System!
Utahraptor: Okay, I'll bite: what's the T-Rex System?
T-Rex: You overlap each and every religion in a Venn diagram!
T-Rex: THEN, you just look for the place of maximum overlap and follow the precepts there! Say you discover most religions say something like "Give to the poor": you know that by doing this, you're maximizing your Heaven Potential™ for HUNDREDS of religions at once! Plus, you're not wasting time on CRAZY and UNPOPULAR precepts.
Off panel: Um, what if the Judeo-Christian God exists and wants you to believe in no-one else but him?
T-Rex (punchline): Um, here's another hypothetical for you, Utahraptor: WHAT IF ALL GODS EXIST AND WHEN YOU DIE YOU COULD SPEND YOUR TIME IN LIKE 80 BILLION HEAVENS AT ONCE??




T-Rex: Man! Time for me to grow some friggin' FACIAL HAIR.
T-Rex: [imagines himself sporting handlebar mustache]
T-Rex: YES.
T-Rex: This is one situation where men have the clear gender advantage!
Utahraptor: Facial hair?
T-Rex: Yep! Sure, women get to feel the miracle of life growing inside them and the joy of birth or of laying eggs or WHATEVER, but we get to engineer hairy faces AT OUR LEISURE.
Utahraptor: I don't get why you're casting this in terms of a gender battle, but yeah- I'm with beards over babies too!
T-Rex: The way you say it - is there actually an organization called Beards over Babies?
Off panel: Not to my knowledge!
T-Rex: Dude, we have to start it!!
T-Rex (punchline): Our logo can be a big ol' beard hovering over a truly startled baby!




T-Rex: Okay so I didn't help anyone learn about computers yesterday. I MESSED UP. But we will fix that today! YES. Okay!
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: What IS a computer?
T-Rex: Scientists have studied them for years to come up with an answer to this question. These highly specialized scientists, known as "computer scientists", have given up on studying their own fleshy bodies to instead study the hard transistors, the finely sculpted semiconductors, and the gleaming metal bodies of our strange electronic offspring.
Utahraptor: This sounds kinda - sexy?
T-Rex: Damn dude, you know it is!
T-Rex: Computers may have quad-core processors instead of quadriceps, but to the computer scientist these "quads" are just as alluring as the muscles of any flesh Adonis!
Utahraptor: So what IS a computer?
T-Rex (punchline): PURE FREEBASED SEX.




T-Rex: Last night I dreamed I was out on a picnic table with all my personal electronics, and this group of kids thought it was a garage sale!
T-Rex: Okay YES I KNOW DREAMS ARE STUPID, but bear with me!
T-Rex: So these kids are picking up my stuff, but suddenly it's not my stuff, it's my friends' stuff, so I can't just give it away. And when I say "it's not for sale", they're grabbing them tighter and saying "Come on, I'm sure it is." So I yell for my friends and when they show up the kids leave, but then they come back... WITH KNIVES.
T-Rex: And THEN, I woke up!
Utahraptor: I thought you said this was a good story!
T-Rex: It is!
T-Rex: THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE. I used IMAGINATION to see what happens next! We defeated the kids using punches, and then you were secretly one kid on another kid's shoulders wearing a Utahraptor suit, so I had to punch you too!
Utahraptor: Huh. I guess I prefer your unconscious mind's stories to your conscious efforts?
T-Rex: My conscious mind says "ouch" but my unconscious says... "hey thanks me too"?! What the hell, unconscious!!
T-Rex: We're ALL on the same team, and you need to stay CONSCIOUS of that!
T-Rex: OH, SICK BURN
Off panel (punchline): So, um... I guess I'll talk to you later huh




T-Rex: You know what's the best thing ever?
T-Rex: The word "bicurious"!
T-Rex: It's funny when people use it, because how long can you be bicurious? You don't sit around all day saying, "Hmmm... I wonder what will happen!" - you look it up on the Internet, or you go out, meet someone in the gender you're interested in, and then afterwards roll over and say, "Curiosity satisfied!"
T-Rex: Then it's high fives all around!
T-Rex: You could say it like, "Curiosity: SATISFIED!"
Utahraptor: Talking up the word bicurious again?
T-Rex: It's a great word!
Utahraptor: For someone who says he isn't "bicurious" you sure spend a lot of time talking about it!
T-Rex: I almost wish I was bicurious, just so I could say, "Curiosity satisfied!"
T-Rex: I'd say it like,
T-Rex (punchline): "Curiosity... SATISFIED!!"




Narrator: COMICS WITH SUDDEN CHANGES IN GENRE II
T-Rex: I'm going nuts!
T-Rex: LIQUID NUTS!
T-Rex: See what I did there, Dromiceiomimus? I used "liquid" as an intensifier.
Dromiceiomimus: Like "super"?
T-Rex: Yep! It goes nuts, super nuts, nutty crackers, and then liquid nuts for only the nuttiest things.
Dromiceiomimus: Can this also be applied to chocolate bars?
T-Rex: YOU KNOW IT CAN'T. That would be heresy!
Utahraptor: Liquid heresy!
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: I do think "nuts" can be applied to chocolate bars though.
T-Rex: Okay honestly it can apply to chocolate bars, but it becomes confusing if the bar isn't crammed with nuts, or somehow liquidly nutty. There is a SEMANTIC COLLISION.
Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: Anyway, I meant what I said about going nuts. I feel like I've got this powerful instinct for self-destruction, and I'm just fooling myself if I think I can control it.
Off panel: You're so crazy, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm wacky times!




T-Rex: People are always crying that we need more punctuation marks to show things like sarcasm, sincerity, and so on. "Boo hoo hoo," they say, "the tears, they don't stop, abloo hoo hoo."
T-Rex: But we already have new punctuation, and only corporations use it!
T-Rex: I refer of course to the trademark symbol. Right now all it means is "I paid the government some money to make sure you can't say this sentence in the same places I get to say this sentence", but we can change that. We could use it to mean anything!™
Dromiceiomimus: Anything?™
T-Rex: Anything at all, baby!™
Utahraptor: It kinda just seems like you're saying corporate slogans back and forth.
T-Rex: Life's funny that way!™
Utahraptor: No, when you say short pithy things it's even worse.
T-Rex: Oh well!™ Language: it's weird!™
Utahraptor: T-Rex, listen: I don't want to live in your new utopia.
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!™
T-Rex (punchline): It's mandatory!!™




T-Rex: It's a new year! Time for us all to take stock of our lives or whatever.
T-Rex: And by that I mean, time to examine all our old mp3 files we have hanging around!
T-Rex: I downloaded these in the last CENTURY, Dromiceiomimus. There are cool teens ALIVE TODAY who are younger than some of these mp3 files.
Dromiceiomimus: Ooh, do they all have crappy tags too?
T-Rex: Some were ripped before tags were even a thing! They're all pirated, obviously, because THEY LITERALLY PREDATE THE IDEA OF LEGAL DIGITAL MUSIC. What the heck am I supposed to do with them?
Utahraptor: Delete them? So you don't go to jail for a billion years owing a billion dollars to billionaires?
T-Rex: I can't!
T-Rex: We're at the point now where they're HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS. Nobody wants a 96kbps mp3 of "Whoomp! (There It Is)". Mine may well be the only extant instance of this file, the last cultural memory we have of the murky beginnings of digital music!!
T-Rex: Utahraptor. This is my LEGACY.
Narrator: T-REX DONATES A HARD DRIVE FULL OF ONLY THE BIGGEST, SHINIEST 90S MEGAHITS TO THE SMITHSONIAN:
T-Rex: Thank me later, Smithsonian!
Off panel: Sir, you can't just leave your hard drive at the customer service desk.
T-Rex: I SAID
T-Rex (punchline): "THANK ME LATER, SMITHSONIAN"




Narrator: WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD DAY:
T-Rex: My favourite food is bread! It's the most delicious thing to eat before, during, and perhaps even after a meal!
Narrator: T-REX: BREAD
Dromiceiomimus: My favourite food is avocado sandwiches! They're fatty but really really delicious. I also like orange juice.
T-Rex: Everyone loves orange juice! Well, except for people who have cuts on their lips, but they've made their choice.
Narrator: DROMICEIOMIMUS: AVOCADO SANDWICHES, ORANGE JUICE
Utahraptor: My favourite food is - a secret!
T-Rex: Aw Utahraptor, that's dumb!
Utahraptor: No it's not! It makes me a little more mysterious, I think. It's like keeping your birthday a secret!
T-Rex: That's dumb too! The only people who do that are old people who don't want to age anymore and young people who - actually, I'm not sure if young people even do it.
T-Rex: Anyway! Back to bread: do I like it because it's so delicious, or is it so delicious because I like it?
Off panel: Can we avoid this conversation if I say my favourite food is sweet and sour chicken?
T-Rex (punchline): NOT ANYMORE.




T-Rex: Want to better yourself each and every day? Sure you do! So what are you waiting for??
T-Rex: MASTER A NEW SKILL ALREADY!
T-Rex: And before you say "mastering skills is hard, it takes literally WEEKS to figure out how to paint something like the Sistine Chapel, and possibly even longer??" let me say: you are defining skills TOO NARROWLY. Smaller things are skills too! For example, *I* am a master of breathing air without dying. I do it BASICALLY 24/7. Yeah. It's no big deal for me.
Utahraptor: I've seen you choke on your own saliva while attempting to breathe air.
T-Rex: Yes! In the PAST.
T-Rex: But since then I've been practicing LITERALLY NON-STOP, and now I'm better at it. Ask me how my "squeeze my heart to pump blood through my body" practice has been going.
Utahraptor: How's it been going?
T-Rex: PRETTY GREAT!
T-Rex: I hereby declare everyone hearing these words a MASTER of breathing and pumping blood, except those few who are dying from suffocation or heart failure as I speak. To them I say: WHAT ARE YOU DOING, CALL AN AMBULANCE
T-Rex (punchline): AHHHHHHHHHH




T-Rex: If I ever turn into a werewolf, I would DEFINITELY donate my still-living body to science! The reason is simple: I Care About Science.
T-Rex: Guys! The advances would be incredible!
T-Rex: I'd have a body that would CHANGE SHAPE in response to the light of a full moon. That's insane! If we could harness the powers of my sweet-ass hairy body, the advances would be incredible! We could lose fat and build muscle instantly! We could restore broken limbs! WE COULD HELP BALD MEN NOT BE BALD ANYMORE, IF THAT IS WHAT THEY WANTED. Plastic surgeons would be out of a job!
Utahraptor: Only for like one day a month!
T-Rex: Part of the research would be extending the effects 24/7!
T-Rex: It would be a utopia, Utahraptor! All we need is for one werewolf to be brave enough to let Science experiment on him, and then we can ALL get a little of the sweet blood fever!
Utahraptor: I thought that was vampires.
T-Rex: They should do it too.
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: [small] Hullo, T-Rex! I dressed up as a werewolf wearing a stethoscope to try to cheer you up!
T-Rex: Oh, Mr. Tusks! I should call the police. You're so cute it's illegal!
Off panel (punchline): [small] T-Rex I am also a vice mayor




T-Rex: I have come up with a game mod that will please everyone, even... THE DEVIL.
Devil: UNLIKELY
T-Rex: It's a mod for Grand Theft Autos!
Devil: ...PROCEED
T-Rex: It's like normal, but when you die you wake up in a hospital!
T-Rex: Only you're not just put out on the street again: you're in traction, unable to move. Critical condition. You can watch TV, during those moments when you're conscious. You can talk to your parents when they visit, try to explain why you did what you did. Why did you do these terrible things? You don't know.
T-Rex: Here's a hard truth: there's no button to understand the past.
Utahraptor: But what if you don't survive?
T-Rex: Then you wake up in hospital dead!
T-Rex: And you play as a friend or family member, staring at your body, wondering where it all went wrong. People can always surprise you, can't they? But that doesn't mean the surprises are going to be good ones.
Utahraptor: And then they can go outside and blow up cars?
T-Rex: Haha, YEP! It's so awesome.
T-Rex: Everyone's trying to grapple with these sprees, wondering if maybe folks ARE inherently awful, wondering if maybe one bad day is all that stands between them and the murderers they see on TV. You know this because you watch the same reports while in traction!
T-Rex (punchline): IT ALL WORKS




T-Rex: !
T-Rex: Guys! I just had a revelation about God! For serious!
T-Rex: God is all-knowing and all-seeing, right? So it follows - THROUGH LOGIC - that... that...
Dromiceiomimus: Yes?
T-Rex: That God has to be the biggest fanboy ever! Who knows more about every Star Trek episode than God? Who knows more about each and every comic, anime and manga series EVER CONCEIVED than God? He's like this ultimate obsessive fanboy nerd!
Utahraptor: He even knows everything about VIDEO GAMES, T-Rex.
T-Rex: *gasp* You're right!
T-Rex: He has encyclopaedic knowledge about every RPG, MMORPG, FPS, RTS, TBS, and IF game ever made!
Utahraptor: Hey. That was a lot of acronyms there.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: God, are you the biggest nerd?
God: T-REX ARE YOU THE SASSIEST DINOSAUR
T-Rex: Second-place in last month's Sassy-Assy Competition!
God: SEE
God (punchline): I KNEW THAT




Narrator: VALENTINE'S DAY EVE:
T-Rex: Okay, this time for sure! I will avoid any troubles on Valentine's Day by simply IGNORING IT. I will deny this manufactured holiday its very existence!
T-Rex: Have I, perhaps, solved the "Valentine's Day Problem" once and for all?
Dromiceiomimus: Aww! That's kind of sad, T-Rex. What if someone gives you a so-bad-they're-good valentine, like those little ones with pictures of cars that say things like "I wheelie like you"? Would you really want to turn those down?
T-Rex: Huh! I actually hadn't considered ironic valentines, which I do like. Hmm...
Utahraptor: And what if someone wants you to be their valentine for real?
T-Rex: Well...!
Utahraptor: Seriously! What happens if a gorgeous, intelligent, funny woman asks you to be her valentine tomorrow? Are you going to shoot her down because you're denying that Valentine's Day exists?
T-Rex: My friend, I will handle that situation by simply "ignoring my principles" and "reversing my position".
Narrator: ANYWAY, T-REX ENDS UP SPENDING VALENTINE'S DAY ALONE:
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Why do they call it "lactose intolerant"? They should call it, "lactose inconsiderate".




T-Rex: "Goosie the Goosy Goose"
T-Rex: Goosie was the goosiest goose who ever lived!
T-Rex: That is to say, any trait that applied to geese applied to her most of all. She was the most goose it was possible to be.
Dromiceiomimus: So if geese are loud, Goosie was the loudest?
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: And if geese are intelligent, Goosie was the intelligentest?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: And if geese have an average egg length of 8.3cm, Goosie's eggs were EVEN BIGGER??
T-Rex: Uh - I guess so?
Utahraptor: And if geese weigh 7 kg, Goosie was an even greater mass of muscle and beak??
T-Rex: Y-Yes?
Off panel: Well! Goosie sounds less like a goose and more like a UTAHRAPTOR to me. Which IS, arguably, the greatest instantiation of the idea of "goose"??
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): You're not wrong




T-Rex: Folks will occasionally publish a story in which a particularly conspicuous orthographic symbol is missing.
T-Rex: I know a handful of justifications for doing this!
T-Rex: It's fun to scout out any limits in your wording (artificial or not) and, in doing so, hit upon an additional, unfamiliar form of communication! And it's a joy to find that, with this unusual linguistic format now at your disposal, talking with this constraint is just as normal to you now as talking without it was!
Dromiceiomimus: It's tricky to sound natural, though.
T-Rex: No doubt!
Utahraptor: But do you actually obtain anything by talking in such a way?
T-Rex: Obviously!
T-Rex: You NOT ONLY gain faculty with odd word inclinations, if that is actually a faculty, but you also gain all sorts of skills: talking skills, thinking quickly skills, and, um... an opportunity to publish a dictionary for folks with similar fascinations?
Utahraptor: Huh.
Off panel: I still think it's not half as striking as if you didn't say a particular word for a bit - say, "frig"?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Do you truly ask that I dismiss my many plans for my tomb to proclaim "THIS MAN SAID 'FRIG' A LOT AND, YOU GUYS, IT WAS SO RAD"?
T-Rex (punchline): As I will NOT




Narrator: T-REX HAS DECIDED TO STALK SOMEONE:
T-Rex: I've decided to stalk a friend! Hah hah, why not? I will be the person they least suspect!
T-Rex: This is because I'm violating the understood limits of our friendship!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm going to let you in on a secret, okay? I have decided to stalk Utahraptor! Can you help me out?
Dromiceiomimus: I can, and I will! This is all in good fun, right?
T-Rex: RIGHT. We are NOT allowed to murder him.
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER:
Utahraptor: T-Rex, I think I've got a stalker!
T-Rex: Hee! That's too bad!
Utahraptor: Yeah, it's not actually that bad a deal yet. This guy just calls me and tells me he knows where I live, and I'm like, okay, and then he giggles and hangs up. I think he's new to this. Sometimes a woman calls too.
T-Rex: Hee hee!
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER: CONSEQUENCES!
T-Rex (punchline): Cheese it, the fuzz!




T-Rex: Getting to space is really expensive! You need to move our bodies PLUS the food to keep us alive up into orbit, and that's just to get to the bottom of space.
T-Rex: It goes up for a really long way after that!!
T-Rex: But nevertheless, we've DONE IT. We've travelled to the moon and back, proving that space travel is possible for us. But what if it were... easier? What if we didn't have to worry about food and water? What if we didn't have to worry about moving our bodies up there at all?
Dromiceiomimus: You're talking about sending robots?
T-Rex: No. BETTER. I'm talking about sending... GHOSTS.
Utahraptor: Because ghosts don't weigh anything and don't need food!
T-Rex: PRECISELY.
T-Rex: It took us until the 60s to reach space, because of our mortal bodies and how we can't fly on our own. And given how there should be around 15 ghosts for every living person - AND I HAVE DEFINITELY NOT SEEN FIFTEEN GHOSTS - the only logical explanation is this: they are all ALREADY in space.
Utahraptor: GASP
Banner: Ghosts come out at night, and it's always night in space
T-Rex: Don't @ me!
Banner (punchline): Don't @ me




T-Rex: Teens: you want to go viral, right? Yeah you do. You lie in bed all night thinking "what are these new feelings I have, what's happening with my changing body, and how do I go friggin' viral??" TEENS: I have the answer.
T-Rex: Put it in your will, teens!
T-Rex: Check it out: "Whomsoever, in the space of one week after the announcement of this contest, gets the most retweets of a tweet praising me, shall get all my mad riches". DONE. Before you know it, people will be seeing "[YOUR NAME HERE] rules, RT if you agree" EVERYWHERE.
T-Rex: It's what I'm gonna do, teens! Believe me: I am a former teen myself!!
Utahraptor: But then you'll be dead and won't be around to enjoy the praise!
T-Rex: Ah, but that's the best part!
T-Rex: YOU FAKE YOUR DEATH. Then you return, and since you're alive the contest is nullified! But then in a twist the disgruntled people realize that if they kill you the will would go into effect again, so they all try to kill you, and your life segues into Die Hard so slowly you barely even notice.
T-Rex (punchline): ATTENTION TEENS! LISTEN TO YOUR ELDERS, WE HAVE [tiny] ideas for things that would be amazing if they happened to someone else and also [end tiny] REALLY GOOD ADVICE!




T-Rex: You guys!
T-Rex: Let's assume the universe is deterministic!!
T-Rex: And if that's true we're no more responsible for our actions than a computer is for executing code. We have no choice in what happens to us, and if you set up the universe in the exact same way we'd make the same choices and the exact same things would happen. Free will is therefore an illusion! Like a computer, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS.
Utahraptor: Geez. Let's assume the universe is indeterministic then!
T-Rex: Even better!
T-Rex: Then things can happen randomly with no event responsible for causing them. And anything random (which includes every decision we make, unless you want them to be deterministic!) you can't be held responsible for, so therefore AGAIN we're not responsible for anything we do.
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: Anyway, LONG STORY SHORT:
T-Rex (punchline): I have it on good authority that somebody tooted just now but SADLY, we have no-one to blame




Devil: MMM GREETINGS T-REX I HAVE A QUERY OF A PERSONAL NATURE
T-Rex: Shoot!
Devil: DO YOU EVER EXPERIENCE
Devil: BODY IMAGE ISSUES
T-Rex: Hah! Bawdy image issues!
Devil: NO I MEAN LIKE DO YOU EVER WISH YOUR BODY LOOKED DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES
T-Rex: Well, actually, no, but I do empathise! I really like being a giant awesome dinosaur, but nobody's ever told me that being giant and awesome is undesirable. I guess SOMETIMES I've been frustrated by my stubby arms, but I still love the li'l champs!
Utahraptor: So you'd never wish to have anything changed?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: I guess I'm lucky! I can't imagine what it must be like to be transsexual, waking up in the morning and feeling like there's been some unfair mistake, and parts of your body are WRONG.
Utahraptor: I've sometimes wished I was more muscley, but that's nothing, because I could just work out if it was REALLY an issue.
T-Rex: The Devil, does that answer your question?
Devil: NO AND YOUR SYMPATHY IS AS USELESS AS THE BERRIES IN SUPER MARIO WORLD
Devil: BY WHICH I MEAN
Devil (punchline): ONLY GOOD FOR YOSHIS




T-Rex: Time for me to learn some new languages! AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, he who can speak many languages is suspected by his peers to be an ultra super genius times two.
T-Rex: Perhaps I will learn... SIGN LANGUAGE?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, you should, T-Rex! Then we could talk to each other!
T-Rex: You know sign language?
Dromiceiomimus: Yep! Well - I know Signed English, which is just English translated into hand signs. It's different from ASL, which is a true natural signed language with its own grammar!
T-Rex: Neat!
T-Rex: Then it's settled! I will learn sign language!
Utahraptor: And I will learn Zulu!
Utahraptor: I've always wanted to learn a language nobody around me speaks, and I like the way Zulu sounds.
T-Rex: Dude, maybe we're TRENDSETTERS! Maybe in 3 months languages less spoken will be the very CURRENCY of coolness, a shibboleth for entry into the rarefied world of ULTRA POPULARITY!
Off panel: That only works if we're ultra popular, but we're just two dudes who have decided in the past 60 seconds to learn some new languages for no real reason!
T-Rex (punchline): My question: WHAT COULD BE COOLER THAN THAT??




T-Rex: People who nearly die often report a clarity afterwards: after having faced their own mortality and survived, they have a new focus and drive in the world, and petty irrelevancies fall away!
T-Rex: As a guy who sometimes has trouble getting up in the morning, THIS SOUNDS GREAT.
T-Rex: Sign ME up for some clarity, please!! The catch is, of course, that I need to nearly die for it to happen. And it has to be a REAL near-death, otherwise I'll never undergo that life-altering change in perception available only to those who have survived the crucible or whatever.
T-Rex: Oh well!!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, you're having near-death experiences constantly!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: Maybe lying in bed a bit longer kept you from a traffic accident! Maybe napping in the shower prevented you from having the time to make breakfast, AND THEN CHOKING ON IT! The very fact you're here is a testament to how you've avoided these deaths! You're a walking, talking, best case scenario!!
Narrator: AND SO:
T-Rex: Yeah, but what if NOT eating this whole thing of ice cream is what kills me?! Riddle me that, DOCTOR.
Off panel: T-Rex
Off panel (punchline): This isn't what house calls are supposed to be




T-Rex: There's this crazy rash I've got on my wrist. This is an unwelcome development that I did not invite!
T-Rex: Forget you, crazy rash!
Dromiceiomimus: Have you done anything to try to get rid of it?
T-Rex: I am a firm believer in the "do nothing and your problems will take care of themselves" school of problem solving.
Dromiceiomimus: Really? Well - good luck!
Utahraptor: Has this technique ever solved ANY of your problems, T-Rex?
T-Rex: All the time!
T-Rex: Like this one time, I had to pay my phone bill, but it's sort of a pain to mail stuff, you know? So I just waited and waited and eventually a collections agency called ME, and they let me pay my bill over the phone!
Utahraptor: But there are conseq-
T-Rex: It was amazing!
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER THE RASH GETS WORSE:
T-Rex: ATTENTION, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS!!
T-Rex (punchline): Why don't you call?




Narrator: VISITING OLD FRIENDS COMICS
T-Rex: Hooray for visiting old friends!
T-Rex: Old friends are the best kind of friends because you still get along really well, even though you maybe haven't seen each other for a long time. It is a time for healthy nostalgia and for talking of tomorrow!
Dromiceiomimus: But current friends are good too, aren't they T-Rex?
T-Rex: Yes! My endorsement of old friends is not meant to be taken as a slight against friends currently in rotation.
Utahraptor: What do you like best about visiting old friends, T-Rex?
T-Rex: An excellent question!
T-Rex: I think what I like best is how you have the intimacy years of friendship provides, but also the perspective gained from any time spent apart. It lets you be honest with each other! You can see how everyone's changed and talk and laugh about it.
Utahraptor: That's great - BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS??
T-Rex: Aww! Well, I'll be their friend, unless there's a good reason why they don't have any friends, such as rampant murderism or incurable stealie-o-holicism.
Off panel: Neither of those are actual afflictions, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Then we're SET!




God: T-REX TODAY IS THE DAY FOR TOTAL EMOTIONAL HONESTY
T-Rex: Nopers!!
T-Rex: TODAY is the day of continuing to leave certain emotions unstated AND/OR ignored!
T-Rex: This is because total honesty has the power to DESTROY relationships! FOR EXAMPLE, Dromiceiomimus, if we're in a committed monogamous relationship, I don't want my friend or even a random dude coming up to you and saying how he loves you more than anything and how he could never admit it until now! I want him to suffer in silence. For the greater good!
Dromiceiomimus: Is he hot?
Utahraptor: You're privileging your happiness over his!
T-Rex: No! I'm just looking at TOTAL happiness.
T-Rex: My girlfriend and I are in love, and my friend and I are happy. This equals 15 happiness points, 10 for love and 5 for friendship.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: But if he confesses love to her, I'm now UNhappy with my friend, and we're down 5 HP! Forget THAT noise.
Off panel: I think you're just setting up this point system so that it supports you and your lady friend staying together!
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRLFRIEND
T-Rex: WHEN I GET ONE
T-Rex (punchline): HER NAME WILL BE "SAMANTHA"; IT IS A PRETTY NAME




Narrator: HOW TO USE TUMBLR
T-Rex: Tumblr is a cool social network because it lets people "reblog" your "posts" while also allowing them to "edit them so they can make you say whatever they want"!
T-Rex: So here's how you get started on Tumblr!
T-Rex: First, create an account. Tumblr will ask you to name your "blog". Cool blogs have names like "Pics O' Dogs", "OMG... Dog Pix?!" or "LOL, Just Dog Pics I Guess". Dumb blogs have names like "Breaking World News Conveyed Entirely Through Reaction Gifs".
T-Rex: Wait actually that's a cool blog too, nevermind, SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THAT
Utahraptor: What else can you do on Tumblr?
T-Rex: So much!
T-Rex: You can create photosets of your favourite tv show or movie, share text posts about your favourite tv show or movie, quote your -
Utahraptor: Sure, great, but does Tumblr have images of attractive male celebrities in attractive male situations?
T-Rex: Uh
Tumblr ad: tumblr.
Tumblr ad (punchline): yep, we’ve got pics of that.™




T-Rex: It's spring soon, Dromiceiomimus! And you know what that means!
T-Rex: BIKE RIDES
T-Rex: Oh man, are we going to RIDE THE HECK OUT OF OUR BIKES shortly?
Dromiceiomimus: We are going to RIDE OUR BIKES TO PIECES as soon as the weather permits, T-Rex!!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I am so happy that we live in a place and time that will soon permit bike rides!
Utahraptor: With ice cream?
T-Rex: With ice cream!!
T-Rex: We're going to bike down to the ice cream store and we're going to get ice cream and nobody's ice cream is going to fall into the dirt, I PROMISE. The near future is gonna be great, Utahraptor! Tomorrow's nothing but ice cream on wheels.
Utahraptor: NICE.
Narrator (punchline): THE END




T-Rex: Let's say you're playing chess with someone, and suddenly they have a fatal heart attack. This is the best possible way to win, you guys!
T-Rex: You have kicked their ass at chess SO HARD that they DIED.
T-Rex: It doesn't even matter if you were losing when they kicked the bucket: you've still won with the best finishing move possible! And what's more, your victory is SO AWESOME that it completely overshadows everything your opponent ever accomplished during his life! People will say "Sure, that guy may have CURED CANCER, but he lost so badly at chess that he died." EVERY VERSION OF HIS OBITUARY WILL END WITH "CHECKMATE".
Utahraptor: Every time we play chess, you're hoping that I'll die!!
T-Rex: I'm not!
T-Rex: Okay, I am. But it's a small hope!
Utahraptor: Yeah, a small hope that I'll be dead and gone and remembered as "The Guy Who Was So Upset When He Lost His Queen That His Heart Stopped Beating"!
T-Rex: Yes! Exactly!
T-Rex: I'm not a terrible person, Utahraptor! If you died playing chess I'd be sad, obviously! But also happy, because I KICKED YOUR ASS STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVE!
T-Rex (punchline): ...Let us pause here and remember how truth and honesty are the foundation of any social relationship?




T-Rex: Dinosaur Present Day, Featuring T-Rex, has been a complete success!
T-Rex: People even gave ME presents! It was awesome!
T-Rex: Thank you so much for the little gloves, Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Well thank YOU for the chocolates, T-Rex! They were very nice.
T-Rex: Nice chocolates for a nice lady!
Utahraptor: This holiday of yours seems to have spread a lot of goodwill!
T-Rex: Indeed!
Utahraptor: Wouldn't it be great if EVERY day could be Dinosaur Present Day?
T-Rex: Featuring T-Rex? That would be a lot of presents!
Utahraptor: Speaking of which: thanks for the portrait! It's a very good likeness.
T-Rex: Yeah man!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm giving a "thumbs up"!




T-Rex: I have a friendship crush on all my friends. They're great!
T-Rex: Hello, Dromiceiomimus! I have a friendship crush on you!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, thank you T-Rex. You're not so bad yourself.
T-Rex: A friendship crush is where you really like a friend, but it's not necessarily sexual, but everyone makes jokes that it's totally sexual, because you like to hang out all the time.
Dromiceiomimus: Got it!
Utahraptor: Do you have a friendship crush on me, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: But you're not supposed to ask. That makes you seem needy! It causes my friendship crush to fade a bit!
Utahraptor: Oh no!
T-Rex: But your regret is bringing it back. Revitalizing it! No - yes. Yes! The friendship crush is restored!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN ANOTHER COMIC:
T-Rex (punchline): S - Sapphists?




Narrator: THE TOP FIVE EMOTIONS
T-Rex: 1) Happiness!
T-Rex: 2) Happiness, but with just a touch of melancholia!
T-Rex: 3) Megahappiness!
Dromiceiomimus: Wait, why isn't that #1?
T-Rex: It's a sometimes treat. If megahappiness was as common as happiness, then we'd have to rename it to "happiness" and the original "happiness" would, according to the standard metric prefixes, become "microhappiness".
Dromiceiomimus: Fair enough!
T-Rex: 4) The feeling you get by putting your hands into a big bag of rice!
Utahraptor: Ooh, that one's solid!
T-Rex: 5) That last one but, with a non-Neutonian fluid instead.
Utahraptor: And that one's solid only under sufficient force! Well, buddy, your list is great and I have no criticisms for you. How about you and I both enjoy some Emotion #1 right now?
Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: Oh no! I got a bit of Emotion #2 in me too!!
T-Rex (punchline): *LONG, DRAMATIC SIGH*




T-Rex: One day John Spidderman was leaving work when he took a look overhead and saw Spider-Man swinging by from a thread.
T-Rex: "Dang, that guy is ruining my name," he muttered to himself.
T-Rex: John Spidderman didn't know what to do. Now even some of his long-time friends caught themselves mispronouncing his name by accident, calling him "Spy-derman" instead of the "Spidd-erman" he'd been since he was born. "I guess I have to... KILL SPIDER-MAN??" he said, but only to himself, so that if he did it nobody would suspect him.
Dromiceiomimus: And did he?
T-Rex: He did not!
T-Rex: It's a big leap from not liking a guy to MURDERING him; it was just an idle fantasy on his part.
Utahraptor: Ah.
T-Rex: Instead he worked to be the best person he could be, which is all any of us can do, and over time he managed to let go of some of his resentment!
Utahraptor: Oh. I was hoping they'd fight each other.
T-Rex: NOPE
Narrator: THIS HAS BEEN
Narrator: "REALISTIC TALES OF INTROSPECTION"
Narrator (punchline): THE ONLY COMIC WRITTEN BY AND FOR INTROVERTS




T-Rex: "Excuse me T-Rex, but which toothbrush do you think is yours?"
Narrator: SENTENCES THAT ARE NEVER GOOD TO HEAR
T-Rex: Another good one's "What time is it? Looks like it's MURDER O'CLOCK."
Dromiceiomimus: What if they were about to murder a really terrible person though?
T-Rex: Even if that's true, it's never good to hear that bad a line. Instead, they should say "I've gotta stop by the bank real quick to make a deposit... OF MURDER".
T-Rex: ...Wait somehow that got worse, wait -
Utahraptor: "It's not you, it's me."
T-Rex: What if that puts you on the course to a better relationship?
Utahraptor: "The food you gobbled was poisoned"?
T-Rex: Yeah. Yeah, I suppose that's never good to hear. UNLESS... you've altered your DNA to be immune to it, and today's the day of your big test. And it turns out you're now immune to ALL toxins, and this is but the first of your many new superpowers to manifest!
T-Rex: You stare at your fists as razor-sharp blades push out from between your fingers. Somehow, it only tickles. Somehow, you know life just got crazy sweet. SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW CRIMINALS WILL RUE THIS DAY.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): Scientists need to invent a way to make DNA work like in cartoons




T-Rex: Hey! Hey Utahraptor! Do - do you think that some guys go to liquor stores to pick up chicks because they know everyone there is over 18?
T-Rex: Or at least -
T-Rex: - willing to pretend?
Dromiceiomimus: Hah! Aw! That's terrible, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, what are YOU doing here? I thought it was Just The Guys!
Dromiceiomimus: It seems that, once again, I have become privy to guy talk due to conversational negligence!!
T-Rex: Disaster!
Narrator: EARLIER:
T-Rex: So personally, Dromiceiomimus, I feel that -
Utahraptor: Hey, where is she?
T-Rex: Whoah, Utahraptor! I thought that DROMICEIOMIMUS was behind me!
Utahraptor: Nope! Just me, your male friend Utahraptor! Were you about to have a conversation about feelings?
T-Rex: NO. NO I WASN'T.
Banner: "SOME PEOPLE TREAT THEIR GENDERED FRIENDS DIFFERENTLY"
T-Rex: Incidentally, I don't have any friends who aren't gendered!
Banner (punchline): OKAY




T-Rex: Time to go on a wacky adventure, which would be quite amazing to an imaginary third party with the ability to see my actions rendered as a continuous narrative!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Whew!!
T-Rex: Kick ass!
T-Rex: Well, that was pretty much the best adventure ever! Do you recall when we got trapped in that mine that was filling up with water very quickly?
Dromiceiomimus: I do! And our escape...!
T-Rex: Yes, it was quite amazing!
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Congratulations on publishing a book of your story, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Thanks!
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Congratulations on your book becoming the entire world's Global Narrative and Shared History, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It was unexpected but gratifying!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So!
T-Rex (punchline): What's left?




T-Rex: Oh, it's true! If it was even MARGINALLY in style, I would grow mutton chops.
Narrator: TRUE CONFESSIONS OF T-REX
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, T-Rex, you'd be one of those guys with deliberate facial hair?
T-Rex: In a second! I love the grizzled prospector look. Actually, no, that's not even true - I love PRETENDING to be a grizzled prospector. The facial hair would just be the grizzly icing on the prospector cake!
Utahraptor: I really don't think it would be that fetching a look on you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: That's okay! I have backup plans.
T-Rex: Backup plan "A" is labelled "handlebar moustache"!
Utahraptor: You really wish you were a hairy guy born a hundred years ago, don't you?
T-Rex: Sometimes I do! I wonder what it'd be like.
God: DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW T-REX BECAUSE I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
T-Rex: Really?
God (punchline): YEAH BASICALLY YOU DIE OF SYPHILIS AT 30 BUT YOU LEAVE THIS TOTALLY HAIRY CORPSE




T-Rex: Who here wants to learn a new language by breakfast? Any takers? ...No?
T-Rex: What if I told you it was the LANGUAGE OF THE SEA??
Dromiceiomimus: Ah yes, seaspeak, otherwise known as the Standard Marine Communication Phrases! A set of simple English words and phrases, designed to facilitate communication on the open seas between speakers of disparate languages, where otherwise it might be difficult or impossible!
T-Rex: You - you know it?
Dromiceiomimus: Answer; yes. Over.
Utahraptor: So what's the language like?
T-Rex: Man, you should be talking to Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: But, it's this tiny super-simplified phrase-focused English. And there's only one way to say each thing! There's no "I dunno dude", just "No information." And if you've got a mysterious problem on the open sea, you know how you say that? "I have problems."
Utahraptor: Adorable!
T-Rex: I KNOW! I feel like, thanks to "I have problems", I have unintentionally spoken the language of the sea many a time.
T-Rex (punchline): Yarrrr.




Narrator: THE LIFECYCLE OF COOL
Narrator: BIRTH:
T-Rex: Personally, I think it's cool to say "pooty poot"!
Narrator: GROWTH:
T-Rex: Wow, EVERYONE thinks it's cool to say "pooty poot"!
Narrator: OVERGROWTH:
T-Rex: My mom said "pooty poot" to me, and she didn't even use it correctly. Parents are THE WORST at slang! PARTICULARLY at slang that's unfamiliar to them but they make the attempt anyway because they want to reconnect with their children, who were so happy when they were younger but who now seem to be turning into distant, sullen strangers.
T-Rex: GOD.
Narrator: PRECIPITOUS DECLINE:
Utahraptor: My aunt forwarded "Lol, Jesus memes! Funny but respectful!!" and added "pooty poot (;".
T-Rex: THE WORST
Narrator: IRONY:
Utahraptor: And may I just say... "pooty poot"?
T-Rex and Utahraptor: Hah hah hah hah!
T-Rex: People from three weeks ago were IDIOTS.
Narrator: NOSTALGIA COMEBACK:
Off panel: Does anyone else remember... POOTY POOT??
T-Rex: OH MY GOD, THAT REMINDS ME OF A MONTH AGO!! LIKE IF YOU AGREE!
T-Rex (punchline): SHARE IF YOU WILL NEVER STOP POOTY POOTING




T-Rex: Riddles! Everyone loves riddles, and I HAVE GOT A RIDDLE FOR YOU. Vin Diesel was walking down the street and found $50. Instead of taking it, he went into town and stole a fish! What the hell?
T-Rex: ANSWER: Vin Diesel is a cat!
Dromiceiomimus: Wait. Why was Vin Diesel involved again?
T-Rex: Maybe you'll like this one better! Vin Diesel is pushing his car when he stopped outside a hotel and immediately went bankrupt. What the hell??
Dromiceiomimus: Vin Diesel -
T-Rex: Correct! Vin Diesel is a cat who has learned to play Monopoly.
Utahraptor: Here's one for you, T-Rex! A beautiful human woman has sex with Vin Diesel.
T-Rex: Interesting!
Utahraptor: Now she's going to jail!
T-Rex: Oh man what the hell?? Is Vin Diesel a cat?
Utahraptor: Correct!
T-Rex: OH MY GOD, THAT'S SUCH A GOOD RIDDLE!
T-Rex: Vin Diesel ate a spider and then threw up on my living room floor! What the hell??
T-Rex (punchline): Cat and riddle time is OVER; this is an actual life challenge I must wrestle with




T-Rex: Utahraptor is afraid of ghosts!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah! Spoooooky!
T-Rex: Utahraptor is afraid of ghosts and his favourite song is "The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers.
Dromiceiomimus: I never knew that about him!
T-Rex: It's true! He also bakes way too many cookies whenever he's baking treats and then when he's done he freezes the extras for later.
Utahraptor: I don't do any of those things!
T-Rex: Sure you do!
T-Rex: But allow me to distract you with some facts about Dromiceiomimus: she really likes all kinds of boats. AND, and, she's afraid of heights sometimes!
Utahraptor: Hah hah! Really?
T-Rex: Yep!
God: ZERO OF THESE FACTS ARE TRUE T-REX
T-Rex: I am making life interesting! Also, did you know the Devil likes grape juice from concentrate?
God: HAH HAH
God (punchline): MAN HE PROBABLY DOES EH




T-Rex: If I get married, we have to play "Earth Angel" as the first dance, okay?
T-Rex: You guys! It'll be amazing!!
Dromiceiomimus: That's that climactic slow dance from Back to the Future, right? Why do you like it?
T-Rex: Oh! It's - romantic? I, um - I like how he says he will love the eponymous earth angel forever and ALSO ever more.
Dromiceiomimus: And what if "Johnny B. Goode" was played as the next song?
T-Rex: THAT would be entirely awesome!
Utahraptor: Hah! You don't want to get married. You want to go to a dance played by Marty McFly!
T-Rex: Man, whatever!
T-Rex: I've been to like two weddings in my life, but I've seen them portrayed in media thousands of times! Is it SO WRONG to incorporate elements of these media portrayals into my own expectations??
Utahraptor: I guess not, except for the fact that the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance is a HIGH SCHOOL BALL and not a wedding!
T-Rex: Hello?? Marty's parents share a relationship-making kiss at that dance! The parallels are TOTALLY OBVIOUS.
T-Rex (punchline): I'll say it again: if I had one wish, it'd be "Tell me how long it's going to take until everyone realizes they should never argue with me about Back to the Future".




Narrator: COMICS FOR HETEROSEXUAL CHICKS AND TOTALLY GAY DUDES!
Narrator: today's comic
Narrator: HOW TO GET A MAN TO LIKE YOU
T-Rex: Okay heterosexual chicks and totally gay dudes! Getting a man to like you is TRIVIAL.
T-Rex: Have you tried sexing him up?
Narrator: THE END
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's terrible!
T-Rex: Hee hee!
T-Rex: What's terrible? I'm just propogating the stereotype that all men want is sex and that if you want to attract one, then you should have sex with him as soon as possible, and he'll be yours for as long as you keep trading sex for intimac-
T-Rex: Wait, that is terrible.
Utahraptor: Uh-huh!
T-Rex: ATTENTION, all heterosexual chicks and gay dudes! Don't listen to me!
Multiple off-panel voices: It's too late, T-Rex! We're going to have sex with men RIGHT NOW!!
T-Rex (punchline): SERIOUSLY??




T-Rex: Okay, so, if the universe is full of mediocre aliens, how come they haven't contacted us yet? Could their answer perhaps be...
T-Rex: ...THEIR CRIPPLING ANXIETY OVER HOW MEDIOCRE THEY ARE??
T-Rex: Perhaps the universe is full of aliens, all assuming everyone ELSE is cooler than they are, all paralyzed by the fear they'll say the wrong thing and finally reveal themselves to be total losers! A whole universe of alien wallflowers, a galactic population that's spent 6 billion years writing out messages of friendship to broadcast to other worlds, only to erase them at the last minute while calling themselves stupid!!
Utahraptor: But WE'VE sent messages to the stars.
T-Rex: So WE must be the cool ones!
T-Rex: We're the ONLY PLANET in the VISIBLE UNIVERSE that has defeated its social anxiety. And that's why we haven't gotten responses! We're like the hot guy with the neat pecs that nobody asks to the dance because they all assume someone ELSE asked! They assume we're taken on account of how neat our pecs are!!
T-Rex (punchline): Yo, check 'em out




T-Rex: I love it when you play chess and you get to say something like "mate in 3". I'm using the rhetorical "you" there, of course!
T-Rex: I'm real bad at chess!!
T-Rex: But it's so KICK-ASS AWESOME to be able to sit there and say to your opponent "You may not see it yet, but no matter what you do, and EVEN IF you play optimally, I can force you to lose in the next 3 moves". Damn. I'm getting excited just thinking about it.
Dromiceiomimus: What if instead of "mate in 3", it was "mate in 4"?
T-Rex: FRIG, THAT'S EVEN BETTER!
Utahraptor: What about mate in... 10?
T-Rex: AAHH SO GREAT!
T-Rex: Imagine the confidence of seeing 10 moves ahead, and knowing that you've ALREADY WON. Then a quiet little "mate in 10" to let your opponent know they're playing - AND HAVE ALREADY LOST - against a SUPER GENIUS. Hot damn, dude. Mate in 10.
Narrator: LATER T-REX DISCOVERS THERE'S A "MATE IN 546" BOARD SETUP WHICH FORCES A CHECKMATE IN 546 MOVES NO MATTER WHAT THE OPPONENT DOES:
T-Rex: DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
Narrator (punchline): THAT WAS GONNA BE A REALLY LONG "DAAAAMN" BUT HIS MIND EXPLODED




T-Rex: So it turns out there's this "space treaty" that all these nations signed, saying none of them would ever claim ownership over moons or other planets. They've declared celestial bodies as common heritage for all sentient species!
T-Rex: Good for you, nations!
T-Rex: I didn't sign that treaty, nations!!
Dromiceiomimus: HOLLA
Utahraptor: But you're a citizen of a nation that signed it!
T-Rex: Possibly? I GUESS??
Utahraptor: My point is: if for some reason a nation took an ownership claim of yours seriously, they'd have a valid way to pressure your government to make you fall in line! You could go to jail.
T-Rex: I could cause an INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT??
Utahraptor: Yes but that's not necessarily a good thi-
Narrator: THIRTY SECONDS LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, government? This is T-Rex on speakerphone. I hereby claim ownership to ALL the other planets! You can look at them with telescopes if you want.
Off panel: Sir, this is Burger King, home of the Whopper.
T-Rex (punchline): ...Go on




T-Rex: Relationships! Sometimes they are hard, but NOT if you have a great captain for the ol' SS Relationship!
T-Rex: And he or she has a great crew!
T-Rex: And the crew has been trained by the best sailing minds of their generation, and each therefore braces themselves to their duty with the maximum of professional skill possible; always learning, improving themselves AND their sailing.
Dromiceiomimus: And yet even so, a successful journey depends on the winds, and the weather, and on getting lucky with storms.
T-Rex: R-
T-Rex: Right.
Utahraptor: Oh man, your metaphor fell apart there huh?
T-Rex: It didn't!
Utahraptor: It totally did! You were all "what if a relationship is like a real ship" but then Dromiceiomimus was like, "Even the greatest ship crewed by legends can find itself wrecked on the shoals of an unfriendly shore."
T-Rex: FINE. Relationships, like metaphors, are REALLY HARD to get right.
Off panel: And sometimes at the start of a new relationship/metaphor, the sex is really exciting and awesome!
T-Rex: Oh my god, are you actually getting sex for metaphors??
T-Rex (punchline): Because, if so, I am willing to put WAY more effort into my metaphors




Narrator: COMICS IN WHICH MATTERS TAKE A SUDDEN TURN FOR THE WORSE
T-Rex: Well, I'm perfectly content!
T-Rex: Yes indeed, life is good!
T-Rex: Wait - what's this?
T-Rex: A growth on my leg?
Narrator: THE END
Narrator: COMICS IN WHICH THE DEAD COME BACK TO LIFE TO HARASS THE LIVING
T-Rex: Run away!
Utahraptor: Run away!
T-Rex: Wait - what are we running from?
Utahraptor: Remember? The dead have come back and are harassing the living! They want to eat our brains!
T-Rex (punchline): Shit, no!




T-Rex: Time to talk about everyone's favourite topic...
T-Rex: Relationships!
T-Rex: Have you ever found yourself in a relationship that required at least a few sentences to explain what was going on, that couldn't be summed up in a single word like "boyfriend" or "ex-girlfriend"?
Dromiceiomimus: Well, actually, the thing you and I have is sort of -
T-Rex: Exactly! I'm glad you understand, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: So what about relationships that can't be summarized in one word?
T-Rex: Um.
T-Rex: They're... pretty okay?
Utahraptor: They're "pretty okay".
T-Rex: Okay, honestly, I wanted to talk more about how deep and important some friendships can be, but we've somehow moved away from that.
T-Rex (punchline): I have no-one to blame but myself!




T-Rex: Who wants to party? Because THIS GUY is totally ready to party.
T-Rex: I am this guy, in case that wasn't clear!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, I'd love to party with you, T-Rex, but I'm actually on my way in to work.
T-Rex: Well I'd love to party with YOU, Dromiceiomimus, but you're making that REALLY HARD. I don't even know if your work lets friends party there!!
Utahraptor: Her work probably doesn't let friends party there.
T-Rex: ...Yeah.
T-Rex: But you're down to party, right? Ol' Utahraptor, "always down to party"!
Utahraptor: Not today! I've got to run some errands.
T-Rex: Oh.
T-Rex: Okay.
Narrator: LATER: A PARTY OF ONE!
T-Rex: Otherwise known as "eating chips alone on the couch".
T-Rex (punchline): Otherwise known as NO REGRETS, BITCHES!!




T-Rex: Everyone! Abandon your old religion, because I've got a way cooler one! It guarantees that when you die you get to hang out with dogs!
T-Rex: NO OTHER COMPETING RELIGION CAN MAKE THIS CLAIM.
T-Rex: In fact, several religions claim THEIR afterlife is only open to TRUE BELIEVERS who go to church, which animals do RARELY at best!! Check and mate!
Dromiceiomimus: True, but several religions also permit reincarnation, INCLUDING as "lesser animals". Sure, YOUR religion lets you chill with dogs, but others let you ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE DOGNESS. I know what I'D prefer!
T-Rex: Oh crap, I hadn't thought of that!!
Utahraptor: It's an afterlife arms race!
T-Rex: Frig, man, I need to top this. But what's better than being a dog?
Utahraptor: Don't ask me! I'm not the dude who, for unclear reasons, is trying to start a religion!!
T-Rex: I'VE GOT IT! All I need is a passer by, and...
T-Rex: Excuse me, ma'am! Wouldn't you prefer a religion that offers YOUR CHOICE of coming back as a dog, hanging out with dogs, or becoming a liquid metal robot and going back in time to assassinate history's greatest villains and/or villainous dogs?
Off panel (punchline): FRIG YES




T-Rex: Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!
T-Rex: There's water in the basement and I don't know what to do!
T-Rex: If the basement keeps on flooding, then I'll certainly be blue!
T-Rex: The water heater's leaking and my showers are all cold!
T-Rex: I wouldn't mind so much, but it makes me feel so old!
Utahraptor: Oooh, boo on the last line of your song, my friend!
T-Rex: Boo?
Utahraptor: Yeah! The story was holding together pretty well until you got to that point, but cold showers make you feel old? Not really! They wake you up, mostly.
Utahraptor: On the other hand, I thought "feeling blue" tied into the water theme well!
T-Rex: Thanks for your thoughts!
Off panel: Hey, anytime!
Narrator (punchline): "Best friends forever"




T-Rex: Man, Dromiceiomimus has been looking fantastic lately! I would DEFINITELY rate her current attractiveness as AT LEAST a nine point five on ten!!
T-Rex: I -
[no text]
Utahraptor: Hah! That's what you get for thinking out loud, my friend!
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: I should've went with it when I saw her; stopping in mid-sentence just admits guilt. I should've said, "That's right, Dromiceiomimus! YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING GREAT LATELY."
Utahraptor: Except you didn't rate her a perfect ten.
T-Rex: Only because I always reserve point five for emergencies!!
Narrator: A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF AN EMERGENCY:
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you're a perfect 9.5 on 10!
Off panel: But what if I... dressed up like a flapper and said "Here's the news?"
T-Rex (punchline): That's a perfect ten and luckily I reserved some extra points for this scenario, listen, I gotta go lie down




T-Rex: Banks are often robbed for the small amount of cash in the till, and often these tiny heists in which nobody is injured don't make the news and are left unsolved! Crime doesn't pay?
T-Rex: APPARENTLY CRIME PAYS A REASONABLE AMOUNT SOMETIMES??
T-Rex: This means that there are way more bank robbers out there than I initially imagined! And the smart ones would be happy with their successful crime and new check mark on their awesome things bucket list and leave it at that. I like to think that I have only smart friends, DROMICEIOMIMUS.
Dromiceiomimus: Um
T-Rex: VERY SMART FRIENDS, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: You think Dromiceiomimus is a bank robber?
T-Rex: Hah! Like you're not one too!!
T-Rex: Look man, I know that there's no proof. But that's the thing: if I'm right, there wouldn't be any! And yeah you're robbing banks, but that means you're robbing obscenely rich corporations who think a stupid chequing account should cost $20 a month, plus their website sucks too!
T-Rex: Huh.
T-Rex (punchline): ...Teach me your secrets?




T-Rex: You know what's a fake idea? DESTINY IS A FAKE IDEA.
T-Rex: And heeeeeere's why!
T-Rex: Let's say you're destined to become a great filmmaker, but you're born in 1475. Oh dang, sorry! FILMIC ART DOESN'T EXIST YET! Sorry about your fate, bro!
Dromiceiomimus: Well wouldn't your destiny then to be a great, I don't know, chimney-sweep or something?
Dromiceiomimus: [small] It's my understanding that past chimneys were kept well-swept on the regular
Utahraptor: Seems to me like "destiny" is just applying supernatural motivations to what happened anyway!
T-Rex: YES.
T-Rex: Claiming you have a DESTINY supposes the universe has a preferred shape AND that there's a force plotting out storylines, but that it isn't quiiiite strong enough to always ensure they happen.
Utahraptor: Lot of big assumptions to make just so you can make some dang movies!!
T-Rex: This is how come instead of saying "it's my destiny to" I just say "I would really prefer it if in this chaotic multiverse, the parallel timeline my consciousness inhabits is the one in which I"!
T-Rex (punchline): It's a little thing called "SCIENCE", babies??




Image description: The transcript reads the panels normally, left-to-right, but this particular comic should be read right-to-left: panels 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4
T-Rex: If you started reading manga left-to-right, then you'd better keep that a secret, otherwise everyone will know you're bad at mangas! If that was happening AS WE SPEAK I'd recommend you start again with the right-most panel, right about... NOW.
T-Rex: AND WE CAN ALL JUST DEAL WITH IT
T-Rex: Comics are old hat, but you know what's new and exciting?!
Dromiceiomimus: Manga?
T-Rex: Manga, yes! Incredible that you guessed that, by the way. Anyway MANGA is from Japan and in Japanese you can read right-to-left so that's what you do in manga too!
T-Rex: "Someone had stuffed the corpse with mangas. But he wasn't a corpse when they started."
Utahraptor: T-Rex?
T-Rex: LET'S NEVER READ MANGAS AGAIN
T-Rex: "Mangas" is totally acceptable! Check it out: "I drew the scalpel across my belly, mangas sloshing out onto the floor, wet and heavy." "As I opened my mouth to scream, mangas spewed out in an uncontrollable bloody torrent."
Utahraptor: What the heck?!
T-Rex: I don't know where this is coming from! I need to go home!!
Off panel: Nobody likes it when you say "mangas", T-Rex!
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Get over here!
Off panel (punchline): Okay




T-Rex: I like the song "Kokomo" by the Beach Boys in which the listener is memorably advised to "[go] down to Kokomo, [where] we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow"!
God: IT'S NOT A REAL PLACE T-REX
T-Rex: Say
T-Rex: whaaaaaat??
God: THEY SAY IT'S "OFF THE FLORIDA KEYS" IN THIS REAL HIGH-PITCHED VOICE BUT I DISTINCTLY RECALL NOT PUTTING AN ISLAND NAMED "KOKOMO" THERE
God: YOU KNOW
God: BACK WHEN I WAS INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNING THE PLACE
T-Rex: But - why would the Beach Boys sing of LIES??
Utahraptor: They also claim to "defy a little bit of gravity" in the song!
T-Rex: THAT TOO IS IMPOSSIBLE!
T-Rex: Frig man. FRIG. I kinda suspected learning physics from 80s pop songs was a bad idea, but I was sure GEOGRAPHY was safe!
Utahraptor: There's bars called "Kokomo" there NOW, so maybe it's... prescient?
T-Rex: Wait: they WILLED a place into existence through SONG? Badass!!
Narrator: AND SO:
T-Rex: ♪♫ Ooh why don't we go down to Kokomo 2 / We'll get there fast and be given free revenue / And also they give you unlimited drinks too / Down in Kokomo 2 ♪♫
T-Rex (punchline): ♪♫ If the place does not meet these criteria then it's not the real Kokomo 2 ♪♫




T-Rex: It turns out horses aren't the only inspiration English uses for its idioms. We also use... doors?
T-Rex: OPPORTUNITY knocks on doors, you guys!
T-Rex: And when Opportunity closes a door, it also opens another. Sometimes, SOMETIMES, it opens a window.
Dromiceiomimus: These could be classified equally well as "idioms involving abstract concepts somehow granted agency".
T-Rex: Ooh! Like when Fortune favours the bold! Or when an ounce of Prevention is better than a pound of Cure!
Utahraptor: ...Gross.
T-Rex: Yeah, that's - that turned out gross.
Utahraptor: Anyway! I think all we can conclude is that folks talk about the things around them, and horses were around us for a really long time. And THAT suggests that millions of years from now, there'll be lots of aphorisms about transporters, spacebots and cyberdroids!
T-Rex: AWESOME
T-Rex: I CAN'T WAIT
Narrator: MILLIONS OF YEARS LATER:
Off panel: Attention patrons:
Off panel (punchline): Our paleontology exhibit closes in five minutes




T-Rex: Everyone needs a bio on Twitter Dot Com Slash Your Twitter Name! Well, everyone who signed up for Twitter.
T-Rex: Look.
T-Rex: You brought this problem on yourself.
T-Rex: Okay, so let's say your Twitter bio is "I'm fun and have cool interests! :) :D :o ;I"
T-Rex: We gotta punch this up: tell us your cool interests!
Dromiceiomimus: "I like eating, drinking, and music"?
T-Rex: NICE. But we need more sentences and adjectives. Try passionate, lifelong, incurable, freelance, unashamed, or diehard. And add guru, ninja, junkie, trailblazer, creator, AND/OR evangelist after those dang verbs!
Utahraptor: "Incurable eating trailblazer. Unashamed drinking evangelist. Diehard freelance music ninja."
T-Rex: EVEN NICER!
T-Rex: Now we just gotta spike it with some vaguely appealing single-word sentences. "Explorer. Romantic. Inventor. Eccentric." And you're done! You've got a Twitter bio to be "proud" of.
Utahraptor: Did you put "proud" in air quotes?
T-Rex: Hah! What a question!!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: T-Rex, your Twitter bio just says "Sexy in that trashy way. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah you do. You know. Shut up, you do."
T-Rex (punchline): YEAH I'M OPERATING ON AN ADVANCED LEVEL HERE, THANKS




T-Rex: Okay, so here's the plan! I send cards to all my friends giving them the first clue on a treasure hunt!
T-Rex: Then, they go on the treasure hunt!
T-Rex: Each clue leads them to a further clue in a new location, sending them on an across-town adventure!
T-Rex: The final clue leads them to my house, where they find not only a party with potato chips and barbequed corn, but also the moral that the REAL treasure is friendship!
T-Rex: (I like all my parties to have morals at the end!)
T-Rex: Oh boy, this treasure hunt which I have just explained in detail including the twist at the end will be great!
Utahraptor: Agreed!
Utahraptor: And since the Dromiceiomimus and I already know what's going on, we can help! We should make it a block party, and invite everyone!
T-Rex: Yeah, like in the fifties! Everybody was neighbourly in the fifties!
T-Rex: And all the men wore hats while the women baked pies! Sure, we had the stability we craved after the turmoil of WWII, but -
T-Rex (punchline): - at what cost? Repression both sexual and sociological left lasting scars, leading in many ways to the cultural self-doubt of the 60s but who cares, we've got to plan this party!




T-Rex: One day Danny, who was a ZOMBIE GHOST, decided to -
Off panel: NOPE!
Off panel: Hallowe'en is over, T-Rex!
T-Rex: DROMICEIOMIMUS!
T-Rex: You're throwing your voice much more than usual.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm sorry, but I have to draw the line here. Hallowe'en has been suffering inflation for years, with spooky skeleton decorations now coming out on October FIRST. THAT'S FULLY ONE MONTH EARLY! Current projections put us at CHRISTMAS levels of inflation in under a decade!
Utahraptor: And it's not like Christmas has stopped expanding either!
T-Rex: No?
Utahraptor: T-Rex, there's Christmas stores that are open ALL YEAR ROUND. December's already been lost to the holiday, and November's barely hanging on. These two holidays are on a collision course, and when they meet - well, even our best holiday scientists don't dare predict what will happen.
Off panel: Our less-best holiday scientists, however, are eager to predict they'll merge into a six-month holiday called "DEATHMAS".
T-Rex: OH MY GOSH!!
T-Rex (punchline): IS IT TOO EARLY TO SAY THEIR OPINIONS SEEM VERY CORRECT




T-Rex: Okay I just wanna say before we start that I'm NOT mad, Dromiceiomimus. Okay? I'm not mad at all. I'm actually really calm.
T-Rex: Honestly! I just want to hear the truth!
T-Rex: So when I ask you this question I hope you'll answer truthfully: you wanna hang out tonight?
Dromiceiomimus: ...uh, yes?
T-Rex: Okay, awesome! I'll drop you a line later. Maybe we can see a movie!
Utahraptor: What was that all about, dude?
T-Rex: I scheduled the sweet hangs!
T-Rex: AND I prefaced it by reassuring my listener that I wasn't mad, just in case they were worried. "Oh phew, he's in a good place," they could say. "His emotions are cool right now."
Utahraptor: T-Rex -
T-Rex: It's a little thing called "politeness"; look it up?
T-Rex: And that was a little thing called "sarcasm"; look that up as well? And then let's brainstorm a list of rhetorical techniques and we'll go over them together??
T-Rex (punchline): And actually I think that sounds really nice??




T-Rex: I think I have sex addiction, but like, for food!
T-Rex: Oh my gosh it's so freeing to finally say this out loud.
T-Rex: I wanna eat food like three times a day!!
T-Rex: And I wanna eat it at home and sometimes I wanna go out and eat it in public and I DON'T CARE IF ANYONE SEES ME. In fact, if I know the person watching me, I usually invite them to join in!
Dromiceiomimus: Do you want to eat food... in front of your family?
T-Rex: I won't lie! I've done it!!
Utahraptor: Have you ever... PAID for food?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
T-Rex: When I'm in a relationship sometimes my sweetie and I make food together, but often I'll have to go out and pay for it. Or sometimes I'll just take care of it myself. There's no shame in that!
Utahraptor: I'm not saying there is!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, sometimes I think about food EVEN WHILE EATING OTHER FOODS.
T-Rex: Fancier foods, you know? Or foods that my partner is unwilling or unable to cook for me. I buy food magazines to read about things I haven't tried yet. I -
T-Rex (punchline): I catch myself downloading food pictures when I'm supposed to be working




T-Rex: Dudes! It's time to impress my friends with my EXPANSIVE VOCABULARY!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Okay, shoot, I know I had something planned here. What word was I going to use? S-... "Standard"?
Dromiceiomimus: "Standard" is the word you were going to impress us with? "Standard".
T-Rex: I - maybe?
Utahraptor: I would've at least added some suffixes!
T-Rex: Standard-tastic?
Utahraptor: "Standard-tastic". No, real words, like "standardized". You know? Or "restandardizational". "DiDODECArestandardizational"! Now we're moving into the realm of me being impressed: 11 syllables! BUT DUE TO YOUR STUMBLES, I'M ONLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF!!
T-Rex: That's not a real word.
Off panel: Didodecarestandardizational: something referring to or about the restandardization process in a way that is related to 2 groupings of 12.
T-Rex: Okay but the first time actually someone uses that word the world will end!
Off panel (punchline): I KNEW THE RISKS




T-Rex: Worried about a date you're going on? Lick a dog poop! You'll have bigger things to worry about, like "holy crap why did I lick a dog poop just before my date??"
T-Rex: Problems with the tax man? Try licking a dog poop!
T-Rex: There's no problem that couldn't be made worse by licking a dog poop, which means that minor problems will disappear like a candle on the surface of the sun!!
T-Rex: (The candle is your existing problems, and the blinding light of the solar furnace is the problems you made by licking dog poops on the regular.)
Dromiceiomimus: Ah.
Utahraptor: But this doesn't solve anything. It just creates WORSE problems!
T-Rex: Sure!
T-Rex: Way worse problems... that can EASILY BE SOLVED by not lickin' poops no more. OH DAMN, NOW YOUR OLD PROBLEMS SEEM SMALL AND EASILY SOLVED!!
T-Rex: YOU'RE WELCOME!
T-Rex's head: *pop*
T-Rex (punchline): Ah yes, the distinctive "pop" sound of enlightenment, I know it well




T-Rex: Hey, the 90s called! They didn't leave a message.
T-Rex: They keep calling, you should probably call them back dude!
Dromiceiomimus: Hey, the 90s called!
T-Rex: Oh?
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, and all I could hear on the line was heavy breathing and giggling.
Dromiceiomimus: Your friends are losers, tell them to stop bothering me!
Utahraptor: Hey, the 90s called and left a callback number and I called it and now I've got the 90s on the line.
T-Rex: WHAT
T-Rex: What is happening
T-Rex (punchline): Tell them I wanna talk to my grandpa




T-Rex: There are a lot of problems in the world! Someone ought to do something.
T-Rex: Wait a second!
T-Rex: I'M someone!!
T-Rex: Okay Dromiceiomimus, I'M going to do something about all the problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Great attitude, T-Rex! And I'm sure people already working on problems will appreciate the help. Which problem(s) are you going to focus on?
T-Rex: Uh... all of them?
Utahraptor: Might help to focus on one or two of them.
T-Rex: Of COURSE! Utahraptor - that's IT!
T-Rex: There's BILLIONS of people alive right now, and surely - SURELY - there's not actually BILLIONS of problems. If everyone take one problem each and solve it, then it won't be a lick of work! And then we could have this licked lickety-split!
Off panel: Great, I'll take solving the problem of world hunger!
T-Rex: And I'll take our sudden overuse of lick-based idioms! It doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'm sure I can lick it into shape!
T-Rex (punchline): OH NO, IT'S GETTING WORSE




T-Rex: Hello and welcome to Spider-Fan, the #1 talk show for fans of Spider-Man.
T-Rex: As we all know, Spider-Man is a fake man who does not exist!
T-Rex: But we, as a people, write stories about him anyway. We want so badly to hear stories about this fake guy that we pay people to make up tales about him (this is called "lying"), and then draw pictures of their lies so we can see them easily.
T-Rex: This is called "comics".
Utahraptor: Question: is it true that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can?
T-Rex: Nope! Next question.
Utahraptor: Question: what things can a spider do that Spider-Man can't?
T-Rex: Have a passive breathing system that supports respiration without actively moving air around.
Off panel: Question: couldn't all this talk about Spider-Man being a fake idea be trivially applied to Batman as well?
T-Rex (punchline): NO; THIS RECORDING OF SPIDER-FAN IS NOW OVER; THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS




T-Rex: I know tons about my favourite fictional characters. I can talk about them at length!
T-Rex: And I do! I really do!
T-Rex: But I don't know anything about what's going on with my body!!
T-Rex: I'm serious. If purple poops start coming out of this bad boy tomorrow morning, I will have NO IDEA what's wrong. All I'll be able to do is walk into a doctor's office and say, "Sup? Listen, purple poops are coming out of my bum: awesome, or cause for concern? Here's some money, so let me know!"
Dromiceiomimus: That's what we have doctors for, T-Rex! They let us know our problems for money!
T-Rex: But that's my point! We ALL have bodies!
Utahraptor: So we... should all be doctors?
T-Rex: Yes! Shouldn't we? If you were a robot, wouldn't you store a copy of your blueprints and repair manual in your cyber brain somewhere? Doesn't that just seem... REASONABLE?
Utahraptor: Man! If I were a robot, a lot of things would be different.
Urahraptor: [starts daydreaming]
[Utahraptor's daydream]
Off panel: GREETINGS T-REX // I AM YOUR FRIEND UTAHROBOTER
T-Rex: I'm made of meat, so I get weaker AND forgetful as I get older!!
Off panel: YET I WILL LIVE FOREVER // HOW IRONIC
Off panel: IRON-IC // GET IT
Off panel (punchline): FUN FACT // I WAS ALSO PROGRAMMED FOR JOKES




T-Rex: We need MORE supernatural creatures. Everyone knows about vampires and zombies and ghosts and zombie ghosts. What we need is something new!
T-Rex: And I'm just the person to supply it!
T-Rex: Okay, so this NEW supernatural creature is like a ghost, but for inanimate objects. So it's a full moon and you hear music and you think "oh hey there's my portable music player I lost a few years back" but then when you reach for it YOUR HAND PASSES RIGHT THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S A GHOST!!
T-Rex: Terrifying.
Utahraptor: Seems pretty derivative of ghosts and not scary at all, actually?
T-Rex: Are you kidding me??
T-Rex: Once inanimate objects can become ghosts, ANYTHING can become ghosts. If a GHOST SUN shows up in the sky, I'm friggin' terrified! It's about to cook everything on Earth, and that's it for life, man! GAME OVER! Ghost suns are an extinction-level event, and there ain't NOTHING we can do!!
Off panel: In theory, couldn't a ghost sun keep us all alive after all OTHER suns have died in the heat death of the universe? Making it, in fact, a REVERSE extinction-level event?
T-Rex: Oh dang!!
T-Rex (punchline): Thank you ghost suns for your future service




T-Rex: Compared to when we were kids, it's the future! We have cell phones and what not, PLUS, a private corporation put a weird car in space! We are living in the FUTURE.
T-Rex: Why aren't we dressing like it?
T-Rex: Every single image I ever saw of the future had futuristic clothing. The particulars change - some may have big shoulder accents made of tin foil, while others may have fabulous Saturn-shaped belt buckles made of tin foil - but the basic idea is consistent: that whoever it is who is lucky enough to make it to tomorrow should DRESS like it.
Utahraptor: Sure, but today's fashion WOULD look futuristic to anyone from further back, like 150 years ago!
T-Rex: Bah!
T-Rex: A red solo cup in the GARBAGE would look futuristic 150 years ago. A ZIPPER would look futuristic 150 years ago, and a HAIRDRYER would blow their minds. I'm not interested in impressing dusty ol' black and white GRANDPAS, Utahraptor. I want to impress 6 year old me!
Off panel: Well, I'd say "then buy or make your own clothing", but you've clearly decided that "constant nudity" is more your style.
T-Rex: JUDGE NOT, MY FRIEND
T-Rex (punchline): LEST YE BE JUDGED BY AN EQUALLY NAKED MAN




Narrator: "HOW TO LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE"
Narrator: featuring
Narrator: TALKING DINOSAURS
T-Rex: That's me!
T-Rex: Many people wish to know how to live a meaningful life!
T-Rex: These people include newborn babies, youth, mature young adults, disenchanted middle-agers, executives - heck, even your own next-door neighbour may be secretely interested in living a meaningful life!
T-Rex: Some say dedicating your life to helping others is the key.
Utahraptor: That sounds like a good start!
T-Rex: However, these people are WRONG. The only way to truly live a meaningful life is to engage in sexual congress with a large number of partners!
Utahraptor: What?
Utahraptor: Seriously, what?
T-Rex: Hah hah, okay, you got me! I was just fooling. Good one though, eh?
T-Rex (punchline): Seriously, helping others is alright.




T-Rex: It's always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did. Why weren't people rapping until only a few decades ago? Did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop, and then not stop?
T-Rex: Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered... viable?
T-Rex: It's the same thing with any genre and medium, really! How come nobody thought of science fiction until Verne wrote "Forsooth, diary! To-day I am going to invente scientifical fictionne!"? I want to listen to Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331, and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it. Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes?
Utahraptor: You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.
T-Rex: But you get the idea!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it's not that big a step from that to rap. I'm sure there were people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:
T-Rex: Alright, this is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and uh, try to keep up.
T-Rex: "I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie to the hip hip hop, and you don't stop!"
T-Rex (punchline): Mozart!! I SAID to watch me for the changes and try to keep up!




Narrator: CLIMATE CHANGE COMICS
T-Rex: CLIMATE CHANGE, huh?
T-Rex: There certainly is a lot of climate that's CHANGING, right? Right?! Can I get a witness?
T-Rex: Or MAYBE, climate isn't changing at all. Or maybe it is, but who cares because it's all someone else's fault!
T-Rex: or maybe the climate is supposed to change because we all got new swimmin' trunks
Utahraptor: That is without exaggeration, T-Rex, the weakest comment on climate change that I have ever heard, or am ever likely to hear!
Utahraptor: You've distilled an important issue down to "something might be happening I dunno, maybe??" Also, you don't even mention human influence on the climate, which is a serious concern!
T-Rex: Serious concern? I just stepped on a tiny woman, so her only influence on the climate is that now she's dead.
T-Rex: In the climate.
T-Rex: Right now she's probably saying "OH MAN WHAT A CHANGE FOR ME! A CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT IS!!"
T-Rex (punchline): Hey, remember when there were frogs?




Narrator: DOG JOKES
T-Rex: Who wants to hear jokes about dogs?! I sure hope you do!
T-Rex: AND I SURE HOPE YOU BROUGHT SOME, because I'm tapped!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, this has been a disappointing morning
Narrator: THE END
Narrator: CAT JOKES
T-Rex: Who wants to hear jokes about cats?! I sure hope -
Utahraptor: - you know some!
Utahraptor: Because if not I'm going into the bank and saying "I am T-Rex wearing a Utahraptor mask, and the next time I come here WITHOUT my Utahraptor mask I'm totally robbing this place! These words forever take precedence over any denials I may say in the future."
T-Rex: ...MAN. That's watertight!
T-Rex: Okay, you've earned this one, my friend! What kind of cat keeps your grass short? A lawn MEOWer!
Off panel: Wow
Off panel (punchline): On second thought I'm doing that bank thing anyway




God: T-REX I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS
T-Rex: ...Go on.
God: I AM GOING TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS
God: AND WILL MAKE YOU GOOD AT IDIOM
T-Rex: Ah, that's totally salty!
God: NO THAT'S TOTALLY SWEET AND I CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO
T-Rex: Maybe I'm not BAD at idiom, dude! Maybe I'm GREAT at it. MAYBE rather than parroting old phrases, I push them in new directions, boldly evolving them into newer, greater forms. Maybe I'm the greatest linguistic mind of our generation, and maybe that's TOTALLY SALTY.
Utahraptor: Maybe "totally salty" is an obvious derivative of "totally sweet"!
T-Rex: MAYBE.
T-Rex: But maybe I know my new phrases must serve a world that hates and fears them, so they have to take baby steps towards acceptance. First it's "totally salty", then "So Salt", then "SS, but not in, like, the Hitler sense".
Off panel: ...Maybe you ARE bad at idiom.
T-Rex (punchline): YEAH MAYBE




T-Rex: QUANTUM EROTICA is gay and straight and lesbian and other ALL AT THE SAME TIME, and it only collapses into a single sexuality upon being observed by a reader! It's great and I invented it and guess what?
T-Rex: IT'S QUANTUM EROTICA O'CLOCK
T-Rex: Casey and Riley were alone at last. "Finally," breathed Riley into Casey's ear. "I've been wanting sex times all day." They kissed. While kissing, Casey's arms wrapped around Riley, found a very enticing bottom, and gave it a squeeze.
Dromiceiomimus: Whoah! Smooth move, Casey!!
T-Rex: I know! Casey is good at squeezing bums; that's pretty much canon
Utahraptor: Okay, but no way can you describe the sex itself! Different body parts come into play.
T-Rex: NOT A PROBLEM.
T-Rex: Casey moaned as Riley moved -
Utahraptor: OKAY OKAY YOU WIN THANKS I'M GOOD FOR EROTICA YOU CAN STOP NOW
T-Rex: It's great! Since everyone uses euphemisms around sex, I can talk about sex really explicitly using euphemisms!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: "Casey and Riley sat in front of each other and showed off their naughty bits!"
T-Rex: hah hah hah
T-Rex: oh man
T-Rex (punchline): how embarrassing




T-Rex: You know what's funny?
T-Rex: Death!
T-Rex: Hah hah! Cause you're just walking along, and then it's "Whoops! I'm DEAD!"
T-Rex: Eh, Dromiceiomimus?
T-Rex: "Whoops!"
Utahraptor: That's not funny, T-Rex! It's tragic!
T-Rex: What, death?
Utahraptor: Yes, death! Would you find it so funny if you died?
T-Rex: Well, my friend: that depends. Did I die in a funny way? For instance, did I smoke a cigarette, and then my eyes exploded?
T-Rex: Hah hah! The dangers of smoking!
T-Rex (punchline): Seriously though, you should quit.




T-Rex: One day everyone on Earth became immortal, but only the dinosaurs. AND their children became immortal too, if they chose to have them.
T-Rex: ...I think we're good?
T-Rex: And YES, this would quickly lead to overpopulation, but I built in a loophole: we could still kill OURSELVES. So if conditions ever became intolerable, we had a way out.
Dromiceiomimus: So Earth therefore became desperately overpopulated, with life that was, for most, juuuuuust MARGINALLY better than death?
T-Rex: ...Man, I guess so, huh?? THANKS ECONOMICS!!
Utahraptor: But we could improve planetary conditions, so more people would stick around!
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: ...but that just highlights the reality that better lives result in more people living, pushing things back to marginality.
T-Rex: MAN. Is there not a SINGLE STORY in which immortality doesn't screw over everyone forever?
T-Rex: Wait. WAIT. I've got it!
[a book cover with text in Batman The Animated Series font]
Book cover: THE DAY BATMAN BECAME IMMORTAL, AND ALSO REAL
Book cover: AND ALSO MY BEST FRIEND
Book cover: ALSO, I BECAME IMMORTAL TOO
Book cover (punchline): I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE WHOLE STORY AWAY IN MY BOOK TITLE SO I'LL STOP NOW, BUT LET ME SAY THIS: WE DEFINITELY KISS




T-Rex: Today is the day nothing can possibly go wrong! For today is the day I am wearing...
T-Rex: ...MY NEW HAT.
Narrator: SHORTLY:
T-Rex: It has been brought to my attention that I somehow forgot to wear my hat, new or otherwise. Today is an unmitigated catastrophe from which there can be no recovery.
Dromiceiomimus: Your new hat was a curse; had it not existed you would never have known the fount of despair that comes from forgetting to wear it.
T-Rex: Hard agree.
Narrator: THE NEXT DAY:
T-Rex: Now, TODAY is the day I wear my new hat! I -
Utahraptor: Hatless again, my dude.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, if someone tells you making change is easy, you call them a liar. I've been trying to wear a new hat for two days and I still can't nail it. Who's the philosopher who said life is suffering?
Utahraptor: Um... all of them, at some point?
T-Rex: Well, they NAILED IT.
Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER:
T-Rex: I wore my new hat yesterday!! And I will say this:
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): It was JUST OKAY




T-Rex: You guys, what if reincarnation is real?!
God: T-REX
T-Rex: I'm serious, what if it is??
T-Rex: What if we had clear and unassailable proof that everyone who dies gets a do-over?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe people would be less sad at funerals?
T-Rex: LESS SAD AT FUNERALS?? I mean, okay, yes, but you know what else happens? THE WORLD CHANGES FOREVER. Projects that would take lifetimes to complete now become easily achievable! YOU CAN TRAVEL THE WORLD FOR FREE JUST BY DYING, WHICH IS LIKE, REALLY EASY TO DO. Death becomes a brief time-out instead of getting kicked from the game!
Utahraptor: You're treating this like a video game?
T-Rex: Of course!
T-Rex: They're our best evidence for what happens when people respawn! They prove that people have A LOT OF FUN.
Utahraptor: Yes, I can't wait to live in a world where adults get killed by laser blasters and then two days later newborn babies are running around trying to get their comeuppance with other laser blasters.
T-Rex: Come on Utahraptor, OBVIOUSLY that's a ridiculous situation.
T-Rex: ...Wait, no, OBVIOUSLY that's an amazing situation! OH MY GOD. I'll be back later!
T-Rex (punchline): I need to go write some fanfiction about my own ideas!!




Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
Narrator: Today's origin story:
Narrator: THE PHRASE "BALLS TO THE WALL"
T-Rex: Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles!
T-Rex: In fact, it's quite the opposite. The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!
T-Rex: The "balls" in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane's throttle control. When the throttle was at full, the "balls" would be "to the wall" of the cockpit!
T-Rex: And that's the origin of the phrase "balls to the wall".
Utahraptor: You are incorrect! The phrase comes from olde-fashioned steam-powered trains!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: It's true! Basically, the engines had two weighted balls, attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine. As the engine speed increased, these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force! At top speed, they would be parallel to the ground, nearly touching the "walls" of the shaft!
T-Rex: Hence, "balls to the wall"! Man!
T-Rex (punchline): That's sweet!




T-Rex: Somebody please write a really popular song about me, okay?
T-Rex: And make it really catchy, okay?
T-Rex: And make sure all the lyrics are really positive, stuff like "Oh T-Rex you're so fine / you're so fine you blow my mind / Oh T-Rex / You are assuredly the best is what I'm communicating here", okay?
Dromiceiomimus: Why?
T-Rex: A #1 song all about how great I am - it's the best PR imaginable! Folks'll meet me and say, "YOU'RE T-Rex?! Suddenly, arousal washes over me as unstoppably as the ocean tide."
Utahraptor: You meet some eloquent people!
T-Rex: Once this song is written I will, anyway!
Utahraptor: But have you considered that no song stays popular forever? There's bound to be a backlash, and the faster a song becomes popular, the greater the backlash to it once it begins to fall from favour!
T-Rex: Impossible! I'm certain that THIS song will be so good that, for the rest of time, folks will forever say,
Off panel: Dear God, this song is like a polka equivalent of Vanilla Ice covering "Achy Breaky Heart" in a quarter-time falsetto.
T-Rex: Hey! Hey you, across the street!
T-Rex (punchline): Daaaaang.




T-Rex: Well, my screenplay for "(A)bort, (R)etry, (M)urder?" didn't work out. Nobody wanted to produce it! So, I have started a new screenplay, based on the Structured Query Language for databases!
T-Rex: It's called...
T-Rex: "UPDATE bodies SET status = 'DEAD'"!
T-Rex: It's about a database administrator for a large company who uncovers a secret database by accident!
T-Rex: A database... of MURDERS!
Utahraptor: Your screenplay, once again, appeals only to a micro-niche market!
T-Rex: How do you mean?
Utahraptor: Well, the only people who will enjoy it are those in the intersection of the set of people who know databases with the set of people who like crappy movies!
T-Rex (punchline): Pretty nerdy, my friend!




T-Rex: Guys! I have some bad news!
T-Rex: I don't think I'm cut out to be a law-abiding member of society!!
T-Rex: When I see illegal billboards my instinct is not to call the city and register a complaint - my instinct is to tear it down! And when I see a jerk sitting in a parked car at night, projecting an ad on the side of a building, I don't want to call the police and report a citizen acting against the best interests of EVERY OTHER CITIZEN with the exception of himself. I want to disable his projector! And by "disable" I mean "fully destroy"?
Utahraptor: So apparently you want to be a vigilante, but just about illegal advertising!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: It's a small enough issue that I can understand it fully, AND it's a problem I can solve at night with my fists. I can't solve global warming at night with my fists, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Don't even say it. I can't!
Narrator: THAT EVENING:
T-Rex: ATTENTION, ANYONE WHO HAS A LARGE CARBON FOOTPRINT! DO YOU WANT TO BE PUNCHED?
Off panel: not really!!
T-Rex (punchline): SEE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I TRIED TO TELL MY FRIEND UTAHRAPTOR




T-Rex: A singularity refers to a future moment when we create artificial intelligences that are smarter than we are. It's called this because things will be so different, it's impossible to predict past it. Everything will change!
T-Rex: For instance: these smart machines could make even smarter machines!
T-Rex: And so on until we have super duper smart machines that will look on us as mere playthings. Will they destroy us? Or will we merge ourselves with technology, and in doing so become a new, more cybernetic lifeform? Our choices seem limited to either becoming something new, or facing irrelevance and obsolescence!
Utahraptor: So why does a super intelligent AI make predictions impossible?
T-Rex: Because too much has changed!
T-Rex: Also because we're too dumb. It'd be like a dog trying to predict what its owner does.
Utahraptor: I think most dogs can do that with some accuracy, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Right. Well - I've never really been one for "apt analogies".
Narrator: T-REX IS TELLING THE TRUTH:
T-Rex: Check it! Eating food in bed is like - a crappy duck?
T-Rex (punchline): What the heck, everyone?




T-Rex: Hello! I have some opinions about your name. Perhaps you'd like to hear them?
Narrator: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH YOUR NAME
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: I know you probably didn't choose it, but still. Your name.
T-Rex: Oh my god, your name.
T-Rex: I like you but sometimes I have trouble dealing with your ridiculous name.
Utahraptor: So what's this person's name?
T-Rex: Rather than saying it, I'll describe it!
T-Rex: You are one of five lucky children selected to try out new ice cream flavours. Do you try "Hugsberry Lime" or "Pulp And Paper"?
Utahraptor: I -
T-Rex: It doesn't matter what you choose because you have a super dumb name! Suddenly, you die of it.
T-Rex: Your score is zero points. Your name is carved on your gravestone; beneath it your epitaph reads "Aw geez, I think someone messed up with this name. Good grief."
T-Rex (punchline): It was ad-libbed by the gravestone carver in a SEVERE breach of professional protocol!!




T-Rex: Dear guy whose car alarm went off last night outside my window at three in the morning:
T-Rex: Forget you, man!
T-Rex: Your car alarm is ridiculous. Years of trigger-happy alarms have trained the public to ignore them, and nobody would care if your tastelessly noisy car got stolen anyway. If someone had driven off in it last night as the alarm was blaring, I would have applauded him! THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY SENSE OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY.
Utahraptor: Would you really have been happy if the car got stolen?
T-Rex: The honest answer is "heck yes!"
T-Rex: I would have smiled as I drifted back to nappy times. But in my defence, I was really tired! Plus, the guy was a jerk. He was all, "Man, if my car gets stolen, I want the WHOLE BLOCK to know! My car is totally important to everybody."
Utahraptor: Maybe the alarm came with the car?
Narrator: ANYWAY, THEY TALK ABOUT CAR ALARMS FOR A WHILE, UNTIL A REALLY ATTRACTIVE FRIEND OF THEIRS SHOWS UP!
T-Rex: Oh man! Let's go to the beach and hang out in flattering swimsuits!
Off panel: Sounds like fun, guys!
T-Rex (punchline): Now THIS is what I call "an interesting narrative"!




T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for thanking my friends for their friendship!
T-Rex: Friendship Tuesday, everyone!!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm really glad we're friends. I like how we hang out and I like that we've shared so much together. So - thanks!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, I'm glad we're friends too! I like that we can talk about things without worrying about how it might look to someone else.
T-Rex: Excellent!
T-Rex: And I'm glad WE'RE friends as well, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Hey, me too!
T-Rex: Super! I've never said this, but I love how when you come over for dinner you always bring some wine. It's old-school classiness!
Utahraptor: My pleasure, T-Rex! I enjoy how when YOU come over, you always say "Thank you for inviting me into your home." It always sounds sincere!
God: I NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO THANK ME FOR MY FRIENDSHIP T-REX
T-Rex: I haven't forgotten! I was just, um, going to thank everyone else on the planet first?
God: T-REX LISTEN
God (punchline): WHEN YOU LIE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT SOUND BETTER THAN THE TRUTH




Narrator: STORIES
Narrator: FOR MEN
T-Rex: Men! We like stories, right?
Multiple off-panel voices: Right!
T-Rex: But they have to be good stories. Stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys, and then some explosions happen to them!
Dromiceiomimus: You sure like explosions, huh?
T-Rex: In a good story, they function as punctuation marks. Hamlet says "To be or not to be", and the building behind him blows up. It is spectacular. The audience whispers, "Yes. This is what Shakespeare meant."
Utahraptor: So your story is Hamlet only with explosions instead of punctuation.
T-Rex: You say it like it's not fantastic!
Utahraptor: Do the characters even react to the explosions at all?
T-Rex: Sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them. Sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast. It depends on the scene, you know?
Narrator: THE ULTIMATE STORY FOR MEN
T-Rex: Hamlet sips some whiskey while punching a man in the nose! Ophelia says she's crazy for him and they go on a helicopter ride. A ghost appears, and when Hamlet high fives him he explodes! Then Denmark explodes.
T-Rex (punchline): Later, Ophelia's topless!




T-Rex: One of you becomes the dreamer, and the rest, the dreams. The dreams, though they cannot articulate why, even to themselves, forever run from the dreamer.
Narrator: TAG AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: The dreams can take many forms, but generally assume the limited form of a screaming child. The dreams run from the dreamer, desiring at the same moment to be caught and to be free. These desires do battle in the dream-mind, while the dreamer, unable to comprehend the essential futility that surrounds him, gives chase. He runs wildly after the dreams, a ridiculous parody of who he was before this terrible game began. They are all reduced to clowns.
T-Rex: The game is ended when a dreamer achieves even a fleeting touch of the dream. That touch will have to suffice.
Utahraptor: You're - !
T-Rex: Though dozens may play, Utahraptor, there can be only one winner, that single moment of briefly-realized potential doing more damage than a thousand losses. This is a special kind of madness.
Utahraptor: I was going to say "You're it!", but now I'm going home to be sad.
T-Rex: That's right! I NEVER
T-Rex: LOSE
T-Rex (punchline): AT TAG




T-Rex: A pet is a good thing to get if you want something cute that is entirely dependent on you for its very survivOH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE
T-Rex: AN ALIVE THING DEPENDS ON ME AND IF I SUCK IT DIES!!
Dromiceiomimus: Dude, calm down! You can handle this: it's just a dog! Some people have CHILDREN, and they're way more dependent than pets are!
T-Rex: AAAAAHHHHH
T-Rex: I AM FREAKING OUT A LITTLE HERE, NOT GOING TO LIE
Utahraptor: You're afraid of the responsibility?
T-Rex: I'm not afraid!! I'm INFORMED!
T-Rex: I've nearly killed MYSELF with my own stupidity tons of times, let alone someone else! I once ate broken glass because it was at the bottom of a half-eaten bag of chips! As I ate them I thought "gosh these chips are real crunchy".
Utahraptor: W-What?
T-Rex: I told you this! My roommate broke a Christmas ornament and swept it up into a mostly-empty bag of chips, then I got home late n' hungry!!
Off panel: Really? You did this?
T-Rex (punchline): YES AND I DID NOT SURVIVE MY ORDEAL TO BE JUDGED BY THOSE WITH BETTER DECISION-MAKING SKILLS




T-Rex: We are surrounded by computers, so we should probably know something about them, huh??
Narrator: COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH T-REX
T-Rex: Anyway, the deal with computers is that they're better at math than you are, and we all just have to deal with that. But we're still better than computers at a few things, including: hearing a paradox without exploding, understanding this emotion called "love", and getting a TINY bit of water on us and not breaking forever even though it was just a stupid tiny bit of water.
Utahraptor: What does the future hold for computer science?
T-Rex: I'm glad you asked!
T-Rex: Future computers will unravel paradoxes with the same gentle skill they use in unravelling our hearts, and the only water to affect them will be the joyous falling of our tears as we weep in the face of their perfection.
Narrator: CONGRATULATIONS
Narrator (punchline): "YOU = COMPUTER SCIENCE EXPERT" NOW EVALUATES TO TRUE




T-Rex: Did you know there are only seven different stories? It's true! All stories are variations on these narratives.
T-Rex: Anyway whatever, SPOILER ALERT, here they are!
T-Rex: RAGS TO RICHES: someone poor gets some money. Imagine if it was you??
Dromiceiomimus: THE QUEST: someone left a thing somewhere and someone else goes to get the thing. It's like an RPG fetch quest, but instead of doing it, you have to read!
T-Rex: BOY MEETS BOY: two boys meet and maybe they have some shared interests; let's find out
T-Rex: BOY LOSES BOY: the classic mountaineering story wherein someone gets lost.
Utahraptor: AND MAYBE DIES??
Utahraptor: BOY GETS BOY AGAIN: okay, he didn't die after all.
T-Rex: HUMAN VS. HUMAN: these stories are only good if you want to read about humans, a very dicey proposition. Once the public sees that EVERY STORY about humans could be about dinosaurs instead, this market will collapse.
Off panel: Why would anyone want to read about humans? They're like us, but smaller and with more boring bodies.
T-Rex: Oh gross!!
T-Rex: I, uh -
T-Rex (punchline): I think I stepped on one back there??




T-Rex: Well, that's another house gone. I seem to be going through houses like other people go through -
T-Rex: um
T-Rex: - some manner of disposable goods!
Dromiceiomimus: Do you think this might be the result of all the bad house-related karma you've earned by stomping on other people's houses every day?
T-Rex: I don't believe in karma!
T-Rex: So: "Probably not!"
Utahraptor: You have to admit you've got through a lot of houses lately!
T-Rex: So?
T-Rex: That doesn't imply that there's some cosmic judge keeping score of my actions. You're making a logical fallacy, namely "after which, therefore because of".
Utahraptor: That's not a logical fallacy.
T-Rex: Yes it is.
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex (punchline): I tell you man, I was all over the logic books in high school!




T-Rex: Before copyright was a thing, anyone could make up stories! You could say "One day Zeus turned into a goat to have sex with a human" and folks would be like "Sure I guess, why not."
T-Rex: AND NOT EVEN ZEUS HIMSELF COULD STOP YOU!!
T-Rex: But now that copyright IS a thing, people's estates can still own and control stories for decades and decades after the death of the author. So now if I want to say "One day Mickey Mouse and the teens from Harry Potter met up with Batman to talk about how great the Dreamcast was", I could get arrested for THREE separate crimes!
Utahraptor: Four, really, for implying that the Dreamcast was good.
T-Rex: WHAAAA-
T-Rex: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??
T-Rex: ...Although upon consideration, I haven't played it for years and I'm certain nostalgia is clouding my judgment to some degree.
Off panel: And friend, I can recognize that in any subjective measurement of a cultural artifact, different elements will appeal to different people.
Narrator (punchline): "SENSIBLE DISCUSSIONS"




T-Rex: Civilization is great because it lets people specialize! We don't ALL have to grow our own food and hunt our own cows so we can eat delicious cow parts.
T-Rex: Instead, we can do something else, and trade for the delicious cow parts we crave!
T-Rex: So that's what we do! We have fewer and fewer farmers and more and more, I don't know, "SEO Email Marketing Specialists", which are four words I chose at random, but which I think we can agree a) is DEFINITELY a thing, b) is pretty specialized, and c) would be COMPLETELY useless in a post-apocalyptic society.
Utahraptor: I mean, we'd ALL be pretty useless if civilization collapsed.
T-Rex: Right?!
T-Rex: But not the farmers! They're the FOUNDATION. They meet our basic needs, so that the rest of us are free to invent more esoteric ones. So let's thank farmers, without whom specialization - and therefore CIVILIZATION HERSELF - would not be possible.
Banner: Thanks farmers!
Banner (punchline): Technically, you’re what allow people to be full-time spammers




T-Rex: Normally people have trouble with sequels after their first idea is so, and I'll say it, so transcendentally brilliant. But not me! I have ideas for basically infinite sequels.
T-Rex: Basically infinite out-of-genre cover sequels, that is!
T-Rex: When my explosion-centric disaster movie comes out and people want more, I will say to them, "No, ACTUALLY, you want the same thing, but this time, as a gross-out comedy!"
Dromiceiomimus: So the story starts out the same, but the guy slips on some lube and then lands in an old jock strap!
T-Rex: Hah! PRECISELY. And it keeps happening throughout the film. The power goes out, and nationwide, folks slip on the lube.
Utahraptor: The next sequel could be a road trip movie!
T-Rex: EVEN BETTER.
T-Rex: Some TEENS go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction! You can see it in the background of some of the shots, but they never notice... because they are all too busy learning about friendship!
Utahraptor: I like it! Dozens of sequels, all revolving around the same story!
T-Rex: A western! A loner cowboy, caught between wilderness and civilization, enters the nation and tries to stop the disasters!
Off panel: Does he succeed?
T-Rex: No. He shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it, though!
T-Rex (punchline): "There is a showdown between a cowboy and a volcano."




T-Rex: I wonder what life would be like if I were a woman!
T-Rex: I wonder!
T-Rex: [starts daydreaming]
[T-Rex's daydream]
T-Rex: Hello Dromiceiomimus! Do you want to go shopping for women's underwear? We are after all both women!
Dromiceiomimus: That is true! I see no reason why we both couldn't go out and buy some women's underwear!
T-Rex: Nor do I!
[T-Rex's daydream]
Narrator: LATER...
Utahraptor: Are you doing anything tonight?
[T-Rex's daydream]
T-Rex: Why no - besides going out with a strapping young man such as yourself!
Utahraptor: Excellent! Shall we say, nine-ish?
T-Rex: It's a date!
T-Rex: [stops daydreaming]
T-Rex (punchline): I'm glad I keep these little fantasies to myself!




T-Rex: Okay so the first is .dogs, obviously. It's so obvious that I'm surprised I even have to say it.
Narrator: NEW TLDS THAT ARE NEEDED
T-Rex: Moving on, there are tons of terrible website trends, and it'd be great to know that a site sucks in advance, so I propose ".WeJustRepostThingsWithoutCreditLOL", ".OurCommentsSectionIsFullOfRacistsThoughSoHeadsUp", and ".WeInterruptEveryArticleToBegYouToFollowUsOnFacebookAndTwitterSoBetterGetUsedToThatRealQuick".
Dromiceiomimus: Those are kinda hard to type!
T-Rex: Oh no, then people might not visit these sites!!
Utahraptor: What about just ".LOL"?
T-Rex: Pfft.
T-Rex: Anything on .LOL would be the least funny thing ever in time. HOWEVER, everything on .OGC would be AMAZING. Wikipedia gets .FYI! Blogs get .TMI and .IMO!
Utahraptor: Yes! And celebrity gossip sites can have .OMG and .SMH!
T-Rex: Whoah!!
Off panel: What? It stands for "shaking my head".
T-Rex (punchline): ...Utahraptor it stands for "suck my hole" and if you think otherwise then SMH




T-Rex: Brrr... it's getting cold out!
T-Rex: This means that winter is coming!
T-Rex: Luckily, as a warm-blooded being, this cold weather means little to me!
Utahraptor: That's a matter of some debate!
T-Rex: Oh?
Utahraptor: Yes, some would argue that you are in fact a cold-blooded being!
T-Rex: Who'd say that?
Utahraptor: Um - you know... people!
T-Rex: Who?
Utahraptor: Just this guy I know, alright?
T-Rex (punchline): I'll kick his ass!




T-Rex: God, what would you do if you had a secret, and it was awesome, but you were worried that if someone found it out then it wouldn't be as special anymore?
God: FLOOD THE PLANET
T-Rex: Huh!
God: DUDE SO WHAT'S THE SECRET
T-Rex: I'm not telling! That's why it's a SECRET.
Dromiceiomimus: Oooh! What's a secret?
T-Rex: Nothing! I don't have any secrets!
T-Rex: ...What IS a secret? Whoah, you guys! I've so few secrets that I've JUST NOW forgotten what a secret is!
Utahraptor: Wow, that's the least-plausible denial I've ever heard!
T-Rex: And yet, the most compelling?
Utahraptor: Hey man, if you don't want to share your secret with me, that's fine. I'm not gonna pry!
T-Rex: Okay, thanks, because this one is a TOP secret. This is one secret that I'll take with me to my grave.
God: T-REX I USED OMNIPOTENCE TO FIND OUT YOUR SECRET AND MAN EVERYONE KNOWS THERE'S A HIDDEN 1UP JUST BEFORE THE FIRST PIT IN THE FIRST LEVEL OF SUPER MARIO BROS
T-Rex: Dude!!
T-Rex (punchline): They do NOW




T-Rex: If you drop something heavy on your foot, your first instinct is likely to scream in pain.
T-Rex: Dudes and ladies! This is not such a useful reaction!
T-Rex: Screaming doesn't fix the problem, it just draws attention to your bruisey foot. And when your scream is followed by cursing, THAT just says "My foot hurts now, and I believe this is equivalent to poo."
T-Rex: We can do better!
Utahraptor: What else would you suggest?
T-Rex: Anything, man!
T-Rex: Throw a punch! Yell "Totally intentional, folks!!" Tuck into a spin to deflect any other falling items! ANYTHING's better than the standard "ARGH FRIG OW FRIG".
Utahraptor: I think I'd rather NOT be around a guy who punches upon injury.
T-Rex: Whatever, man! Bears do it, and everyone likes bears!
Narrator: LATER, T-REX FEELS REGRET FOR HOW THE CONVERSATION WENT. HE WORRIES THAT UTAHRAPTOR WANTED TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION, BUT HE WAS MAKING JOKES ABOUT BEARS.
T-Rex: Sometimes I worry that if I were someone else, I wouldn't want to be friends with me?
Narrator (punchline): THE END.




T-Rex: Santa has a herd of flying reindeer. He uses them to achieve a heavier-than-air circumnavigation of the planet once a year!
T-Rex: In retrospect, this raises a ton of questions!
T-Rex: Are the reindeer born with flight powers, and if so, how do you train baby animals that can FLY and have heads mounted with DEADLY ANTLERS? Is this truly reindeer-based organic flight, and if so, can the same genes be spliced in to allow US to run, lean back, and sprint across the sky?
T-Rex: Why are the heavens being denied to us, Santa?
Utahraptor: Maybe it's done by magic!
T-Rex: That only raises more questions!!
T-Rex: Magic being real is kind of a big deal, dude! Magic isn't bound by physical law. Magic gets us flying reindeer, but ALSO get us bowls of water that never empty, which you might also recognize as INFINITE SOURCES OF ENERGY?? Look, all I'm saying is I want in.
Utahraptor: Write him a letter!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Santa wrote me back!!
Off panel: What'd he say?
T-Rex: blah blah cultural contamination, blah blah planet not ready for the power, blah blah and then there's a free gift card for the mall!
T-Rex (punchline): ...NICE!




[colourful text with various font effects like 3D shadows, gradients etc.]
Heading: AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR
Heading: also starring T-REX
Text: This morning I skipped breakfast and met T-Rex for lunch. He seemed excited. He always seems excited.
Text: I asked him why, and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company, and wanted T-Rex to call because he's better at these sorts of things. They'd failed to deliver her package four times now. T-Rex already has "suckified delivery companies" on his revenge list (he'd said), so he was pleased to call. He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse, got a full head of steam, and called them up. Long story short, the package had actually been delivered that morning. T-Rex claims victory.
Text: I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.
Text: My contrarian position (I freely admit it) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone: with companies this size, there's no way she was responsible for the package. Responsibility is so diffused that really, nobody is responsible - it's a system failure, and the person in the call centre can't change the system. He replied that as his only contact point, agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he's not going to make allowances for someone else's broken system. We agreed to differ.
Text: I realize that this is my diary for the new year, and all I've written about so far is T-Rex. The responsibility for this, I feel, lies solely in this Christmas gift "stationary" from T-Rex himself. He's drawn himself in every panel, and the same pre-printed title takes up all the space in the first one. Still - grocery shopping's more fun.
T-Rex: pick up eggs
T-Rex: eggs are great
T-Rex (punchline): you can put them on your plate




T-Rex: "Garden path" sentences are those that trick you into thinking that they will mean one thing, but then as you read more of the sentence, that meaning is shown to be false!
T-Rex: For instance: "The horse raced past the barn fell"!
Dromiceiomimus: Why, that sentence is senseless!
T-Rex: Aha, my friend, so it would seem! But it actually refers to a horse, which at some point in the past was raced past a barn, and now that same horse has fallen over!
Utahraptor: That sentence is stupid!
T-Rex: What are you saying?
Utahraptor: What I'm SAYING is that nobody would ever say that. They'd say, "The horse that I raced past the barn has now fallen over"!
T-Rex: Well, they could, but they could ALSO say my sentence!
Utahraptor: Only if they were incurably insane! Do horses even fall over?
T-Rex: Sure man, all the time!
T-Rex (punchline): Farmers call them nature's dominoes!




T-Rex: Depending on when in their lives this happens, the "OH MY GOD" that escapes your lips could be one of deepest sympathy OR terrific excitement!
Narrator: SO YOUR FRIENDS ARE GETTING PREGNANT
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Well, here's the new normal: your friends are going to talk about babies for the next several years. Are you interested in babies? If yes, terrific! If no, however, you'd better start learning how to pretend.
Dromiceiomimus: Here are some useful expressions to say when confronted with someone's baby!
T-Rex: "What a neat baby!"
Utahraptor: "This particular baby is definitely distinguishable from other babies!"
T-Rex: "If there's one thing this planet needs, it's more of us running around the place!"
Utahraptor: "You're a champ at life choices, and this baby you're now responsible for for the next 18 years PROVES it!"
Narrator: NEVERMIND, JUST SAY "OH WOW, WHAT A CUTE BABY!!" LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES
T-Rex: Yeah definitely -
T-Rex (punchline): definitely read to the end of this web card before putting any of this advice into action




T-Rex: Bruce Swain, my legally and creatively distinct character, moves to New York City! And his parents get shot by criminals, so he decides to change his name and fight crime!
T-Rex: He decides he must become... Abe Atman!
T-Rex: And Abe Atman has a friend, Joe Kerr, only Joe falls at work one day and suffers brain damage. He's - well, he's criminally insane. Abe tries to help him, but Joe keeps getting worse, falling in with criminals like Pen Guinn (car theft) and the one and only Rita Lerr (computer espionage)!
Dromiceiomimus: Wait a minute... Pen Guinn? THE Rita Lerr?
T-Rex: MAY I REMIND YOU MY CHARACTERS ARE LEGALLY AND CREATIVELY DISTINCT??
Utahraptor: T-Rex, did you even try making up your own characters?
T-Rex: I did! Quite successfully, obvs!
Utahraptor: No, what you've done is convert Batman names into semi-plausible given names. Why not write a story where Batman goes undercover as "Abe Atman"? At least that would be more honest.
T-Rex: And the Riddler goes undercover as "Rita Lerr"! AND THEN THEY GO ON A DATE BY ACCIDENT! YES. THIS IS AMAZING.
Narrator: SOON: NOBODY WANTS TO BUY T-REX'S HOME-MADE COMICS:
T-Rex (punchline): Hey, God! Please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can; and the wisdom to know why people would buy other comics when mine has the Riddler in drag in it??




T-Rex: I am a man who enjoys eating a barbequed pork chop now and again and then a few times more.
T-Rex: There's no shame in that!
T-Rex: And if you are a man - OR a woman, Dromiceiomimus! - who shares my love for tasty barbequed meat, then you should come over tonight and we'll have a barbeque!
Dromiceiomimus: You can barbeque vegetables, T-Rex. I'll bring some vegetables and I'll teach you how!
T-Rex: FINE
Utahraptor: You can also barbeque whole chickens, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh man, and you'll bring some chickens and teach me how?
Utahraptor: Sure! I'm sure I can pick some up.
T-Rex: EXCELLENT. It's going to be a meat and smoke orgy, Utahraptor. I'm pretty sure we'll end up eating one of ALL of God's creatures, which reminds me, I should invite God to this!
Narrator: LATER:
God: T-REX THERE ARE LIKE TWENTY TRILLION DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACTERIA THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BARBEQUE TO TASTE ONE OF ALL THE LIFE ON EARTH
God: THAT SAID
God (punchline): THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO I'M TOTALLY THERE




T-Rex: I want to write something that'll make people see the world through fresh eyes! Something they'll want to pass on to their children!
God: YOU WANT TO WRITE THE LITTLE PRINCE
T-Rex: BASICALLY.
T-Rex: Except that's been done! I want something NEW that will touch the heart of everyone, WITHOUT EXCEPTION.
Dromiceiomimus: This is the desire authors have, isn't it? To say something new that is nevertheless eternal? To really touch people, to change their lives for the better using only their ideas?
T-Rex: I guess! I bet some authors just want to tell jokes about dinosaurs though.
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: That wouldn't be so bad
Utahraptor: So - get to work! Get to writing!
T-Rex: I can't! I need INSPIRATION.
Utahraptor: Okay, here: take something that's common to everyone, and present it in an empathic, sympathetic light. How about - letting down someone you love! We've all done it and I don't think anyone enjoys it. There's pathos there.
T-Rex: Brilliant! You've really helped me out, Utahraptor!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex (punchline): I call my tale, "The Alluring Person with Hidden Greatness (Just Like You!) Who Accidentally Let Down Someone he Loves but then Made Amends and They Kissed: An Action-Packed Tale of the Star Wars Universe, But Afterwards They Visit The Enterprise And Bender Is There"




Narrator: I GUESS I HAD A GOOD TIME LAST NIGHT even though we didn't have sex
Narrator: A WEB CARD
T-Rex: Classy, dude!
T-Rex: Anyway, dear recipient of this card: the sender had a good time last night, even though you didn't have sex with him! You don't NEED to have sex to have a good time. Just like me!
Dromiceiomimus: Yesterday you told me you wanted your epitaph to be "T-Rex Always Needed Sex To Have A Good Time."
T-Rex: It's just - it's such bad timing that you would mention that right now, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: Did you seriously say you wanted that as your epitaph?
T-Rex: I was joking!
T-Rex: If I have an epitaph I want it to be "Here Lies T-Rex / He Was Great / Actually Hold On A Second / He's Still Alive."
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Alright then. Well. Back to the card, huh?
T-Rex: Dear card recipient, the sender had a good time last night, even though you two didn't have sex! I'm going to say your name now to show how personalized this card is.
T-Rex: Here I go!
T-Rex (punchline): "         "




T-Rex: Oh man! I've just had an elephant of a good idea!
T-Rex: TOUCH-o-vision!
T-Rex: Smell-o-vision has been tried, and vision and hearing are taken care of, but two senses remain yet untapped! Taste-o-vision sounds disgusting, but - there's so much potential for touch-o-vision!
Dromiceiomimus: Like what?
T-Rex: Like it's a boxing movie, and whenever the underdog hero gets punched, you get punched! You'd start to think, "MAN, I hope that guy wins. Then, I'll get punched less."
Utahraptor: This - you know this is a terrible idea, right?
T-Rex: I admit only that there are issues!
Utahraptor: Issues! You're building a robotic punching machine that can punch an entire room of people all at once. What if the elderly were in the audience? What if it was calibrated wrong and punched through a guy?
T-Rex: Ooh, what if? What if? Here's a what if for you: WHAT IF I MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS??
Narrator: TESTING THE PUNCHING MACHINE:
T-Rex: OW! What the hell, Punchbot?!
Off panel (punchline): ERROR 14: I LIKE PUNCHING




T-Rex: I need to have the best costume ever this Hallowe'en!
T-Rex: But I don't want to do something that's been done before!
Dromiceiomimus: How about a spooky mummy?
T-Rex: Lame.
Dromiceiomimus: A puppy?
T-Rex: Lame!
T-Rex: I know! I'll go as a robot!
Utahraptor: A robot?!
T-Rex: What's cooler than a robotic T-Rex?
T-Rex: THE·EVALUATION·OF·THAT STATEMENT·RESULTS·IN·A NULL·OUTPUT·SET
Utahraptor: ERROR DETECTED IN COMPUTATION
T-Rex: INPUT DISREGARDED: INFERIOR ROBOTIC MODEL

T-Rex: There are a lot of out of copyright characters that you can use for free! For example, may I suggest...
T-Rex: MARY'S LITTLE LAMB??
T-Rex: We know SEVERAL things about this famous nursery rhymes lamb: it's little, its fleece is white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went the lamb is sure to go.
T-Rex: Delightful! I can't wait to find out more about this dynamic hero of song and story!!
Utahraptor: So - what are we supposed to do with this lamb character?
T-Rex: Whatever we want! That's the point!
T-Rex: Perhaps a gritty reboot where the lamb is instead a L.A.M.B: a bionic enforcer robot? Or flip the script and give us a dystopia where the lamb has a little Mary? Or MAYBE the lamb instead has a M.A.R.Y: a different and more DEADLY type of bionic enforcer!!
T-Rex: M.A.R.Y had a little L.A.M.B., its F.L.E.E.C.E. was white as S.N.O.W., and everywhere that M.A.R.Y. went, the L.A.M.B. was sure to G.O.!
Off panel: G.O. stands for...?
T-Rex: "Genetically obliterate", Utahraptor!
T-Rex (punchline): THERE ARE NO S.U.R.V.I.V.O.R.S.




T-Rex: Interested in sex, but like, from an academic perspective? Like, you don't want to HAVE it, you just want to LEARN about it.
T-Rex: Hah hah hah! Yeah right, bucko!!
T-Rex: But sure. I'LL PLAY ALONG.
Narrator: SEX ED in comic form
Narrator: AS NATURE INTENDED
T-Rex: Okay, so check it: sex is what happens when two people -
Dromiceiomimus: - well, you know... not necessarily, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Oh. OH. Okay, yeah, sex happens when two OR MORE people... wait. I forgot I found out you don't even need another person to have sex!!
T-Rex: I CRACKED THE CODE, you know?
T-Rex: Okay. Sex happens when one or more people do, um... sex?
Utahraptor: Defining sex is hard, huh?
T-Rex: It is! It's obviously not ALL peener-in-cloaca "let's hatch an egg" stuff. You can have sex even if you don't have peeners or cloacas, AND HOW, but with all the stuff folks DO when they have sex, it's kinda hard to define!
Utahraptor: "Something you do that you find sexy"?
T-Rex: DONE.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey ladies, who has no thumbs and can't even come up with a working definition of sex? THIS GUY.
T-Rex: ...Wait, that sounded like I'm bad at it! ATTENTION LADIES!!
T-Rex (punchline): Um, I feel like I could probably figure my way around WHATEVER you got goin' on




T-Rex: Welcome to Utopia City! It's a city where everything is perfect!
T-Rex: So that'll be nice!
Dromiceiomimus: Hey, how did you deal with the jerk problem?
T-Rex: Oh, they're not allowed into Utopia City. Strict "no jerks allowed" policy.
Dromiceiomimus: But what if someone BECOMES a jerk once they're inside?
T-Rex: I guess then... they get kicked out?
Utahraptor: So ANYONE'S place in paradise is precarious, fully dependent on how popular they are.
T-Rex: Uh -
Utahraptor: And what if MY version of paradise includes debating with someone who disagrees with me for fourteen years or so? This doesn't sound like Utopia City to me, T-Rex! This sounds like an AUTHORITARIAN POPULARITY REGIME playing with our VERY LIVES!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Welcome to Utopia City! It's a city where only I am allowed in!!
T-Rex (punchline): ...listen, there's significant upsides




T-Rex: One day Marty McFly - a character that I do NOT have the rights to use - bumped into none other than King Kong, who is another character that I don't own but I'm still making him say and do whatever I want!!
T-Rex: "Great Scott!" King Kong said, correctly!
T-Rex: Marty McFly - who was the version of the character from just before the first movie and who, I hasten to remind you, I have not legally acquired any rights to use - replied that he had only heard "Great Scott" used by his friend Doc Brown - another character that society decided that if I write about him it's a crime but I'm still gonna - and inquired if King Kong had met him.
Utahraptor: You're really going in on how illegal your story is, yeah?
T-Rex: It makes me AND my story cooler!
Utahraptor: It's just - literary theft isn't THAT cool a crime. But check it: plagiarism doesn't exist for REAL LIFE, so if you find someone who lived an awesome life and just copy them, nobody can hold you responsible. And then you'll be rad for REAL!
T-Rex: Oh snap! I CAN PLAGIARIZE REALITY AND GET AWAY WITH IT??
Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex (punchline): Oh snap! UTAHRAPTOR JUST TRICKED ME INTO READING A BUNCH OF BIOGRAPHIES AND TRYING TO LEARN LESSONS I CAN APPLY TO MY OWN LIFE IN ORDER TO PRACTICE SELF-IMPROVEMENT??




T-Rex: Ah yes. Time to go home, relax, unwind, and decompress by pondering many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore!
T-Rex: And I will begin this process at midnight sharp, AS IS MY WONT.
T-Rex: It's how I like to spend ALL my bleak Decembers. And YES, the silken sad uncertain rustling of my purple curtains DOES have the chance of thrilling me while, at the same time, also filling me with fantastic terrors never seen before - but it's a risk I'M willing to take. Just as long as nobody knocks on my door!!
Utahraptor: Plagiarizing Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven, I see!
T-Rex: Aha! I'm NOT!
T-Rex: I'm ADAPTING it for a new format (first person foreshadowy narrative) and, since it's out of copyright, that means NOBODY CAN STOP ME! It's in the PUBLIC DOMAIN!
Utahraptor: Even if your version is objectively worse?
T-Rex: ESPECIALLY if my version is OBJECTIVELY WORSE!!
T-Rex: Which it IS
T-Rex: Because writing is HARD
T-Rex (punchline): And I need to work on my SELF-ESTEEM




Narrator: AN ADVENTURE THROUGH TIME
T-Rex: Oh boy! Today is a good day I think for an adventure through time!
T-Rex: So long, Dromiceiomimus! I'm about to travel back to the age of di- back to long ago!
Dromiceiomimus: So long T-Rex! I hope you don't become your own grandfather!
Utahraptor: Ooh, can I come along on the adventure through time? Please?
T-Rex: Well... okay!
T-Rex: But you have to promise to let ME choose the time period, and you're not allowed to try to set things up so you become king, alright?
Utahraptor: Sure! Fine!
T-Rex: Cause I read your weblog last week, and you were all, "I want to go back in time and set it up so I become king!"
T-Rex: Your current mood was 'kingly'!
T-Rex (punchline): I thought to myself, "T-Rex, you'd better make a note of this!"




Narrator: PICKUP LINES FOR 2020
T-Rex: Girl is your body the news? Because it is unbelievable!
T-Rex: And such that if I described it to someone a decade ago they would not believe me!!
T-Rex: Girl are you democracies around the world, because when I look at you I can feel my foundations crumbling??
Dromiceiomimus: Girl are you the gig economy, because I feel like you'd start out all fun and flirty before making my life and the lives of my friends measurably worse??
Utahraptor: These aren't very good pickup lines.
T-Rex: I know, I know, I'm working on it!
T-Rex: Girl are you YouTube, because -
Utahraptor: - because I'll like AND subscribe! DONE.
T-Rex: - because you'll be fun until you start queuing up alt-right conspiracy videos after everything I watch.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Girl are you Facebook, because you keep getting caught going through my phone without permission to find out who I've been talking to??
Off panel: No, I'm not Facebook, T-Rex.
Off panel (punchline): Though I *am* doing that thing you said; no regrets




T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes, the public domain detective who ruined the name "Sherlock" for everyone else, frowned. It seemed some brute was going around murdering people!
T-Rex: (It's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but don't tell him!)
T-Rex: "This is indeed strangest case I have ever encountered," Sherlock said. (He forgot to say "the", just as the word "The" is missing from the story's original title, "Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"!). Sherlock had used some drugs before out of boredom (drugs transformed Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde, so there's a parallel here which also parallels the "good/evil" conflict in the original story!) but he wasn't using them now.
T-Rex: Sherlock deduced fingerprints were a thing, then arrested the dual man. THE END.
Utahraptor: That's IT?!
Utahraptor: Dude, you were pointing out every literary allusion you made just to be ABSOLUTELY SURE we'd all know how clever you were! It was PAINFUL.
T-Rex: It was ACCESSIBLE! Wow. SNOBBY much??
Utahraptor: ...Sometimes, yeah.
T-Rex: ...
Off panel: ...
Narrator (punchline): "SUDDEN UNEXPECTED HONESTY COMICS"




Narrator: SO THIS IS THE SADDEST PART OF ROBERT SCOTT'S STORY, T-REX.
T-Rex: Getting to the south pole a month late wasn't sad enough?
Narrator: WELL, IN THIS PART, EVERYBODY DIES.
T-Rex: ...Of old age?
Narrator: NOPE: EXPOSURE. THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE AS THE TEMPERATURE DROPS.
T-Rex: What happens?
Narrator: ONE MAN, OATES, IS IN A BAD WAY. RATHER THAN SLOW EVERYONE DOWN, HE GETS UP ONE MORNING, SAYS "I AM JUST GOING OUTSIDE AND MAY BE SOME TIME", AND LEAVES THE TENT. NOBODY EVER SEES HIM AGAIN.
T-Rex: ...Whoah.
T-Rex: Okay! That's it!! I'm tapping out!
Utahraptor: You don't want to hear how this ends?
T-Rex: I know how it ends! EVERYBODY DIES. Amundsen makes it though, right?
Utahraptor: Yeah, his team's better prepared for getting to the pole. Scott was more an adventurer, while Amundsen said "Adventure is just bad planning".
T-Rex: Dude, Why couldn't you tell me his story instead?
Off panel: ...I thought you'd enjoy a story of doomed struggle more than a story of efficient success?
T-Rex: Man, I love efficient success! I'm all about efficient success! You know how I take baths? EFFICIENTLY.
T-Rex (punchline): AND NOT INFREQUENTLY: SUCCESSFULLY




T-Rex: It is a truth universally acknowledged that "Call me Ishmael", as a novel opening, is like a television tuned to a dead channel.
T-Rex: That is to say: it's been done, yo!
T-Rex: Start your novel with "Call me [WHATEVER NAME YOU WANT HERE]" and people are gonna say, "Oh, like Moby Dick. It's like that other book I've heard about." And so the whole opening structure is ruined forever! You can still USE it, sure, but unless you somehow acknowledge Mobes D or play with it or whatever, people are just going to assume you ripped off Melville.
Utahraptor: There's lots of things like this!
T-Rex: Oh, I know!
Utahraptor: For example, I can't consider to being or not to being without people thinking "Oh hey, like from Hamlet".
T-Rex: Right?! The longer our civilization lasts, the more phrases get claimed by famous books, and the fewer words there are left for the rest of us. There can be only one answer:
T-Rex: DESTROY CIVILIZATION??
Off panel: Stop looking for low-hanging fruit, stand on the shoulders of giants, and express ever greater and more nuanced sentiment??
T-Rex (punchline): Uh, DESTROY CIVILIZATION??




T-Rex: There are people today who are famous the world over, and all they did was die!
T-Rex: I refer of course to people like Tollund man or Ötzi the Iceman!
T-Rex: What is Ötzi famous for? Dying and getting frozen in a glacier around 3400 BCE, which preserved his body. And Tollund man died and got tossed in a bog around 300 BCE, which did the same to his bod. Everything we know about them comes from examining their bodies in great scientific detail! And now they're famous and made global headlines when discovered and get to have their bodies on display in museums!!
Utahraptor: So your secret to fame is to die in a way that keeps your body around.
T-Rex: Dude. It DEFINITELY WORKS.
T-Rex: If your body is found by surprise thousands of years in the future then BAM: instant global celebrity! And you don't even have to DO anything. Just make sure YOUR body survives!
Utahraptor: Well - not quite. It has to be rare. Yours has to survive when others don't.
T-Rex: Yes! Only MY body must survive the ages...
Off panel: Hah! When you say that, it sounds like a threat!
T-Rex: Yes... "sounds like"...
T-Rex (punchline): ...a "threat"...




T-Rex: Bodies!
T-Rex: What is their deal, I might ask??
Dromiceiomimus: What's your issue with your body today, T-Rex?
T-Rex: FIRST: thank you for acknowledging that bodies are so baloney that one could have a different issue with them every day indefinitely: I do appreciate it. Second: my issue is that my hand hurts for no reason, so what the heck's going on, my hand??
Utahraptor: Maybe the pain is telling you something is wrong?
T-Rex: That's another thing I have issues with!
T-Rex: Pain from touching a hot stove: that I get! It UNAMBIGUOUSLY says "don't do that". Pain of an undetermined origin - what does that tell me? All it says is "Something's wrong, I dunno, just add that to your list of vague and unfocused worries, right beside 'what if my pals secretly hate me' and 'is that smell me'".
Off panel: ...I like you a lot, bud, but that smell is definitely you.
T-Rex: Oh.
T-Rex (punchline): OH GOD




T-Rex: IN THE FUTURE, travel will involve climbing inside MULTI-TON METAL ROBOTS, who will dutifully carry us to our destination!!
T-Rex: But these robots will be cars instead of building-sized colossuses, due to economics being dumb!!
T-Rex: EVEN SO, it's still going to be rad. And you know why, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Because after over a century of phoning it in, the "auto-mobile" will finally live up to the promise of its name??
T-Rex: YES. Also, we'll be able to play in traffic with IMPUNITY.
Utahraptor: That's something we want to do?
T-Rex: Um, ABSOLUTELY?
T-Rex: Dude, when we can do that safely, it means cars are FINALLY no longer mindless machines ready and willing to kill anyone in their path "by accident", but now COURTEOUS ROBOT PALS with 360° situational awareness and constant predictive processing. And that means street hockey is coming back, baby!
T-Rex (punchline): In other news: YES I want to live inside a robot car, and that is NORMAL




T-Rex: Everyone loves a good science fiction epic! Whether it's a war involving the stars, or a trek involving the stars, people just can't get enough of that stuff!
T-Rex: So anyway here's mine!
T-Rex: Blurrg (orc, basically race of ugly bullies) adjusted the orbital velocity of the XJ-25545 prototype he and his crew had stolen. A'hrarka (night elf, aloof, good at archery but only if it's night) scanned for nearby interceptors. And to her right, D'anny The Bold (dragon/mermaid hybrid, long story, not as interesting as it should be) armed the transphotonic cannons. If the law caught up with them, they might get taken... but it wouldn't be ALIVE.
Utahraptor: This seems like pretty fantasy-inspired scifi, my dude!
T-Rex: Because I JUST FIXED FANTASY.
T-Rex: Turns out all fantasy needed was to put its characters both in space AND a hard science context! Of course, it also needed to finally explore the reproductive morphology of the Ent tree people because MAN that's got to be complicated, but I'm still doing research for that.
T-Rex: But DID YOU KNOW one plant generation reproduces with asexual spores, while the next gen of the SAME SPECIES produces egg and sperm cells, sometimes in the same flower??
Off panel: What the hell, that's awesome!
T-Rex: I KNOW
T-Rex (punchline): FANTASY AUTHORS NEED TO STOP SLEEPING ON THIS




Narrator: COMICS IN WHICH THE MAIN CHARACTER IS TIRED OF PUNS AND SO EVERYBODY DIES
T-Rex: I wonder what the longest word in the dictionary is!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is?
Dromiceiomimus: Hmm... is this a riddle? Is the answer "longest"?
T-Rex: Ha ha, no, this isn't a riddle. It's a real question I'm investigating!
Utahraptor: Ooh! T-Rex! I know the longest word in the dictionary!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: "Smiles"!
T-Rex: "Smiles".
Utahraptor: Because there's a "mile" between the first and last letters!
T-Rex: That's it!
T-Rex (punchline): Everybody dies!




T-Rex: The wheels on the bus go: a) round and round b) to inconvenient bus stops c) hard or go home d) loudly past my house at 3 FRIGGIN' AM
T-Rex: While ALL are correct, the canonically accepted answer is A!
T-Rex: But unlike a bunch of songs for babies, "The Wheels On The Bus" actually has a modern vintage, since it IS, after all, an exhaustive listing of the properties of buses: a technology which did not exist until someone thought "hey, you know what'd make this car better? If it were larger AND filled with strangers"!
Utahraptor: There's no "the legs on the horse go clop clop clop" ancestor?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: Nor is there a "the sails of the trans-Atlantic ship go 'flap flap flap'" version, much less an earlier "the lungs of Fishy J. Bonkers, our earliest ancestor to crawl out of the ocean, go 'gasp gasp gasp'" prototype.
Utahraptor: Well, that's disappointing.
T-Rex: Yep.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE:
Off panel: Well, that's to be expected, here where fish can not only sing, but ALSO ensure that their lyrics and melodies survive for millions of years!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex (punchline): ...I feel KINDA bad about eating them??




God: HEY T-REX REMEMBER WHEN WE STOLE THE KILOGRAM
T-Rex: Sure do!
God: LET'S STEAL SOMETHING ELSE
God: SOMETHING
God: FROM HISTORY
Narrator: LATER:
God: MAN I GOT ARRESTED
Narrator: the end
God: HEY T-REX REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ARRESTED
T-Rex: Sure do!
Utahraptor: Sure do what?
T-Rex: Oh. I, uh, I sure do like that colour on you, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: What? What colour? The colour of my skin? You're saying you like the colour of my skin?
T-Rex: It - uh,
T-Rex: it goes well with your eyes
T-Rex: Man, what's the deal with nobody hearing you but me, God? It's a hassle!
God: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ME GETTING FRIGGIN ARRESTED BACK THERE
God: CAN I CREATE AN OBJECT SO VALUABLE THAT EVEN I CAN'T HEIST IT
God (punchline): IS MY QUESTION




God: T-REX TELL ME A BATMAN STORY
T-Rex: But of course!
T-Rex: One day Batman was fighting the Joker on a giant typewriter!
T-Rex: "This reminds me of some of my previous adventures," Batman thought to himself, while typing out "k you need 2 go 2 jail now" on the keyboard. The giant keys rained punishing blows on the Joker's struggling form!!
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds like Batman's winning!
T-Rex: He was, until the Joker sprayed acid from his lapel flower onto the typewriter!
T-Rex: The acid combined with the exotic metal of the typewriter to produce a strange gas which -
Girl: [small] Batman sucks!!
T-Rex: ...What?
T-Rex: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
Utahraptor: I didn't say anything!
T-Rex: I don't see anyone else here! And SOMEONE just opined Batman to be a sucky dude, A BLATANT AND ACTIONABLE FALSEHOOD!!
Off panel: [small] Batman isn't even as good as a turd in a blanket
Sound effect: *pop*
Sound effect: *pop*
T-Rex (punchline): Ah yes, the familiar sound of my eardrums exploding of their own volition rather than listen to even one more HORRIBLE LIE




Narrator: T-REX THE TALKING DINOSAUR IN:
T-Rex: Is it true that the content of our thoughts - their very meaning - is determined, at least in part, by our environment?
Narrator: SEMANTIC EXTERNALISM COMICS
T-Rex: Okay, suppose I think "I love chocochops", which are of course delicious chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone. And say there's a twin Earth, completely identical - EXCEPT that there, chocochops have a different chemical makeup, but taste and look the same! If my twin thinks "I love chocochops", he's actually referring to the one with CRAZY CHEMICALS, while when I think that, I'm referring to a chemically different object. The environment determines our semantics!
Utahraptor: Ah, the famous "Twin Earth" thought experiment of Hilary Putnam!
T-Rex: SOMEONE CAME UP WITH IT FIRST?
Utahraptor: Yeah, only his example was about water having a different composition on Twin Earth, instead of those hauntingly stupid chocochops you invented. The point is that both thinkers have the exact same mental state but are saying different things, and the environment is responsible for meaning there.
Narrator: EPILOGUE: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX CALLS HIS GRANDMOTHER.
T-Rex: But I don't mention anything about semantic externalism!
T-Rex (punchline): Sometimes I like to call her just to say hello




T-Rex: I am jealous of physicist RICHARD FEYNMAN.
T-Rex: Aaaand here's why!
T-Rex: Dude made a joke about 762nd decimal place of pi! At that point, there's a sequence of six nines in a row, and his joke was that he'd like to memorize pi up to that point, so that when reciting it he could end with "9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9... and so on." Others had noticed it before but FEYNMAN was the first to make a joke about it, and now his joke is encoded into the very fabric of the universe!
T-Rex: In base 10!
Utahraptor: And that makes you irrationally jealous?
T-Rex: Hells yes!
T-Rex: Feynman has a JOKE encoded into pi - transcendental immortality in the circumference of a circle! That's something for the ol' resume, eh?
Utahraptor: I guess!
T-Rex: I'm gonna make my own universal constant joke now, and I'm gonna need you to tell people about it.
T-Rex: So! Why do people start getting afraid at the 2501st digit of e? Because 7 8 9!
T-Rex: There's a sequence of "789" that starts there, and it sounds like "seven ate nine"!
T-Rex (punchline): This is definitely called "T-Rex's Hilarious e Joke", okay?




God: T-REX IT'S TIME TO SET YOU STRAIGHT ABOUT HOW GENDERED NOUNS ARE GOOD
T-Rex: I think it's not! I think it's time for us to eat ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT CHICKEN WINGS.
God: YOU KNOW WHAT
God: OKAY
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I cleaned the chicken sauce off my face really well!
T-Rex: And while doing so I totally looked into gendered nouns! IT TURNS OUT, if you ask people who know both English and German to list the first three adjectives that come to mind when they read the English word "bridge", they'll say things like "beautiful", "slender" and "fragile", and when you ask English/Spanish speakers, they'll come up with words like "big", "strong", and "dangerous". And GUESS WHAT?
Utahraptor: Bridges are women in German and men in Spanish!
T-Rex: Exactly!! Isn't that insane??
T-Rex: The imaginary genders we assign to words colour our perception of them, apparently overloading them with all SORTS of sublimated sexual stereotypes! "Dangerous"? "Fragile"? Are all German women ready at any moment to shatter into a gorgeous explosion of beauty? Are Spanish men all action heroes with nothing left to lose??
T-Rex (punchline): And if so, where do I meet them, because it sounds like they might be fun to pal around with?




T-Rex: Damn you, database! You're a loose cannon! Your CPU usage grows every day and your disk I/O is off the chart!
T-Rex: I should fire you, but instead I'm giving you a raise and recalibrating my charts!
Dromiceiomimus: I said this database was bad news, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I know; I should've listened to you three years and four ulcers ago! But damn it, this database gets results! I've got three upstart databases here that'd LOVE a shot at his job, and not one of them can do in five CPU cycles what he does in three.
Utahraptor: That's a 66% improvement over their efficiency!
T-Rex: I know! That's actually really good!
T-Rex: But I just wish I could trust him to follow the damn rules. He reindexes data AGAINST MY ORDERS at all hours of the night: what's he looking for? What will it take for him to settle down - and if he does, will it cost him his edge? Will I get a more stable server farm but lose my best database in the bargain??
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Oh wait, hah hah, a hardware failure was causing all that reindexing churn and once I swapped out the bad disk and rebuilt the array it stopped and we're good now!
T-Rex (punchline): PHEW, AM I RIGHT??




T-Rex: It occurs to me that democracy is pretty unfair if you're not a dude who's in the majority!
Narrator: DEMOCRACY COMICS
T-Rex: It sucks, because if everyone disagrees with you, then you'll never get anything you want. It's majority rule! MOB rule!
Dromiceiomimus: Well, majority rule is sort of the definition of democracy, T-Rex. Not everyone can get everything they want!
T-Rex: Yeah, but what if the majority decided to be totally racist against you? You're pooched!
Utahraptor: People have worried about this before, my friend!
T-Rex: What do they say?
Utahraptor: Well, what you're worried about is called the "tyranny of the majority", and it's usually countered by the observation that there's at least a push for minority rights being respected in a democracy, since we're all minorities in one way or another.
T-Rex: Right! Like how I'm in a minority because I sometimes like to sleep in on weekends.
Off panel: Actually, I'd say most people like to do that, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Really? Are you serious??
T-Rex (punchline): Have all my years of sleepy shame been for naught?




T-Rex: I am a guy who is not that great a dancer. Ummm...
T-Rex: SORRY, I GUESS??
T-Rex: So I looked into it and it turns out beat deafness is a thing! I could have an ACTUAL BRAIN THING that prevents me from hearing beats, which could ALSO explain several other things, including why I find it so tricky to rock a rhyme that's right on time!!
Dromiceiomimus: That's tricky?
T-Rex: Tricky
Dromiceiomimus: Tricky
T-Rex: Trrrrrrricky
Utahraptor: You're not alone in this, you know!
T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yep! Lots of animals can't detect beats either... including DOGS.
T-Rex: OH MY GOD. This only serves to bring me closer to my ultimate fantasy of BECOMING a dog! If ONLY there were some handy mnemonic to remember this fact??
Utahraptor: *ahem*
Off panel: It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, for doggies!
T-Rex: Doggies
Off panel: Doggies
T-Rex: Doggies
Off panel (punchline): Doggies




T-Rex: You eat dinner and have been rewarded with a fortune cookie. You open it up and it says "HI! GOD HERE. YOU SHOULD BE A DOCTOR."
T-Rex: You freak out and try to leave but you're tripping on many balls!!
T-Rex: I want to make this dream come true, Drotimes! Fortune cookies have for DECADES been offering restrained, generic, feel-good advice which sets me up AMAZINGLY WELL for cookies that offer terrifyingly specific and urgent advice. And you only print them 1 in 5000, so your dining companions all get regular boring "gosh you're lucky!" fortunes while you are LOSING IT!
Dromiceiomimus: So... start a company?
Utahraptor: How about one that simply says "OMEGA PROTOCOL IS GO"?
T-Rex: Oh wow, perfect!
T-Rex: "THEY'RE INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. PAY QUIETLY AND GET OUT"
Utahraptor: "YOUR BODY WILL BE OUR NEST"
T-Rex: "I HAVE THE ANTIDOTE"
Utahraptor: "DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES"
T-Rex: And each crazy fortune is put in the cookie multiple times, so it seems like someone is REALLY trying to get that "MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM IN FIVE MINUTES, COME ALONE" message to you. Tada! The world is instantly more awesome AND terrifying!
T-Rex (punchline): Thank me later, chumps!!




T-Rex: Some people who have weiners describe them as "a grower, not a show-er". It's ALWAYS handy to have a rhyme to help you remember the properties of your own body AND/OR identity!
Narrator: HANDY RHYMES FOR SITUATIONS
Narrator: IN CASE YOU NEED THEM
T-Rex: If you like music but can't play an instrument, tell people you're "a hummer, not a strummer". If you like sports but get winded and need to take breaks, remind all that you're "a sitter, not a quitter!" If you have sex for money but people think you've been slacking off on the job, tell 'em you're "a sex worker, not a sex shirker!"
Dromiceiomimus: That must come up a lot.
T-Rex: YOU'D BE SURPRISED
T-Rex: If you get naked for money but have no desire for fictional people to be dating, you're "a stripper, not a shipper!"
Utahraptor: These are, um... pretty sex-focused?
T-Rex: NO REGRETS!! Incidentally, if people keep trying to make telephone calls using your erection, stress that you've got "a boner, not a phone-er".
T-Rex: THAT'S RIGHT, WALK AWAY!!
T-Rex (punchline): KEEP ACTING LIKE YOU WON'T BE THANKING ME WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ANNOYING PEOPLE MISUSING BONERS AND HAVE THE PERFECT MOT JUSTE




Narrator: SOCIAL MEDIA
Narrator: for seniors
T-Rex: Whoah whoah whoah, hold up!
T-Rex: There is a NOT-UNPROBLEMATIC ASSUMPTION at play here! Not all seniors are so bad at social media that they need a stranger to explain it to them, that poor stranger unaware that they will now forever be CALLED ON THE PHONE by that senior whenever anything goes wrong in the future because they "were the one who put that website on my computer"!!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, your objection is itself not unproblematic!
T-Rex: Gasp!
Utahraptor: Also, as we will either all become seniors one day or LITERALLY DIE TRYING, I think we should start talking them up now. Remember: every senior you see is someone who either KILLED ALL THEIR ENEMIES or learned enough grace to let them live. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS.
T-Rex: DAMN!!
T-Rex (punchline): I, for this one moment that's beginning to fade even as I make my way through this sentence, cannot WAIT to be old!!




Narrator: SORRY I DIDN'T REPLY TO YOUR TEXT MESSAGE FOR LIKE THREE DAYS
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Hah hah, yeah, sorry about that!
T-Rex: Listen, I think we need to acknowledge that there will be times when you text me and I'll think "Wow, THAT'S definitely a text I'll reply to!" but then I'll put my phone down or something distracts me and I completely forget about it for the next three days. Minimum.
Dromiceiomimus: This happens a lot.
T-Rex: The world is a distracting place, FULL OF WONDER or whatever, okay?
Utahraptor: But then all you eventually ever write is "haha"!
T-Rex: ONLY if whatever you sent was funny!
Utahraptor: THREE DAYS, T-Rex. For "haha".
T-Rex: You'd rather I not write back at all? Listen, if you text me, you gotta accept my motto: "TEXTS RULE EVERYTHING AROUND ME
Utahraptor: But that's the oppos-
T-Rex: ...NOT."
Narrator: SORRY I'M NOT A GREAT FRIEND
Narrator: BUT THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS THAT MAKE ME GOOD
Narrator (punchline): try to remember them i guess




T-Rex: Spider-Man was still eating nasty cake. "I am a character owned by another corporation, and you are not a valid licensee" he spat out, along with the cake, which he was already spitting out. It was gross and rude!
T-Rex: Spider-Man was being gross and rude!
T-Rex: Then Spider-Man "webbed" his way out of the room, leaving behind the remains of the cake and webbing, stuck to the ceiling, walls, floors and furniture. "Who's going to clean up THIS fine mess?" asked a member of the custodial staff, and then he said "Hah hah, no, it's me; I know it's me." He liked his job: the satisfaction of seeing progress being made in a task was something that pleased him greatly.
T-Rex: Later that evening, he happily went home to his wife and children!
Utahraptor: This doesn't seem to be going anywhere, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What are you talking about? It started as SUPERHERO CULINARY, and now it's HAPPY CUSTODIAN FAMILY HOUR. Those are the two biggest genres this summer!
Utahraptor: ...Who told you that?
T-Rex: Um, a little thing called TRENDS FORECASTING??
T-Rex: Haha, no, it was a little thing called "write what you know" and ALL I KNOW is endless trains of thought that involve superheroes.
T-Rex: Oh!
T-Rex (punchline): And foodstuffs!!




Narrator: COMPRESSED SONG COMICS today's song POKER FACE by LADY GAGA
T-Rex: Lady Gaga analogizes sex to poker! In the song, I mean!
T-Rex: To hear her tell it, she intends to get her male opponent "hot", and then, she intends to show him "what she's got". She assures us, the audience, now presumably with one raised eyebrow, that this unnamed protagonist (adversary? It is difficult to tell) is fully unable to read her poker face.
Utahraptor: He's unable, he's unable to see past her facade of bluffing!
T-Rex: Fah-fah-fah-facade of bluffing
T-Rex: To proceed: she wants to spend time with him; she believes they'll present an appearance of aloof disinterest. Russian roulette is different if you remove the gun from the endeavor.
Utahraptor: And when it comes to the act of physical love, Lady Gaga becomes bored if it's too tender!!
T-Rex: In conclusion, Lady Gaga repeats her claim of her facade of bluffing being perfect no less than four more times, so it must be true.
Off panel (punchline): Fah-fah-fah-facade of bluffing




T-Rex: When writing was first invented, there were only, like, a handful of books.
T-Rex: Like, one, I guess.
T-Rex: There was a point in time where you could read every book ever written!
T-Rex: Now you can't even read every book CURRENTLY IN PRINT: way too many enter every year! Maybe you could read every book printed in a single year, if you spent your entire life doing it?
Dromiceiomimus: 2.2 million unique titles are printed each year, dude! That's 100 books per day, assuming 60 years of reading! And you'd probably wanna stop reading to bone down on hotties at some point!
T-Rex: Aha! But what if I only read the English ones?
Utahraptor: That's still over 20 books per day.
T-Rex: DANG, Y'ALL.
T-Rex: Well, we're officially creating culture faster than anyone can consume it.
Utahraptor: That's not the worst part. Even if only ONE SINGLE COPY of each of these 2.2 million titles is printed, that's still 2000 CUBIC METERS of space that's now filled with book.
Off panel: People are always SO DOWN on burning books but they forget that a dude needs space for like, crops and junk!
T-Rex: This madness must end! TO THE LIBRARY!!
T-Rex (punchline): (VIA THE TORCH STORE)




T-Rex: I am a guy who likes to keep his hopes and dreams SECRET. This is because, if I fail to achieve them, then only I know that I screwed up!
T-Rex: Works for me!
T-Rex: It's like, say I tell everyone I want to be an astronaut, right? And then now it's 20 years later and I'm not an astronaut and it's some stupid "what have you done with your life" reunion and everyone's like "HEY T-REX, HOW'S THE ASTRONAUT LIFESTYLE? IS IT - IS IT PRETTY ACHIEVABLE?"
T-Rex: I'd much rather they say, "What did T-Rex say he wanted to be? I can't recall! I bet it's what he is now, though."
Utahraptor: But everyone wanted to be an astronaut!
T-Rex: Perhaps!
T-Rex: But not everyone wanted to, say, be in a committed relationship and own a house before they were 25.
Utahraptor: Hah! YOU wanted that?
T-Rex: SEE? SEE? This is why I keep my hopes and dreams to myself.
Narrator: SECRETLY:
T-Rex: [thinks] it would be great if one day i rode in a hot air balloon and threw down candy at people so they liked me more
T-Rex: [thinks] aw, who am i kidding?
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] folks will just make fun




T-Rex: If I'm ever taken hostage and am forced to do things UNDER DURESS, I'm gonna need a new code phrase! The old one involving chicken husbandry was way too hard.
T-Rex: Okay. Chicken husbandry ITSELF was way too hard. Anyway.
T-Rex: I still TOTALLY need to let people know I'm acting against my will!
Dromiceiomimus: Well if you're talking to us, you COULD casually mention that, incidentally and by-the-bye, you would very much hate being held hostage at the old abandoned slipper factory.
T-Rex: That's too transparent, Dromiceiomimus.
T-Rex: Man!
T-Rex: ESPECIALLY if that's where I'm being held!!
Utahraptor: So let's decide on a phrase you can use: something you'd never say normally!
T-Rex: And which ALSO sounds casual!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Okay, it's settled. "Five essential moisturizing oils" means "call the friggin' cops, please!"
Utahraptor: Got it.
T-Rex: Excellent! Man! Life just got interesting for us, Utahraptor!!
Narrator: LATER STILL: T-REX DOESN'T ACTUALLY EVER GET KIDNAPPED
T-Rex: But I did go through life without ever saying "five essential moisturizing oils"!
T-Rex (punchline): Kinda have to count that as a win!




T-Rex: One day the king and queen had a baby named "Oedipus", and they were like, hey, great time for a prophecy! I wonder what the future for this kid holds! Wow, can't wait to find out!
Narrator: THE STORY OF OEDIPUS REX
T-Rex: So they go to a prophet and the prophet says "K, this baby is deffo going to kill his dad and marry his mom" and the king and queen were like, WHOA, definitely NOT what we expected. They were going to give the baby up for adoption, but the Queen said "Wait, what if he grows up and accidentally kills you mistaking you for a beggar, then solves the Riddle of the Sphinx thereby becoming king, at which point he marries me?"
Utahraptor: It was too much to risk?
T-Rex: It was WAY too much to risk!
T-Rex: So instead they killed the baby, which was murder, but they were king and queen in history times so nobody really cared - plus, by doing so they were preventing both a future murder AND an incest, so although the ethics of precrime are complicated, it certainly seemed at least ARGUABLY justifiable. THE END.
T-Rex: P.S.: thousands of years later, the story of Oedipus became a cultural shorthand, a metaphor for how complex the ethics of precrime are.
Off panel: How complex are they?
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
T-Rex (punchline): They're Oedipal complex!!




T-Rex: Names are pretty arbitrary! Your parents pick whatever sounds good to them, and then you're stuck with it for the rest of your life!
T-Rex: Unless you change your name, and that's equally arbitrary!
T-Rex: And if you're named after someone, that's just a tradition of REPEATED arbitrariness. And when you add in all the towns and cities and natural landmarks named after people, that only increases the arbitrariness!
T-Rex: All names are random and could've easily ended up differently!
Utahraptor: Well, some places are named after features, like "Lake Placid".
T-Rex: But WORDS are arbitrary too!
T-Rex: There's no relation between the MEANING of the word "placid" and the sound your mouth makes when you say it! Therefore, you MUST admit that all language sounds are essentially MEANINGLESS and therefore RANDOM!
Utahraptor: Okay, fine! I accept your argument!
T-Rex: [thinks] Little does Utahraptor know he's just irrevocably conceded the possibility that there's a parallel universe where instead of "Smith", the most common name is "Pooplord Junior"!
T-Rex (punchline): Thank you; no further questions




T-Rex: As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous, verminous meme.
T-Rex: Everything he said was in all-caps Impact font.
T-Rex: He could almost see his numerous image macros waving helplessly before his eyes!
T-Rex: "NOT SURE IF REAL LIFE", he thought, then he imagined a picture of Fry from Futurama squinting a little, then he completed the thought with "OR A DREAM". It was no dream. His room, a regular bedroom, only rather too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. He struggled to get out of bed. "AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE" he said, then pictured Walter from The Big Lebowski with a gun, "WHO CAN'T GET OUT OF BED??"
Utahraptor: "TURNED INTO MEME", he said, thinking of Bad Luck Brian, "AND ISN'T SUCCESS KID".
T-Rex: Precisely!
T-Rex: His mother knocks to tell him he's late and he shouts "I DON'T ALWAYS MISS WORK / [Dos Equis guy] / BUT WHEN I DO, I HAVE A GOOD REASON" and it's close enough to how he normally talks that she doesn't suspect he's a meme now.
Utahraptor: How tragic! How monstrous! I can't wait to read 200 more pages of this!!
God: T-REX I LIKE THIS IDEA SO I WILL NOW SEND IT THROUGH TIME AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE
T-Rex: The greatest compliment!
God: WHILE ALSO MAKING IT NON-TERRIBLE
T-Rex (punchline): ...yeah. Yeah, that's fair actually.




T-Rex: Mylings are Scandinavian ghosts! They're way better than regular ghosts, you guys!
T-Rex: They're the ghosts of cheezed-off kids!
T-Rex: They're cheezed-off ghost kids who just want to be buried properly. And if you encounter one, it hops on your back and demands to be taken to the nearest graveyard. And as you approach the graveyard they grow heavier and heavier, until they're so heavy that you can sink into the ground under their weight. And if that happens then they kill you in a rage and try again with the next guy!
T-Rex: AWESOME.
Utahraptor: What's awesome? It's awesome to be dead?
T-Rex: Man, who knows?!
T-Rex: But what IS awesome is the idea of a ghost who just wants to be buried, but who, despite this one consuming desire, also can't resist pulling the old "increasing mass piggyback ride" prank.
Utahraptor: I get the sense you empathize with these ghosts a lot.
T-Rex: Oh man, I totally do!
T-Rex: If I could increase my mass, you can bet I'd be going for gag piggyback rides ALL THE TIME! As it stands though, all I can do is eat fruit from passing trees DURING the ride.
Off panel: I see.
T-Rex (punchline): Yeah, it definitely takes too long




T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for fixing my life! I'll do it by putting out a new, less controversial book: "LOLITA III: This Time, She's 30".
T-Rex: Nobody can argue with that!!
T-Rex: In my story there's a new Lolita, and she's thirty, and she goes out with a man who's also thirty and from a similar economic and social background! They get married and have some okay times. Years later, all the characters die of old age!
Dromiceiomimus: It seems a bit - conservative!
T-Rex: I could make some changes! But did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though?
Narrator: THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED:
Utahraptor: T-Rex, your new book is basically terrible!
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: I'm serious! The "new Lolita" has nothing to do with the old one, and nothing interesting happens except when "LoHEta" shows up, explains that he's the new manly male Lolita, and then leaves the narrative entirely.
T-Rex: He shows up again in the epilogue! Utahraptor! You didn't even finish my book!!
T-Rex: At the end, Loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace "she" with "he" and "hers" with "definitely his" in the ORIGINAL Lolita, you can read all about his adventures!
T-Rex (punchline): It's called "setting up a spinoff"; look it up?




God: TIME TO TELL PEOPLE SOME EMBARRASSING SECRETS T-REX
T-Rex: Aw man, I don't want to tell anyone my few remaining embarrassing secrets! Come on.
God: SERIOUSLY IT'LL BE A HOOT
T-Rex: No!
God: DUDE COME ON TELL PEOPLE YOUR EMBARRASSING SECRETS
God: IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN
God: FOR ME
God: GOD
T-Rex: Okay! Okay, FINE. I'll tell ONE embarrassing secret and that's it!
T-Rex: But all you're getting is one secret, no more!
Utahraptor: Who's getting a secret?
T-Rex: Apparently, you are! And the secret is this: when I lost my virginity, I had the song "Tubthumping" by Chumbawamba stuck in my head the entire time. I just really liked the song. I remember being afraid I'd hum it afterwards!
Utahraptor: Hahahah! You get knocked down, but you get up again!
T-Rex: Now don't go around telling that secret to anyone else, okay?
Off panel: I already sent it out over the news wires!
T-Rex (punchline): THAT WAS SO IMPROBABLY FAST!




T-Rex: It is 100 years from when you last fell asleep! Just like Rip Van Winkle, you fell asleep and slumbered... FOR A HUNDRED YEARS!! Everyone you knew is probably dead!!
T-Rex: And your body is ruined and unsalvageable!!
T-Rex: While you ARE technically "alive", your muscles have atrophied to the point of non-existence, and your body is so old as to be - and I am speaking objectively here - completely useless. About the only thing your body WAS good at was sleeping, but you're awake now, so you're not even doing THAT right anymore.
Utahraptor: Is all hope lost for me?
T-Rex: Not quite!
T-Rex: There's always the chance that, if you fall asleep AGAIN, you might wake up another hundred years in the future, perhaps in an era in which science has figured out how to make sucky bodies cool and good again.
Utahraptor: I'll take it! Also I open several investments and interest earning bank accounts.
T-Rex: You wake up in 100 years, and everyone you know is DEFINITELY dead! You are, however, rich AND muscley. I can tell you more about your sweet muscles now if you'd like.
Off panel: Oh!
Off panel (punchline): Yes please




T-Rex: The best way to revenge yourself on an animal is to eat it.
T-Rex: Everyone knows it but they leave it to ME to say it out loud!
T-Rex: And this is the problem with vegetarians!! If a cow sasses me, I can say "Oh yeah? Well guess what, wise guy?! I will use your flesh for digestive energy." But vegetarians just take it! And then cows have no idea who they can get away with sassing, and let's face it they're not the smartest pickles in the fountain, so they sass EVERYONE and then I end up eating a lot of beef.
T-Rex: It's not that big a problem.
Utahraptor: I find it doubtful that you've ever revenged yourself on animals in such a way!
T-Rex: You haven't?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, it's SO SATISFYING. You're like "My feelings are hurt, but soon I'll be full of meat. Wow, I feel better already!!"
Utahraptor: What, you hang around farms and wait for some imagined insult?
T-Rex: Okay, you're coming with me and we're going to sneak onto a farm.
Narrator: 45 MINUTES LATER:
T-Rex: HOLY CRAP SHEEP HAVE RECTANGULAR PUPILS!!
T-Rex: WHAT THE HELL WHAT THE HELL
T-Rex (punchline): AHHHHH




T-Rex: Guess who had a bike accident yesterday morning! If you guessed "Shit! T-Rex?" you are correct!!
T-Rex: Also, you shouldn't swear!
T-Rex: But it was me. I was biking and a dog darted in front of me and I guess it turns out I'm not a guy who will run over a dog! I'll run over a squirrel no problem but I swerve and slam on my brakes and go over the handlebars of my bike to avoid hitting a dog.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, I've always wondered: how do you ride a bike with your tiny ar-
T-Rex: I get them custom made, DROMICEIOMIMUS.
Utahraptor: So you swerved to avoid a dog and were thrown from your bike, going over the handlebars.
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: So where are the cuts? You should have at least a little road rash.
T-Rex: They're all, um, on my opposite side right now. The side you can't see.
Utahraptor: So turn around!
T-Rex: Hello! I am late for an appointment! Also, I don't have to listen to you!!
Narrator: SUDDEN DEPRESSING ENDING COMICS!
T-Rex: There are no scratches! Alright?
T-Rex: I - I just...
T-Rex (punchline): I wanted to be the guy that swerved




T-Rex: My stars, am I ever enamoured with sign language. You can speak with your hands! That's amazing!
God: I LOVE SIGN LANGUAGE TOO
T-Rex: Well! Then it's settled!
T-Rex: I think the coolest thing about ASL, which is the sign language I know, is how you can place nouns in space. If I'm telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend, I can make the sign for "dog" to my left, and "friend" to my right, and then when I want to apply adjectives to them, I just sign "angry" or "sassy" in the same physical space as the nouns! You can have nouns FLOATING AROUND YOU in conversation. How is that not the best thing EVER?
T-Rex: Also, many of the signs are really evocative, so they're easy to remember!
Utahraptor: Like what?
T-Rex: Like - the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow, and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child. For children you pat several heads!
Utahraptor: Neat!
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex (punchline): Um - I have nothing bad to say about sign language, the end!




T-Rex: I have been thinking of registering a domain name...
T-Rex: ... on the Internet!
T-Rex: This domain name will have to be something that reflects me and my interests!
T-Rex: Something that says, "This is an awesome dude!" but also says "You should sign the guestbook!"
T-Rex: Hmm...
Utahraptor: I've got a great domain name for you!
T-Rex: Oh boy! What is it?
Narrator: AS THE UTAHRAPTOR GIVES HIS SUGGESTION, THE T-REX'S FACE FILLS WITH EXCITEMENT...
T-Rex (punchline): That's perfect!




T-Rex: It's Wednesday! Come with me on a JOURNEY OF EDUCATION as we learn how movies are made!!
T-Rex: Movies are made by film cameras and other advanced technology!
T-Rex: With the right technology, a robot can be programmed to point a video camera at other robots doing something interesting, and a computer program can be designed to automatically choose the most interesting shots and cut them up into a major motion picture, exploding onto the screens at a cinema near you!!
T-Rex: And THAT'S how movies are made!
Utahraptor: Funny, I thought directors and actors were usually involved!
T-Rex: Why?
T-Rex: Why involve FALLIBLE TALKING MEAT when we have robots, programmed to be infallible, also not to be meat?
Utahraptor: I guess PROBABLY because we don't have such robots.
T-Rex: Hey, here's an INCREDIBLE fact: go on any set, yell "Robots, ENGAGE OMEGA DIRECTIVE ALPHA!", and the director will love you for life!!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): Here's a credible fact: I have never been near a movie set in my life




T-Rex: Oh man, I ate too much last night.
T-Rex: Ooooh man!
T-Rex: I had SO much food, Dromiceiomimus. I thought I'd be smart and cook enough food for lunch the next day, but then I ate it all.
Dromiceiomimus: G-great?
T-Rex: Ooooh man!
Utahraptor: Hey, here's a friendly tip: you shouldn't try to impress women by bragging about how much you can eat!
T-Rex: Dude! I wasn’t trying to IMPRESS her; I was just relaying an amusing anecdote from my own recent history!
Utahraptor: Amusing?
T-Rex: Yeah, I ate a lot!
T-Rex: Ha ha!
Narrator: YEARS LATER, A PARTY:
T-Rex: So I thought I'd cook enough for the next day as well!
Off panel: I'm not impressed!
T-Rex (punchline): Not YET! But, allow me to continue...




Narrator: HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT
T-Rex: Exercise more, eat fewer foods, and enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle!
Narrator: NOW LET'S ASSUME THAT'S ALL BORING AND STUPID
T-Rex: Oooh, let's!!
T-Rex: What we need is a BETTER way to lose weight. And I'm no scientician, but I'm PRETTY SURE when you cry you're squirting matter out of your face. Matter which, I remind you, according to science MUST HAVE MASS AND THEREFORE WEIGHT HERE ON EARTH??
Dromiceiomimus: You propose we lose weight by genetically altering our bodies so we cry fat instead of water?
T-Rex: I was just gonna say we should cry all the time. That's way better!!
Utahraptor: But why stop there? Why not sweat grease instead, so hot days make us skinnier AND tastier-smelling?
Utahraptor: Why not change our skin cells to be replaced faster, so we'll constantly lose weight by leaving gross dust clouds of dead skin flakes everywhere we go? WHY NOT ALLOW OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE IN "FULL REVERSE", EXTRACTING NUTRIENTS FROM OUR OWN BODIES SO THAT WE MIGHT VOMIT UP PERFECTLY GOOD CHEESEBURGERS?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Are these questions rhetorical, or are you actually asking me reasons why we shouldn't do this?
T-Rex (punchline): Because dude, I am comin' up EMPTY HANDED over here




T-Rex: HeLa cells are a strain of cancer cells that, unlike regular body cells, can live indefinitely outside the body, grow very quickly, and don't die from old age. They are used in labs worldwide and are in many ways an independent organism!
T-Rex: They also helped in the research that eradicated polio!
T-Rex: So not only are HeLa cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings (going from a multi-celled life form to a single-celled one) but they're also maybe a first example of immortality: her cells live, but the woman from whom the cells were taken, Henrietta Lacks, died from this cancer in 1951. That's crazy!
T-Rex: Crazier: there's probably a greater mass of HeLa cells now than there was of Henrietta when she was alive!
Utahraptor: Yeah!
Utahraptor: The whole thing is so surreal, don't you think? The woman made a huge contribution to science just by getting sick. And imagine a new species EVOLVING from your body?
T-Rex: Well, Henrietta never found out. She was never even told that the cells were being cultivated!
T-Rex: And with that, I exhaust all my knowledge of Henrietta and HeLa cells. I am well and truly tapped.
Off panel: The cells are called "helacyton gartleri".
T-Rex: AW MAN!! I totally knew that one!
T-Rex (punchline): Also: learning is not a competition?




T-Rex: I have heard of the perfect way for one, and all of one's friends, to instantly appear to be the classiest group of people ever!
Narrator: HOW TO APPEAR TO BE CLASSY
T-Rex: The secret is the HANDSHAKE. If you greet all of your friends with a handshake, then, WITHOUT FAIL, people will start commenting on how classy you are!
T-Rex: This is going to be great!
T-Rex: And when people do compliment me on my classiness, I'll shake their hand!
Utahraptor: I think you may be on to something!
T-Rex: I do believe I am!
T-Rex: But you didn't shake my hand just now. It is LESS classy to run up behind someone shouting than to give them a firm handshake!
Utahraptor: Oops! My mistake. I'll shake your hand right now! Ready?
T-Rex: Ready!
Off panel: Okay, hold out your arm!
T-Rex (punchline): Ha ha! Here I go!




T-Rex: ALL ABOARD THE MAKEOUT EXPRESS! YOUR TICKET IS MAKEOUTS. PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKETS READY.
T-Rex: AND YES, I WILL BE CHECKING TICKETS! VERY CAREFULLY. WITH MY FACE
T-Rex: I WILL ALSO BE USING THE SLICK MOISTENED TONGUE INSIDE MY FACE TO CHECK TICKETS, SO HEADS UP ON THAT ONE.
Dromiceiomimus: Dude, you're making the Makeout Express ticket validation procedure sound needlessly gross!
T-Rex: ATTENTION PASSENGERS: MY TONGUE IS NOT ACTUALLY THAT MOIST
Dromiceiomimus: That's not helping!!
Utahraptor: What stops does the makeout express make?
T-Rex: I'M GLAD YOU ASKED!
T-Rex: THE MAKEOUT EXPRESS TAKES ON PASSENGERS AT KISSFACE STATION, ALL UP ONS CIRCLE, AND LIPLOCK LANE.
Utahraptor: I'd actually prefer to be the only "passenger"!
T-Rex: SORRY BUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SERVICE FOR THOUSANDS OF PAYING CUSTOMERS EACH DAY.
T-Rex: WAIT, THAT MEANS SOMEHOW I'VE BECOME... AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PROSTITUTE??
T-Rex (punchline): EVERYONE GET OFF THE TRAIN, I GOTTA FIGURE THIS OUT




God: T-REX LET'S ASSUME THAT SOMEHOW YOU WILL NEVER DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES
T-Rex: I hope that by "assume" you mean "make it so" SO MUCH that I'm going to pretend that's what you said! Immortality, here I come!
God: THAT'S STILL NOT IMMORTALITY DUDE
T-Rex: Impossible!
God: NO YOU'RE STILL MORTAL THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOU WON'T DIE FROM YOUR BODY GETTING OLD INSTEAD EVERYTHING AROUND YOU WILL BE TRYING TO KILL YOU
God: YOU KNOW
God: ACCIDENTS AND WHAT NOT
T-Rex: Hah! I'm PRETTY SURE I can avoid tripping down the stairs if it means LIVING FOREVER.
Utahraptor: Pretty sure I can prove you can't!
T-Rex: Pretty sure I can get a book on how to hold the handrail!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, forever is INFINITY LONG. Even if you're super careful and have only a 1 in 10 trillion chance of dying on the stairs, how often can you expect that happens if you live, oh, I don't know, 10 TRILLION YEARS?
T-Rex: O-Once?
Utahraptor: And if you live INFINITY YEARS, the chance of you dying from it becomes 1: TOTAL CERTAINTY.
Off panel: With an infinite natural lifespan, the chance you die of ANYTHING rises to 1. Literally the entire universe will kill you, if you give it enough time.
T-Rex: That means if I live long enough YOU'LL kill me too! Oh man!!
T-Rex (punchline): This friendship just got... DANGEROUS




T-Rex: You wake up as a spooky mummy! Whoah. Looks like you got mummified, but now you're alive again, as tends to go in these cases
Narrator: THE SPOOKY MUMMY (YOU)
Narrator: a choose-your-own-adventure adventure
T-Rex: If you want to walk around with your arms outstretched, stop reading and go do that. If that is honestly a priority for you right now then I'm not going to stop you. But if you want to explore how you're alive, given the fact you a) already died once and b) your flesh has become desiccated, let's get down to it. Let's do this. Let's unwrap one of your fingers.
Dromiceiomimus: Turn to panel 4 to unwrap a finger!
Utahraptor: The flesh underneath is stretched and brittle and dry!
T-Rex: This is crazy!
Utahraptor: You flex it, experimentally, and somehow it holds together. How is this possible? Your internal organs are either removed or dried out into uselessness, and that includes your brain. None of this makes sense.
T-Rex: Who cares?! You've got a second chance at life! Turn to panel 6 to live life to its fullest!!
T-Rex: In living life to its fullest, you have somehow turned into me: T-Rex! NICELY DONE. I'm still in control of what I do though, so SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW!!
T-Rex: ...'Kay
T-Rex (punchline): Now I'm gonna go browse the internet for a bit




T-Rex: Okay, T-Rex, you've got a first date tonight. If there's a romantic moment and she looks into your eyes, don't lock eyes with her and whisper "boners"!!
T-Rex: Don't whisper "boners" don't whisper "boners" don't whisper "boners"
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: DANG IT, DROMICEIOMIMUS, I WHISPERED "BONERS"
T-Rex: I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY
T-Rex: AND IT WAS,
T-Rex: BUT LIKE,
T-Rex: NOT TO HER??
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON ANOTHER DATE!!
Utahraptor: T-Rex!
T-Rex: I KNOW
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: IT HAPPENED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME SHE WAS INTO IT
Utahraptor: COOL
T-Rex: YEAH
T-Rex: ANYWAY I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK; THE DATE IS ONGOING
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: THE TRUTH OF LIFE IS THIS NO MATTER WHO YOU KISS
T-Rex (punchline): THEY LIKE THE JOKES YOU'VE SAID: THAT'S SOMEONE YOU SHOULD WED




Narrator: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT STAR TREK
T-Rex: Three facts are all you need, and you'll be able to bluff your way through every conversation!
T-Rex: But you'll ESPECIALLY be able to bluff your way through Star Trek related conversations!
T-Rex: Okay, fact one: Geordi is an extremely competent but underrated character, fact two: the movies focus too heavily on attacks on Earth and not enough on exploration, and fact three: you can make up your favourite episode and it's been done. Just say "Ah yes, my favourite episode is the one where they" and then pick a premise. Get turned into children? Chop off a head and sent it back in time? Hung out with aliens who were actually NOT REALLY ALIENS??
Utahraptor: Okay, so how many times on Star Trek have they gone back in time?
T-Rex: Depends on what you mean!
T-Rex: Are we including the movies - movies which, I MIGHT ADD, focus too heavily on attacks on Earth?
Utahraptor: Sure.
T-Rex: Well! I suppose THAT depends on whether or not we're including episodes featuring that competent Geordi fellow.
Narrator: NEXT TIME ON DINOSAUR COMICS: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY STAR WARS RELATED CONVERSATION
T-Rex: Um... "George Lucas ruined everything?"
Off panel: OH MY GOD!
Off panel (punchline): I KNOW




Narrator: COMICS FOR HETEROSEXUAL MEN today's comic: DUDES! I TOTALLY GAVE THE CHICKS SOME TIPS
T-Rex: Dudes: that is correct!
T-Rex: I have used my "in" with the ladies to spread around some tips!
T-Rex: I told them that we like birthdays and cool presents and when they are nice. Now chicks will know what we like! I know there are some men out there who would have preferred I'd given more SALACIOUS tips, like "how to please a man in the milieu of the bed-room", but that is ridiculous. Here is how you please a man in the milieu of the bed-room: I DUNNO, MAYBE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WILL DO THE TRICK??
Utahraptor: Man, that's reverse sexism!
T-Rex: Nope, just regular sexism!
Utahraptor: Okay but still, it's spreading the idea that all men care about is sex and that they're unable or unwilling to distinguish between sex good and bad.
T-Rex: It's a joke that plays off gender stereotypes! Here, I'll prove it via the scientific method... OF ASKING RANDOM MEN WHAT THEY THINK!
T-Rex: Excuse me! Male pedestrians?
Multiple off-panel voices: What's up?
T-Rex: Would you say you can distinguish between good and bad sex?
Multiple off-panel voices: HECK no! We're terrible at that!
Off panel (punchline): me in particular!!




T-Rex: You know what the most common element in the universe is? Friggin' hydrogen!
T-Rex: But after that, it's totally helium!
T-Rex: And this is why helium balloons are so awesome. Not only are they FUN and FLOATY and COME IN A VARIETY OF COLOURS, but we never have to feel bad about them, because helium is the one resource we'll never run out of!
Dromiceiomimus: Uh, T-Rex, that's not exactly true!
T-Rex: Uh, Dromiceiomimus, I'd be really surprised if we somehow used up the second-most common element in the UNIVERSE.
Utahraptor: It may be common across the universe, T-Rex, but it's not common here on Earth!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Helium's so light that once it's in the atmosphere, it actually ends up escaping into space. We get new helium by mining it out of natural gas reserves, but those are decidedly finite!
T-Rex: Man!! Kids with helium balloons were the last thing I could enjoy WITHOUT thinking how finite everything is!
T-Rex: You know what's left now? Rocks! The only thing I'm sure we'll never run out of is friggin' ROCKS.
T-Rex (punchline): Woooo




T-Rex: Britannic was Titanic's sister ship! After Titanic sank, they upgraded her to make her MORE SINKPROOF. But before she could begin transatlantic service, the Great War broke out and she was converted into a GIANT FLOATING HOSPITAL.
T-Rex: And it was as a hospital ship that she struck a mine and sank!
Dromiceiomimus: That's true, T-Rex, but she sank for very different reasons than the Titanic. Despite the huge hole in her side, she could've remained afloat and motionless, if it weren't for the fact that nurses had opened portholes on the lower decks to get a breeze! Water flooded in as soon as the ship listed. As much as the Titanic is a symbol for hubris, the Britannic is a symbol of how SHIT GOES FOUL sometimes no matter how well you plan.
T-Rex: INTERESTING.
Utahraptor: The ship sank only a few miles from shore, didn't she?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: The captain actually gave the order to gun the engines and beach the ship on the shore, but some lifeboats were launched against orders, two of which ended up DRIFTING INTO THE PROPELLERS, with pretty much the results you'd expect.
Utahraptor: Holy smokes.
T-Rex: Yeah.
Narrator: THE MORAL OF THE STORY:
T-Rex (punchline): Shit certainly DOES go foul sometimes, you guys




T-Rex: In some comics when a character is confused, rather than saying anything in particular, they just say a question mark.
T-Rex: I love that shit!
T-Rex: I mean, I love that STUFF. I love that they have the ability to be so confused that the only response is a question mark, the essence of pure confusion. Sometimes they also speak with the essence of pure exclamation, and at others, with the essence of pure ellipsis.
T-Rex: Anyway, this is a skill I've developed in real life!
Utahraptor: How? I don't know how you'd even pronounce a question mark.
T-Rex: Check it out, buddy!
T-Rex: questionmark!
Utahraptor: Hey, you know what's weak? Saying "question mark" really fast.
T-Rex: Hold on, I can do this! Okay.
T-Rex: $
T-Rex: Oh my God!! I'd never actually pulled it off before! That was amazing!
Off panel: It sounded like the sound dogs make when they're just about to throw up.
T-Rex (punchline): $$$$$




T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes, who we all already deduced was the world's greatest detective, frowned. He was faced with a new crime! And it was a crime unlike any he'd seen before. This crime...
T-Rex: ...was a COMPUTER CRIME.
T-Rex: Yes, computers had been invented ahead of schedule and now Sherlock had to figure them out. Apparently SOMEONE had added an IP tunnel to the police's VPN and had installed a deadman's switch to hold their data ransom! Sherlock frowned again. There were a lot of words in that last sentence that he didn't even know. He needed to learn about hacking and computers, STAT.
T-Rex: What was an integer, and what did it matter if it overflowed?
Utahraptor: Also, was that bad? It sounds bad.
T-Rex: People made a lot of noise about computers being logical machines and Sherlock's mind being logical too, so this should be easy, but it wasn't. Sherlock didn't have the knowledge to even BEGIN approaching a solution to this problem. It required years of study just to get a solid theoretical grounding!
T-Rex: By that time, of course, the police had long since paid off their anonymous criminal and recovered their data.
T-Rex: To this day Sherlock enjoys making little computer programs for fun.
T-Rex (punchline): THE END.




T-Rex: Petey-O, who was a failed writer and not JUST because of his name, stared at his computer screen in frustration. This was his last chance. If he didn't write a great story, TODAY... then he would lose EVERYTHING.
T-Rex: Suddenly, words began to appear on the screen!
T-Rex: Petey-O looked around the coffeeshop he was in. Nobody was reacting. He looked at the keyboard. He definitely wasn't typing on his laptop. There was only one explanation: there was a higher force in the universe, and it was taking pity on him! He stared in joy as the words began. "Once upon a time," he read as the words appeared one by one, "there was a -"
Utahraptor: "uninformed computer user who had allowed overseas scammers to take control of his machine."
T-Rex: OH NO
Utahraptor: "Send us $600 in the next half hour," the words demanded, "or we will delete all your files".
T-Rex: Well FRIG, Utahraptor. "GUESS THERE'S NO MAGIC, JUST STRANGERS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE," said Petey-O, slamming the laptop shut. "OH WELL, NOW IT'S TIME FOR OL' PETEY-O TO DIE".
Off panel: Wait, T-Rex! "Later on, Petey-O and the hacker fell in love and worked together on a novel about their relationship... called '(A)bort, (R)etry... (L)OVE??'"
T-Rex: PETEY-O IS SAVED!!
T-Rex (punchline): TITLE COULD USE SOME WORK THOUGH




T-Rex: Is it Friday? That's great, because Friday is a good day for secrets, and it's the BEST day for
Narrator: SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
T-Rex: This one's for humans only! When a human has a baby, it travels through one of them human birth canals, and then doctors measure and weigh and clean baby up, and then bring thon back to the mom. They'll also give the baby eye ointment! But why would a child need eye meds right after birth?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe they have dry eye dise-
T-Rex: STDs. They're for STDs, Dromiceiomimus. You know: gonorrhea, chlamydia. The usual!
Utahraptor: It's so the babies don't get them?
T-Rex: It's so the babies don't GO TOTALLY BLIND.
T-Rex: These STDs are bacteria, and if baby gets 'em in the eye, bad things can happen! It's just a precaution. Mom can carry them and be asymptomatic, so better safe than sorry!
Utahraptor: But isn't that terrible symbolism? "Mom is dirty and cannot be trusted; baby must be sterilized NOW no matter how clean Mom says she is"
T-Rex: Oh man, that reminds me!! If there's one thing I never ever want to do in my life, it's get involved in an argument about birthing politics!
T-Rex (punchline): Hah hah hah PHEW good thing I remembered




T-Rex: There are a lot of problems in the world! Someone ought to do something.
T-Rex: Wait a second!
T-Rex: I'M someone!!
T-Rex: Okay Dromiceiomimus, I'M going to do something about all the problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Great attitude, T-Rex! And I'm sure people already working on problems will appreciate the help. Which problem(s) are you going to focus on?
T-Rex: Uh... all of them?
Utahraptor: Might help to focus on one or two of them.
T-Rex: Of COURSE! Utahraptor - that's IT!
T-Rex: There's BILLIONS of people alive right now, and surely - SURELY - there's not actually BILLIONS of problems. If everyone take one problem each and solve it, then it won't be a lick of work! And then we could have this licked lickety-split!
Off panel: Great, I'll take solving the problem of world hunger!
T-Rex: And I'll take our sudden overuse of lick-based idioms! It doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'm sure I can lick it into shape!
T-Rex (punchline): OH NO, IT'S GETTING WORSE




T-Rex: Hi! I've decided maybe I should make some new friends after all. But I have a question!
T-Rex: How do you even make friends as an adult??
T-Rex: It's like, there's this guy I've seen around and he's funny and great and we like the same stuff and I just know we could be great friends. But how do I engage this guy? Do I just walk up to this nearly complete stranger and say "Hey, you don't know me but I've been thinking about you a lot and I really think we should, you know... BE TOGETHER?"
T-Rex: "UM, AS PALS??"
Utahraptor: Don't dating sites have "just friends" options?
T-Rex: Man I don't want rando friends! I want HIM.
Utahraptor: Well my usual advice would be "just be yourself and don't make things weird", but since this is you... what if we bet whichever one of us makes friends with this guy LAST has to pay the winner $500??
T-Rex: Oh my god YOU'RE ON, BUDDY!!
[email message]
Email: [playful 3D font] HEY WHAT'S UP I THINK WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS
Email: [two arrows are pointing at the picture of T-Rex] Would you like to go on bike rides and get ice cream with this guy?? ps my name's T-REX and I AM REAL COOL

Narrator: LATE LAST NIGHT:
God: T-REX HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HOMOGRAPHIC HOMOPHONIC AUTANTONYMS
T-Rex: I have not!
God: OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
Narrator: THIS MORNING:
T-Rex: Sorry, other word classes! I have a NEW girlfriend now!
T-Rex: A homographic homophonic autantonym is a word that is spelt AND pronounced the same, but has two opposite and contradictory meanings! For example, I can dust a crop (adding pesticides to it), or I can dust a counter (removing dust from it)! Way to go, dust! You are a winner; you are a word that contains multitudes.
Dromiceiomimus: Why do we let language get like this?
T-Rex: Probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome?
Utahraptor: And both "dust"s are the same part of speech there, too, so you can't use word order to determine meaning!
T-Rex: INDEED!
T-Rex: ALL YOU CAN DO is hope to use your real-world knowledge about crops and tables to figure out what's going on. And it's even worse with words like "overlook", meaning "examine" but ALSO meaning "miss noticing entirely". Can't rely on the noun there!
Utahraptor: How come you love words that make communication difficult?
T-Rex: What is not to like? They're words that do their job in the most sarcastic, sullen, passive-aggressive way possible, and they totally get away with it!
T-Rex (punchline): I just want to pat them on the head and ruffle their hair, you know?




T-Rex: Homophones are words that SOUND the same but mean different things, like "news" and "gnus". Way to go only part way, HOMOPHONES.
T-Rex: Don't bother showing up to my dinner party, HOMOPHONES.
T-Rex: MORE impressive, and still invited for Yukon Potato Gnocchi, are words that are SPELT the same, but have two different meanings: words like "attribute" (to credit something to someone) and "attribute" (a property of something)! One's a noun and one's a verb and it's seriously so awesome. I cannot imagine how to perfect these words, as they are already perfect! Oh ho ho!
Utahraptor: But are there really a lot of these words?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Let's be serious.
T-Rex: Are you not familiar with accent? Or with addict, combine, conduct, conflict, content, and object? PERHAPS YOU'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY HELLO TO PERFECT, PRESENT, PROGRESS, REFUND, SUSPECT, AND UPSET?
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Okay. Well. They're at my dinner party tonight.
Narrator: LATER THAT EVENING.
T-Rex: Man! I've got to start inviting REAL people to my parties.
God (punchline): WAIT WHAT




T-Rex: If you like it when I'm wrong, then get ready to be SERIOUSLY SAD for the rest of your friggin' life!!
T-Rex: That's because I'VE come up with a way to never be wrong again!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, ask me how many cells an average adult dinosaur has making up their body.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, how many?
T-Rex: More than 100! Oh snap! Is that statement FACTUALLY ACCURATE??
T-Rex: It's extraordinarily likely that it's factually accurate, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: So you're right by being as conservative in your estimations as possible!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: But they're not semantically empty! I do convey some small information, but words like "at most" and "fewer than" allow me all sorts of leeway!
Utahraptor: It seems like this is just going to be annoying.
T-Rex: No no, people will love it! I PROMISE.
T-Rex: And as you know, Utahraptor, fewer than four out of ten people respect my promises -- and possibly more!
Off panel: ...
T-Rex (punchline): ...You heard me.




T-Rex: Okay, I should've been an interior decorator, because I've got the best ideas. I've got THE BEST FRIGGIN IDEAS.
T-Rex: And to prove it, here's one of my best friggin' ideas!!
T-Rex: What you do is you have a bunch of framed newspaper front pages of major world events: walking on the moon, archduke assassination, etc. All the greatest hits of the past 200 years.
Dromiceiomimus: Old papers look classy and cultured, so you'll look classy and cultured too!
T-Rex: Exactly! But when someone asks about them, you say they're "TEMPORAL CANARIES".
Utahraptor: You'll be the first to notice if someone changes the past, because the papers will change!
T-Rex: YES.
T-Rex: And here's the kicker: among all these framed pages of war and peace, you have one story that's just completely irrelevant, some small town non-story. And when someone asks about THAT, you look at it, your smile fades, you say "OH GOD, IT'S CHANGED, THERE'S NO TIME" and you run outside.
T-Rex: You abandon your past life and are never seen again. You become a LEGEND.
T-Rex: T-Rex's Interior Decoration: Because Good Design Can Set You Free™
T-Rex: Forever, Endlessly Free™
T-Rex (punchline): There's No Going Back And No God Can Judge You™




T-Rex: Hey, for whom does that bell toll?
God: OH MAN
God: DON'T EVEN ASK
Narrator: FAMOUS QUOTATIONS IN SINGLE PANELS
T-Rex: I'm not sure if my time machine sent me back too far! Quick: what time, age, epoch, and season is it?
Dromiceiomimus: Best and worst, wisdom and foolishness, belief and incredulity, light and hope, and darkness and despair!
T-Rex: Okay
T-Rex: Neato
T-Rex: This chick's writing fiction in her own room!
Utahraptor: WHOAH. She must have MONEY.
T-Rex: Aw man, did something gang aft agley in here? Something smells like it gang afty agleyed hardcore.
Utahraptor: Yeah, I... kinda left some of my schemes out. My best-laid ones, actually.
T-Rex: Dude. NAST-TEE.
T-Rex: According to my map of the yellow woods, this road diverges here.
Off panel: It doesn't matter which road we take: later we'll just TELL people we took the more indie one!
T-Rex (punchline): Nice! I'm glad we didn't misunderstand this quote as is commonly done




T-Rex: Sure it's great to meet someone and fall in love and spend the rest of your lives together. If you're BASIC.
T-Rex: REAL next level stuff is to have an AMAZING meet-cute story!
T-Rex: And the best meet-cute stories are the "we were at Disneyland or somewhere and he was in the background of my photo and we NEVER KNEW". So if you're next level like me, you make sure that happens!
Dromiceiomimus: How? By photobombing every single person on Earth?
T-Rex: PRECISELY.
Utahraptor: But how? Even stadium photos only get you 70-100k people, tops!
T-Rex: So be SMARTER about it!
T-Rex: Instead, travel far and wide, taking advantage of PERVASIVE SURVEILLANCE, including PERSONALLY CONSTANTLY AND SECRETLY RECORDING EVERYONE AROUND YOU! Then when you meet someone, run facial recognition on the decades of footage and BAM: instant cute stories about being in the same space before and not realizing.
Banner: Romance
T-Rex: We were in the same mall bathroom for 15.4 seconds twenty years ago! Here's a timestamped security image!
Off panel (punchline): Wow, I can't believe you found each other




Off panel: T-Rex, I am a real doctor. Here is your tetanus shot. You'll need to get it again in 10 years.
T-Rex: NOT A PROBLEM!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: WAIT, THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM!!
T-Rex: Let's be honest: it's 100% guaranteed that I'm not going to remember an appointment for a decade! And I'd lose any piece of paper I wrote down a reminder on.
Dromiceiomimus: How about a calendar website or program?
T-Rex: Dude, I don't still use a single piece of software I used 10 years ago! That trend seems likely to continue.
Dromiceiomimus: I guess... a Facebook event?
T-Rex: Oh God! Imagine if I'm using Facebook a decade from now?
Utahraptor: Aw geez. Aw GEEZ.
Utahraptor: Listen, let's make a Facebook event for a decade out that says "SELF, IF YOU ARE STILL ON FACEBOOK WHEN THIS EVENT HAPPENS, THEN WE HAVE MADE SOME BAD FRIGGIN' DECISIONS."
T-Rex: "ALSO: GET YOUR TETANUS SHOT AGAIN"
T-Rex: Two birds with one stone!
Narrator: TEN YEARS LATER:
T-Rex: Oh man! Remember when I set up this event?
Off panel: Oh man! Remember when it was legal not to be on Facebook?
T-Rex (punchline): Oh man! Remember when you wouldn't go to jail if you named your kid something other than "Facebook's V. Cool"??




T-Rex: Hallowe'en was yesterday, and we all had a lot of fun with ghosts and goblins and other spookums. But can we be even MORE spooked??
T-Rex: I boldly say: YES!
T-Rex: And I boldly go on to propose a NEW holiday, called "The Day After Hallowe'en", in which we get EVEN SPOOKIER. So you think you've made it through Hallowe'en without being terrified, and then - BAM! Surprise! Suddenly it's TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS LONG and there's a whole new host of spookums you never expected, assuming this is the first year we celebrate The Day After Hallowe'en and also it's unexpected somehow!!
Utahraptor: And the costumes are EVEN SPOOKIER??
T-Rex: Hell yeah! This is a night for TRUE HORROR.
Utahraptor: So your costume for this night is... what? "Structural Inequality"? "Precarious Employment"? "Militarized Police"? "Climate Change"? "Wealth Concentration"? "Crushing Debt"? "Unaffordable Housing And Retirement"? "Generational Wealth Inequality"? "Broken Social Safety Net"?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! I FEEL ONLY EXISTENTIAL DREAD!!
Off panel: Happy The Day After Hallowe'en!!
T-Rex: Wait! WAIT!
T-Rex (punchline): I also feel REGRET about my HOLIDAY SUGGESTIONS




T-Rex: What's that? The internet is down? FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-
T-Rex: -nnily enough, I carry a backup internet in my phone!
T-Rex: My phone internet is down? FFFFF-
T-Rex: -ortunately, there's a library nearby!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: What's that, the library is closed? Well, FRRRRIIIIII-
T-Rex: -day means that local restaurant that's only open on Fridays and has all the free WiFis is open!
Narrator: SOON:
Utahraptor: Today's not Friday! They're closed and they turned off their internet.
T-Rex: Hey, you made the same mistake too! Listen, is the internet working on your phone?
Utahraptor: Nope.
T-Rex: THEN I AM NOT TOO PROUD TO BEG. Please, excuse me for a moment.
T-Rex: Attention, everybody!! Can anyone send an email for me that reads "HEY MOM I ATE TOO MUCH LAST NIGHT LOL JK"?
T-Rex: That's "EL OH EL JAY KAY"
T-Rex (punchline): That is my EMAIL SIGNATURE and it's AMAZING and you are not allowed to STEAL IT




T-Rex: "Life is a neoclassical pastiche"!
T-Rex: This is gold!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you agree that life is a neoclassical pastiche?
Dromiceiomimus: I would not, as I think you couldn't even define what a neoclassical pastiche is, my friend.
T-Rex: Well Dromiceiomimus, I think it's pretty clear.
T-Rex: Ah, yes indeed! Life is a neoclassical pastiche, and I, a great philosopher!
Utahraptor: No you're not!
Utahraptor: And you should stop saying that, because saying life is a neoclassical pastiche is ridiculous, and nobody agrees with you.
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Let's put it to the public, shall we?
Utahraptor: Fine! Let's do it right now!
Off panel: Excuse me! Everybody? Would you say it's true that life is a neoclassical pastiche?
T-Rex (punchline): Somebody say yes!




T-Rex: The greatest proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not being visited by tourists from the future. I call this Sexy T-Rex's Argument Against Time Travel!
God: STEPHEN HAWKING SAID THAT ALREADY
T-Rex: ...fine! FINE.
T-Rex: Stephen Hawking is a smart guy; it makes sense he'd get there first. However, did he ever say maybe time tourists are ALREADY walking among us, but they've disguised themselves so well that we've never noticed?
Dromiceiomimus: No, but Carl Sagan did.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...He WOULD.
Utahraptor: Turns out greater minds than yours have thought about time travel already, huh?
T-Rex: Sure, but that's fine!
T-Rex: I'm PERFECTLY CONTENT if nobody ever talks about T-Rex's Argument Against Time Travel. It's the idea that's important, not who gets credit for it!
Utahraptor: Really? That's very mature of you.
T-Rex: Thank you! I am an extremely mature gentleman, and I'm flattered you noticed.
Narrator: LATER: T-REX VANDALIZES A BATHROOM WALL WITH THE WORDS "STEPHEN HAWKING AND CARL SAGAN, YOU BOTH HAVE UNWITTINGLY DONE ME A SMALL UNKINDNESS"
T-Rex (punchline): It's as forceful as I could get; I love those guys!!




God: T-REX WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
T-Rex: Pals!
T-Rex: Pals are the most important thing!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, what about my, um, significant other(s)?
T-Rex: They're just a special case of pals! They're "pals that you can kiss and tell secrets to".
Dromiceiomimus: What about food? I need that to live!
T-Rex: Food is just pals you eat!
Utahraptor: Making the world a better place is important to me AND I don't eat it!
T-Rex: Sure!
T-Rex: But WHY do you want to do that? Why do you do anything? I'll tell you why: you do it either for yourself or for others! And others are pals, protopals or potential pals, and you -- why, you're just a self reflexive autopal!!
Utahraptor: Good point!
T-Rex: Also inanimate objects can be pals.
God: UM T-REX YOUR DEFINITION OF "PALS" SEEMS TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING
T-Rex: No way! It excludes jerks and enemies, because who likes jerks and enemies? NOBODY!!
T-Rex: Hey God!
T-Rex (punchline): MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD TELL THEM THAT, HUH??




Narrator: T-REX IN: "COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS"
T-Rex: Computational linguistics is the study of computer-based language processing!
T-Rex: A major area of computational lingistics is that of "ambiguity resolution". It turns out that many things people say in a language - English, for example - can have more than one meaning!
T-Rex: Consider the phrase "fruit flies like a banana". Is it describing the taste of fruit flies, or rather flying fruit? How can a computer hope to figure this out?
T-Rex: Many have focused on statistical modelling of language, but this approach is approximate.
Utahraptor: I agree!
T-Rex: What do YOU know about computational linguistics?
Utahraptor: Ever read a little paper called "Non-Statistical Models for Unsupervised Prepositional Phrase Attachment?"
Utahraptor: That was me!
Utahraptor: [small] It was some of my earliest work on head word tuples!
T-Rex: Shit man, you know more about this than I do!
T-Rex (punchline): You know what? You should be the one doing the talking here!




T-Rex: It's time for some embarrassing stories!
Narrator: EMBARRASSING STORIES COMICS
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, do you have any EMBARRASSING STORIES you feel like sharing??
Dromiceiomimus: None that I feel comfortable telling right now!
T-Rex: Well! I suppose that's fair. I did kind of put you on the spot. Maybe - maybe next time!
T-Rex: And maybe UTAHRAPTOR will have some embarrassing stories!
Utahraptor: Nope! I've got nothing.
T-Rex: MAN! I don't want to be the only dude with an embarrassing past. You must have something!
Utahraptor: One time I got a little lost while driving in a new town.
T-Rex: That is so BARELY embarrassing.
God: T-REX ONE TIME UTAHRAPTOR DRANK TOO MUCH MILK AND WAS UP ALL NIGHT BEING SICK
T-Rex: I've actually done that too!
God: YOU GUYS
God (punchline): YOU OUGHT TO GET TVS OR SOMETHING




T-Rex: Want to be a smarter person? Sure, lots of us do. But how can we be sure we're getting smarter?
T-Rex: How can we measure something as crazy as intelligence?
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, if you're going to say something as flawed and culturally relative as "an IQ test" I will pick you up and break you over my knee.
T-Rex: I wasn't, but - you can do that?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, I can do that.
T-Rex: I... believe you, I think??
Utahraptor: So what were you going to suggest?
T-Rex: Relative measurement!
T-Rex: It's hard to give everyone a sortable intelligence score, but it's TRIVIAL to make sure you're smarter than you were yesterday: just learn something new! Memorize a new vocabulary word each day and you'll be both smarter AND more well spoken. You TRULY will have achieved a beautiful embrocation.
Off panel: I thought that word meant "to rub an oil or other moist medicine into a diseased part of the body".
T-Rex: [thinks] OMG WHY DOES HE KNOW THAT WORD
T-Rex: ...Yes. Uh, this was a test, and you passed.
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] SERIOUSLY THOUGH




T-Rex: I have one friend in particular that I haven't seen in, I'll say it, a LITTLE while...
T-Rex: ...my good friend Mr. Tusks!!
Dromiceiomimus: Mr. Tusks - you're talking about the vice-mayor of Tiny Towne Island?
T-Rex: The very same! He's an elephant that got island dwarfism and now he's MEGA SMALL! IT'S SO ADORABLE.
T-Rex: [small] Hence my size-based pun at the start
T-Rex: [small] It might be problematic but I'm hoping I'm fine
Narrator: THAT EVENING, ON TINY TOWNE ISLAND:
Utahraptor: Sorry I'm late!
T-Rex: No worries, man!
Girl: [tiny] Excuse me, sir
T-Rex: I'm just glad we're both here to catch up with my good friend Mr. Tusks. I'm a... TINY bit excited to be here!
Utahraptor: That IS the official town motto here!
T-Rex: Now... where's Mr. Tusks?
Off panel: [tiny] How rude
Off panel: [small] Hullo T-Rex, sorry I'm late! I ran into a... LITTLE bit of traffic??
T-Rex: Hah! CLASSIC Mr. Tusks!!
Off panel (punchline): [small] In all seriousness though it is one of the major issues of my vice-mayoralty




T-Rex: If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die? And if you deny our friend request shall we not be all passive-aggressive about that?
Narrator: FACEBOOK SHAKESPEARE
T-Rex: Like if you agree!!
T-Rex: All the world's a social network, and all the men and women merely potential friends.
Dromiceiomimus: So true, Facebook Shakespeare!
T-Rex: They have their signup dates and friend lists; and one man in his time joins many networks, though of course Facebook is the best.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm beginning to doubt your impartiality, Facebook Shakespeare!
T-Rex: To thine own profile be true, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: Can do, Facebook Shakespeare!
T-Rex: 'Tis better to have been friended and unfriended, than never to have been friended at all!
Utahraptor: Wait a second, WAIT A SECOND. That's not Shakespeare, that's Tennyson!! Facebook Shakespeare, are you actually a GIANT FRAUD??
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: Facebook Shakespeare is embarrassed and has deleted his profile!!
Off panel: Okay!
T-Rex: Facebook Shakespeare is back as "LOL!! Mega Geeky Facebook Status Updates Your Followers Will Be SURE To Share!"
Off panel (punchline): Oh god




T-Rex: You know those guys who are quiet and unassuming but when they die folks look in their house and find an AMAZING unpublished manuscript that nobody knew they were writing?
T-Rex: I would like to be one of those guys, please!
T-Rex: I would also like not to die, please!
T-Rex: All I REALLY want is someone to look through my stuff when I'm not around and find something that makes them say, "Wow, T-Rex had such a rich inner life and incredibly powerful imagination; I guess he really WAS one of the greatest minds of this or - I'll say it - any other generation."
Dromiceiomimus: What did you have in mind to leave behind to make people say this?
T-Rex: I dunno - neatly pressed shirts?
Utahraptor: Neatly pressed shirts. Really?
T-Rex: Incidentally, do you know how to press shirts?
Utahraptor: I do, yes, because I am an adult. Listen, if you ARE secretly working on a 15,145 page magnum opus or something, the whole point of this is you're never supposed to mention it! Otherwise we might suspect and the surprise is RUINED.
T-Rex: Suspect what? That I'm secretly a genius author? Allow me to be the first to say:
T-Rex (punchline): PROCEED




Narrator: GREGOR MACGREGOR COMICS
T-Rex: That name is totally made up. It was made up by a Scottish Enthusiast.
T-Rex: I'm just sayin'.
T-Rex: Anyway, Gregor MacGregor was this explorer adventurer guy in the 1800s!
T-Rex: In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England, with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30,000 km² of land! The land was incredibly fertile, the natives helpful, and he'd already established an army, banks, civil service AND democracy there. You couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground, and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate!!
Utahraptor: You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais, T-Rex! That was a huge scam!
T-Rex: It - what?
Utahraptor: When the colony boats arrived, instead of opera houses they found untamed jungle, tropical disease and venomous snakes. One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage. By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London, 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED.
God: SEE T-REX THIS IS WHY I KEEP SAYING YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR BOOKS BEFORE TELLING YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THEM
T-Rex: It wasn't a book!!
T-Rex (punchline): It was a WIKIPEDIA PAGE that got BORING half-way through




T-Rex: Okay, it's time for a TRUE horror story, for reals this time. Prepare yourself to be SO TERRIFIED that your mind breaks; prepare to be reduced to GIBBERING MADNESS!
T-Rex: Prepare to lose your job for gibbering madness all the time!
T-Rex: Prepare to rely on our social safety net and go on welfare. PREPARE FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE TO CHANGE as soon as you read my chilling words of blinding insanity and congealed terror, safely printed on non-toxic paper that you read while holding the book at a reasonable distance!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay! I've prepared for all those things, T-Rex.
Utahraptor: Yeah, let's hear your story! We're all hella prepared for terror and madness.
T-Rex: Okay, but I warned you!
T-Rex: Ahem. One day a murderer went crazy and sliced people in half until they DIED. He killed everyone in town and then he turned to the camera and said he'd kill YOU, the reader!!
T-Rex: THE END!!
Off panel: ...Are you looking for feedback?
T-Rex: ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MORE HORROR?
T-Rex and off panel (punchline): Not really I guess




T-Rex: Sure, it's great to be conscious and be able to envision ourselves and imagine possible futures and make decisions and all that.
T-Rex: Consciousness: pretty okay!
T-Rex: But I alone dare to ask: what's next?
T-Rex: What does SUPERconsciousness look like, you guys? Or, if I am looking to get beat up, what features do you see milestoned for Consciousness 2.0?
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, are you looking to get beat up?
T-Rex: With that sentence, yes.
T-Rex: There is no denying it
Utahraptor: Well I think memory could totally use some improvement!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: It's unreliable, but we rely on it both to make decisions and predict the future. A more accurate memory could give better-informed outcomes of both. Heck, a SHARED memory would be incredibly powerful! I'd like that.
T-Rex: But then you'd know my secrets!
Utahraptor: And you'd know mine!
T-Rex: Utahraptor that's all well and good but I've got some secrets that I can't really see myself sharing! For example, and I never thought I'd ever tell anyone this, but, well, this one time -
T-Rex (punchline): ... I'm PRETTY SURE I figured out a way to have sex when it's JUST YOU




T-Rex: Okay, so perhaps there ARE those who find old jokes in old books to be hilarious, and we just happen to have different senses of humour! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE TO GENERALIZE ACROSS EVERY LIVING THING THAT CAN LAUGH, AND ALSO READ.
T-Rex: This I do concede!
T-Rex: But, I still think that it's true that, given a random joke from the present and one from the past, the average person will be more likely to laugh at the present joke, just because they have more context. I'm convinced present-day jokes about airplane food will fade in cultural relevance and become less funny as airplanes are replaced by HoverPants!
Utahraptor: Hey, nice move, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Ah, you refer to my classy search for a middle ground!
Utahraptor: No, I meant the whole "shift the argument to the future" thing, so that nobody can disagree with you! It was smooth.
T-Rex: Hee, it's true! It's the same argument, but since the future doesn't exist yet, nobody can really argue with me about it one way or the other!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE:
T-Rex: The hell? What was I saying about us not existing?
Off panel: I dunno man!
T-Rex (punchline): I would have words with past T-Rex! That dude has a lot of STALE FRIGGIN' OPINIONS.




Narrator: COMPRESSED FILM COMICS today's film:
Narrator: WARGAMES
T-Rex: I am Matthew Broderick: computer hacker!
T-Rex: And I've accidentally wardialed my way into a secret military computer that I mistake for a game developer's machine. I believe I will play this mysterious game called "GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR"
Dromiceiomimus: Let's bomb Los Angeles!
T-Rex: Kay! Incidentally, I use an acoustic coupler as a modem, and that's so retro it's cool again.
Dromiceiomimus: No argument here
Utahraptor: I'm a US Military Agent!
T-Rex: Holy smokes!
Utahraptor: You're under arrest for hacking into our computer and also it's still playing your game and it controls our nukes and it's definitely going to start WW ]|[ by launching them against the Soviets. Cold War, remember?
T-Rex: No worries! I will teach it the MADness of its actions through zillions of tied games of Tic-Tac-Toe!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: [“computer” font] A strange game, Matthew Broderick. It seems the only winning move is not to play.
T-Rex: Oh my God. I love this movie.
Off panel: Man, me too! They should totally do a crossover with me and Skynet.
Off panel (punchline): ERROR 22: IDEA IS TOO AWESOME




T-Rex: Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down. And I’d like to take a minute - just sit right there -
T-Rex: I’ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air!
T-Rex: In West Philadelphia, born and raised: on the playground was where I spent most of my days! Chilling out, maxin', relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school, when a couple of guys (they were up to no good) started making trouble in my neighbourhood! I got in ONE LITTLE FIGHT and my mom got scared, and said
Dromiceiomimus: You're moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel-Air!
T-Rex: I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror!
Utahraptor: T-Rex?
T-Rex: [tiny] ssh!
T-Rex: If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it: yo home, to Bel-Air!"
Utahraptor: You
Utahraptor: pulled
Utahraptor: up to a house about seven or eight and you yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes, smell you later!"?
T-Rex: Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): Awesome! Okay, what was it you wanted to talk about?




T-Rex: A Story about a Man, by T-Rex!
T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a radical guy!
T-Rex: He filed his taxes on time, but ONE DAY, the government mailed him and was like, "Dude you need to file taxes for the past five years" and the dude was like "DUDES I ALREADY TOTALLY DID" and the government guy was like "Hah hah, our mistake!" but then their computers kept mailing him threatening "pay your taxes" letters and he felt like the problem would never be fixed and it caused him a lot of stress THE END.
Utahraptor: Autobiographical?
T-Rex: Absolutely not!
T-Rex: FICTION. As a man who is attuned with the world around him, I make up stories that SEEM real, but are actually just lies that I imagined! It's called "writing"; look it up?
Utahraptor: You're sure it's not autobiographical? No problems with the tax man?
T-Rex: No sir!
God: ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN YOU HAVE NO TROUBLES WITH THE TAX MAN
T-Rex: Yep! You know what? I'm not even fully sure what taxes ARE.
God: OKAY YOU ARE A GROWN ADULT SO
God (punchline): THAT'S A CONCERN




T-Rex: Oh my gosh! I'm ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that I've just had the best idea for a superhero ever.
T-Rex: The PaciFIST!
T-Rex: She's torn between her desire for Gandhian passive resistance and her desire to punch her way to a unilaterally imposed solution!! She's a conflicted hero for a conflicted age, you guys!
Dromiceiomimus: And the "fist" is capitalized?
T-Rex: Of course! Also, "paci" is in wimpy script letters and "fist" is in these big exploding block letters!
T-Rex: That, my friends, is called "graphic design".
Utahraptor: So what's her origin story?
T-Rex: Oh, the standard: she was a super pacifist but then realized she super liked punching dudes, and so swore on her parents' grave that from now on she would DEFINITELY try to do both.
Utahraptor: I honestly don't see an audience for this.
T-Rex: Utahraptor! Hello? IT'S A METAPHOR FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS??
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So, um -
T-Rex (punchline): Most of my relationships have been "complicated".




T-Rex: Bachelors! Are you tired of having to clean up after yourself? Here's some great
T-Rex: HOUSEKEEPING TIPS FOR BACHELORS
T-Rex: sorry for shouting
T-Rex: #1 recommendation: be born in a time where all housecleaning is automated. You will save SO MUCH TIME.
Dromiceiomimus: However, if you have already failed at our first recommendation, we recommend instead being born at a time in the past when hunting and gathering was the dominant - actually, the ONLY - lifestyle!
Utahraptor: Wouldn't people still have homes then? Homes which need KEEPING??
T-Rex: Oh, sure!
T-Rex: But since they have to follow sources of food, all housing is necessarily temporary. And a temporary home is a home you can trash whenever you want and then just leave it behind! It truly was a golden age for sloppy bachelors, as far as housekeeping was concerned!!
Banner: BEING A BACHELOR IS EASY
T-Rex: As hunting and gathering was dominant for over 90% of our history, odds are we've ALREADY solved your housekeeping problem!
Banner (punchline): You're welcome




T-Rex: Who owes me money? Utahraptor owes me money!
T-Rex: Homeboy owes me 30 bucks!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, does Utahraptor owe YOU any money? Because he owes me 30 bucks and I was thinking, if he owes you money too, maybe we could team up and get him to pay.
Dromiceiomimus: No T-Rex, nobody owes me money! I keep money and friendship separate.
T-Rex: Utahraptor keeps money and FRIENDS separate! My money and ME (the friend), that is!!
Utahraptor: I don't owe you any money, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You owe me 30 clams! 30 BUCKAZOIDS.
Utahraptor: Man, YOU owe ME 12 dollars! We were at the grocery store and you REALLY wanted to get those stupid fish sticks shaped like Jane Austen, remember?
T-Rex: Hah hah, yeah, I remember those! They were insane!!
T-Rex: They tasted like chalk, but looked like Jane Austen! Fishstick Austen!!
Off panel: "Jane Austen's Fishytime Bites", yeah, I was there.
T-Rex (punchline): It turns out that's all I ever wanted in a mealtime treat!




T-Rex: I have received a stern letter from the "government"! They are angry because I didn't pay my "taxes" last year! Well, guess what, government?
T-Rex: Last year is now officially non-canon!
Narrator: T-REX IN: SOLVING PROBLEMS BY DECLARING PARTS OF YOUR LIFE TO BE NON-CANON
T-Rex: I got the idea from TV! From now on, whenever something I don't like happens to me, I'll just declare it to be non-canon!
Dromiceiomimus: Is this conversation canon?
T-Rex: So far!
Utahraptor: You can't apply ideas from FICTION to your own life!
T-Rex: Sure I can! I just did!
T-Rex: Remember that time I got beat up in Grade 2? Guess what? It's not canon anymore! And remember that time I lost a baby? Guess what?
Utahraptor: It's not canon anymore?
T-Rex: CORRECT!
T-Rex: In summary, any event in which I was embarrassed is now non-canon!
T-Rex: I've also retroconned my name to be "Mister Awesome", by the way!
T-Rex (punchline): JEALOUS?




T-Rex: We've spent generations trying to figure out how to fly. And now we know how to do it! Kinda!
T-Rex: We can fly if we've got an airplane wrapped around us, anyway!
T-Rex: Meanwhile, FAIRIES have been able to fly since forever and they do so under their own power. Have they shared any heavier-than-air flight skills with us? NO THEY HAVE NOT.
Dromiceiomimus: But - aren't fairies magic?
T-Rex: That's even worse! We've got nuclear waste that has to be managed for the next thousand years. SOME MAGIC SURE WOULD BE HANDY FOR THAT, HUH?? WOW. WOW IT SURE WOULD.
Utahraptor: Maybe it's like a fairy Prime Directive thing!
T-Rex: That - makes sense, actually!
T-Rex: Giving us magic overnight would destroy us! IN FACT, maybe that's why fairies themselves are so rare: when they invented magic, they nearly destroyed themselves with the sudden, unpredictable and corrupting power!
Utahraptor: The few survivors dare only use a handful of protective spells: immortality and flight!
T-Rex: Yes! And the magical fallout means they can't ever go home again!! I always thought I'd never say this, but... "I really want to read a novel set during the Fairy Magic Civil War".
T-Rex (punchline): Wow. Life surprises you sometimes, am I right?




T-Rex: Oh man, I haven't bought anyone any presents yet! I AM SO POOCHED! I am the worst friend in the world.
T-Rex: This will consummate my social ruin FOR SURE!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Oh, hey, Dromiceiomimus! How's - how are things?
Dromiceiomimus: Things are alright, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Haha, that's cool! Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow: Christmas Eve! I have a very special present for YOU, my friend.
Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah, sure thing! Thanks!
T-Rex: Why did I say that?? I AM EVEN MORE POOCHED THAN EVER BEFORE.
Utahraptor: No presents, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Nope! And then I compounded it by telling Dromiceiomimus that I had something extra special for her. And OH MAN, now you know my secret. I'm out of control!
Utahraptor: It's okay! We'll be your friends even without presents.
T-Rex: I know I know but still!
Narrator: LATER: A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE??
T-Rex: Hey!!
T-Rex (punchline): I could give Dromiceiomimus my toaster!




T-Rex: What's that, Dromiceiomimus?
T-Rex: You're asking, "How much of someone's personality is determined by their body?"
T-Rex: Well, Dromiceiomimus, that IS an interesting question! A few years ago I would have said "none", but now I'm not so sure! In a way, our bodies do affect who we are: if you've got a strong body, you can be a different person than someone in a weaker body. Trivially, a weak-bodied person wouldn't make a good bully!
Dromiceiomimus: I asked none of these questions
T-Rex: And Utahraptor, you're suggesting that not all strong people are bullies?
Utahraptor: I - okay?
T-Rex: Well, Utahraptor, I'll agree with you, and clarify that it's a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Bodies affect the life experiences possible, and therefore personality! And while you're questioning my premise of "nature over nurture" I'll clarify that I'm simply saying that someone in a weak body can't be a very effective bully!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (punchline): Man, NOBODY calls me anymore




T-Rex: Plato was a philosopher guy who said perfect dudes don't exist. Rather, all dudes are imperfect instantiations of the perfect IDEAL of dudes, the essential dude, intangible essence of dudeness!
T-Rex: Plato also said things like "I'm hungry, guys, frig!" but we're not remembering him for that right now!
T-Rex: Ours is an imperfect world, and as such, there's no perfect dudes in it. All the dudes we have are imperfect instances - copies, if you will - of the ideal dude, who is so great he can't even EXIST.
Dromiceiomimus: But what about if you and I have different ideas about what the perfect dude is?
Dromiceiomimus: It's just I'm - I'm pretty sure we do.
Utahraptor: Plato really said this about... dudes?
T-Rex: Okay, NO, not technically.
T-Rex: He was actually talking about everything, but that includes dudes! I used dudes because it's an example EVERYONE can get behind.
Utahraptor: Wouldn't circles be a better example? We can all imagine a perfect circle, but we can't draw one.
T-Rex: Um, computers can??
Off panel: Those are pixelated if you look closely, T-Rex! And before you say "robots can", they still draw them on some medium, and that's made of atoms.
T-Rex: And atoms are NATURE'S pixels! You just proved my case for me! Awesome!
T-Rex (punchline): Okay now, bring it back to dudes!!




T-Rex: Guns! Folks buy guns when they want the ability to be able to point at something and make that something have a hole in it.
T-Rex: But they have other uses too!
T-Rex: For instance, should a can be out of arm's reach and you're like, man, I wish that can had a hole in it AND was knocked over, then a gun can be used here too!
T-Rex: Yes, adding new holes to things and bumping them around are but two of the many uses of guns!
Utahraptor: ...So? Go on!
T-Rex: What? I'm done!
T-Rex: I've said all I want to about guns.
Utahraptor: Ah. I thought maybe you'd wade into the gun control debate with something a little more substantial than "Need something punctured? Have you tried... A GUN?"
T-Rex: Hah! Looks like you thought wrong!
Narrator: EARLIER:
Off panel: Five bucks if you can get Utahraptor to say the word "punctured".
T-Rex: Attention, mysterious voice from behind me!
T-Rex (punchline): YOU'RE ON, BABY




T-Rex: The velocity of a body remains constant unless the body is acted upon by an external force.
T-Rex: That's Newton's First Law o' Motion!
T-Rex: But what did Newton know, huh?? Are we really gonna follow LAWS laid down by THE MAN?
Dromiceiomimus: Laws laid down by A man, you mean. Not THE man.
T-Rex: Still! What's the point of laws anyway? The good people don't need them and the bad people don't obey them!
Utahraptor: They're laws in the observational sense, not in the prescriptive sense.
T-Rex: OH.
T-Rex: Well clearly Newton has this thing wrapped up nicely and we're all going to remain at constant velocity until an external force acts on us because WE ALL LOVE FOLLOWING RULES.
Utahraptor: If you don't like the rules, make your own universe with different ones!
T-Rex: I WILL.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: HAH HAH HAH WOW
T-Rex: I HAVE LIKE
T-Rex (punchline): ZERO IDEA WHERE TO START




T-Rex: Birds, or "Bionic I.R.D."s, are the result of our grandparents and their cursèd meddling in the natural law!
Narrator: LET'S TALK ABOUT BIRDS
Narrator: without using facts
T-Rex: They first appeared in late 1700s, though of course those early examples were very crude compared to the later instances that, famously, appeared one day all on their own and have never left us alone since. Why, these days you can barely tell that a given B.I.R.D. is an unholy merging of our feeble science and the blackest magicks without dissecting one, and even then it's tricky!
Utahraptor: QUESTION: are birds safe to eat?
T-Rex: In the short term? Yep!
T-Rex: In the long term, once inside your body they move to your lungs and lay eggs. When you cough delicious eggs come up, which you can then swallow as a convenient source of free raw eggs, continuing the cycle. Swallows are a class of bird named for this very behaviour!
Utahraptor: Fascinating!
T-Rex: In conclusion, I got that "colonize your lungs so you cough up and then swallow their babies which lets them grow inside your stomach" from real-life parasitic worms; the world is horrifying.
Off panel (punchline): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH




Narrator: COMICS THAT END IN "OH SHIIII-"
T-Rex: Wow! The plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky.
T-Rex: What a beautiful day!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, what if beauty is nothing but an illusion? What if we're all nothing but dreams within dreams that, for an instant, imagine themselves to be real?
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: OH SHIIIIIIII-
Narrator: THE END
Utahraptor: Man, I was paying my taxes AND paying my heating bill today, and I think I put the wrong cheque in the wrong envelope!
T-Rex: No worries, Utahraptor! With two cheques, if you put the right cheque in the wrong envelope, you'd have a problem. But the wrong cheque in the wrong envelope is logically equivalent to the right cheque in the right envelope!
Utahraptor: T-Rex! That's not what I meant!
T-Rex and off panel (punchline): OH SHIIIIIIIIII-




T-Rex: Time to do it up...
T-Rex: Québec style!
T-Rex: Time to wrap up some presents for all my friends...
T-Rex: Québec style!
T-Rex: Time to STOMP ON THIS HOUSE - Québec style!
Utahraptor: Alright, I'll bite: what's "Québec style"?
T-Rex: It's new and exciting!
T-Rex: I invented it because it sounds, as I say, exciting and full of promise! "Let's go see a movie, Québec style!" Oh, wow! What does it mean? What's so different? I don't know, but I'm excited to find out!
Utahraptor: I'm not!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hey guys, I brought a nice salad - Québec style!
Off panel (punchline): Oooh!




T-Rex: He's my brother from another mother!
T-Rex: She's my sister from another mister!
T-Rex: She's my wife from another life!
Dromiceiomimus: She's my fiancée from some other day!
T-Rex: "SORRY BABY, YOU KNEW THE RISKS INVOLVED IN FALLING FOR A GUY WHO AVERAGES ONE FIANCÉE A DAY"
Utahraptor: He's my twin from another skin!
Utahraptor: No wait, from another kin!
T-Rex: She's my niece from another Maurice! That one works if you know two Maurices, with nieces.
Utahraptor: I don't know any. I mean, I know a guy some people call Maurice, but I'm not one of them.
T-Rex: What do you call him?
Utahraptor: I call him "Spencer" because that's his name.
Narrator (punchline): THE END




T-Rex: How long does it take to become a master violinist? A few weeks, maybe? Probably it's a few weeks.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: It takes DECADES?
T-Rex: Like, LITERAL decades?!
T-Rex: Turns out master violinists practice every day because their skills fade as soon as they take a break! And it takes such a long time to get to this elite level that it's a life choice they make way early on. These JERKS have known what they want to do with their lives since they were, like, SIX. That's ridiculous!
T-Rex: It's ridiculous, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: What are the odds a six-year-old would know what a thirty-year-old wants to do?
T-Rex: Exactly!!
T-Rex: I have so little in common with six year old me: we move in disparate social groups, we don't like the same foods, and our bodies are so unlike that if you didn't know about aging you'd think we're different people. The only thing we DO share is a deep and sustaining interest in what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are up to!
T-Rex: Oh, if only "grandmaster TMNT guy" had the same cultural cachet as "grandmaster violinist"!! Also, if only people paid to come hear me practice my art (i.e., talk about which turtle is my favourite) (It's Raphael)
T-Rex (punchline): (No wait!! DONATELLO)




T-Rex: Folks are always all, "What's the best form of government? DEMOCRACY. I love democracy, a bloo bloo bloo".
T-Rex: Walk it off, democracy lovers!
T-Rex: Contact me at suckitup@walkitoff.net, democracy lovers!
T-Rex: Democracy is OLD HAT. You know what democracy is? Democracy is long-term stuff never getting done, because short-term gains are what get folks re-elected. It had a good run, but now it's time for a more awesome -cracy, one that I just found out about because the Wikipedia random article button brought me to something that wasn't some stats on a crappy river for once.
Utahraptor: Ochlocracy? Isocracy? Stratocracy?
T-Rex: PORNOCRACY.
T-Rex: Rule by prostitutes! And I didn't make it up. The word's been used in historical times to refer to when popes were influenced by women!
Utahraptor: That's super sexist! Powerful women aren't necessarily SEX WORKERS.
T-Rex: Um, that's history??
Banner: HISTORY: SUPER SEXIST
T-Rex: Hello?! This is not a suprising moral! History is also like twenty kinds of racist!
T-Rex (punchline): I KINDA THOUGHT THAT WAS THE REASON WE ALL DECIDED NOT TO LIVE THERE??




Narrator: SO YOU WANT TO LEARN ENGLISH
T-Rex: You, my friend, have come to the right comic!
T-Rex: Alright!
T-Rex: To start, let's assume you know every word used in this comic!
T-Rex: If you don't, come back when you've learned them all. Don't worry, we'll ONLY be using the words found in this comic, so it shouldn't take too long. Ready? Perfect.
Dromiceiomimus: So the first thing you need to know is that everything is crazy in English and nothing makes sense.
T-Rex: Great! You're already a pro!
Utahraptor: HOWEVER: there are some rules that CANNOT be bent.
T-Rex: Memorize the following. LIVE IT.
T-Rex: The Oxford comma is important, critical, and necessary.
Utahraptor: If you say "begs the question" to mean "raises the question" you are a lesser person. Objectively so.
T-Rex and Utahraptor: These are our hills; we shall die on them.
Narrator: CONGRATULATIONS!! NOW YOU KNOW ENGLISH
Narrator: YES, IT IS TOO LATE FOR REGRETS
Narrator (punchline): YES, IT IS TOO LATE FOR US ALL




T-Rex: I wonder what it's like, being an attractive woman. Would I be tired of guys coming up and talking to me just because I'm pretty? Or would I rather find it flattering?
Narrator: WHAT IF T-REX WERE A CHICK COMICS
Dromiceiomimus: You'd also have to deal with sexual prejudice, T-Rex! All your bragging about your sexual prowess and "memorable lovemaking techniques" would probably make people think you're kind of slutty!
T-Rex: No!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes! Some people, anyway.
T-Rex: But - I'm not slutty!
Utahraptor: Well, you talk like you are, sometimes!
Utahraptor: You're always all, "Feelings are boring. Kissing is awesome!" You should make yourself a shirt that says that and wear it all the time.
T-Rex: I would honestly wear a shirt that says that.
Utahraptor: I know! That's totally why I'm suggesting it.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYONE IS AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN:
T-Rex (punchline): Spring break!!




T-Rex: There are a lot of problems in the world! Someone ought to do something.
T-Rex: Wait a second!
T-Rex: I'M someone!!
T-Rex: Okay Dromiceiomimus, I'M going to do something about all the problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Great attitude, T-Rex! And I'm sure people already working on problems will appreciate the help. Which problem(s) are you going to focus on?
T-Rex: Uh... all of them?
Utahraptor: Might help to focus on one or two of them.
T-Rex: Of COURSE! Utahraptor - that's IT!
T-Rex: There's BILLIONS of people alive right now, and surely - SURELY - there's not actually BILLIONS of problems. If everyone take one problem each and solve it, then it won't be a lick of work! And then we could have this licked lickety-split!
Off panel: Great, I'll take solving the problem of world hunger!
T-Rex: And I'll take our sudden overuse of lick-based idioms! It doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'm sure I can lick it into shape!
T-Rex (punchline): OH NO, IT'S GETTING WORSE




T-Rex: Let's not treat birthdays as the start of a new year for ourselves. That's BORING. Instead, let's treat them as our nth attempt to beat the roguelike game we call...
T-Rex: ..."Life"??
T-Rex: Every birthday is a celebration of DAY ZERO, where everything gets reset, and we see how much better we can do with THESE 365 days than we did the last time around.
Dromiceiomimus: So, what, we restart and have to make friends with everyone all over again?
T-Rex: No, for as in most modern Roguelikes, there are unlockables that persist between play sessions.
Utahraptor: So we keep the friends we already have, and that gives us an advantage in this run.
T-Rex: EXACTLY. And they do!
T-Rex: But can we unlock MORE friends this year? Better equipment? Heck. I don't know, but I WANNA FIND OUT.
Utahraptor: Huh. It kinda works! Life DOES have permadeath.
T-Rex: And it's a good thing too, because otherwise chumps would be camping on the spawn points!!
T-Rex: ...Wait a second, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MIDWIVES DO!! AND THEY STEAL ALL OUR LOOT TOO!
Off panel: Loot?
T-Rex: YOU KNOW
T-Rex (punchline): "AFTERBIRTH"




T-Rex: When I grow up I want to be... AN ASTRONAUT!
T-Rex: That's right, ladies! I'ma float in SPACE!!
God: BECOMING AN ASTRONAUT TAKES YEARS OF TRAINING AND NOT ONCE HAS ANYONE EVER DECIDED TO BECOME ONE AT YOUR AGE AND SUCCEEDED
T-Rex: ...Oh.
T-Rex: Oh.
T-Rex: Guess I missed the boat on that one, huh??
T-Rex: Guess I should just GIVE UP ON EVERYTHING, HUH??
Utahraptor: Not so fast, dude!
Utahraptor: The commercial spaceflight industry is growing quickly, and there's a chance - small, but non-zero - that spaceflight will become affordable before you die.
T-Rex: Sweet!
Utahraptor: But that's ONLY if you die years from now AND spend all your time until then investing your money carefully.
Narrator: THIS COMIC BROUGHT TO YOU BY RICH PEOPLE WHO WILL SOON BE ABLE TO GO INTO SPACE WHENEVER THEY WANT
Narrator (punchline): MUST BE NICE




Narrator: THINGS T-REX DID THAT ONE TIME
Narrator: ANSWERED THE PHONE IN THE NUDE:
T-Rex: Hah hah! Yep!
Narrator: PUSHED SOMEONE DOWN A SLIDE BEFORE THEY WERE READY:
Dromiceiomimus: Really, you did that? That's very unkind! Were they alright?
T-Rex: They were FINE. It's a slide! People are meant to fall down it!
Narrator: TRIED TO HAVE A NAP IN THE SHOWER:
Utahraptor: What made you think that was a good idea?
T-Rex: I was tired?
Narrator: LEFT A THERMOS FULL OF FOOD FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS, HOPING SOMEONE ELSE WOULD CLEAN IT OUT:
Utahraptor: Man, I remember that thermos! What happened when you opened it?
T-Rex: I don't know! It's in the attic. You can clean it out if you want!
Narrator: DONATED MONEY TO AN ORGANIZATION TO HELP BUILD NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE OVERSEAS:
T-Rex: Aww! A touching ending!
T-Rex (punchline): Also, this one time? I ate a whole lasagna before dinner but my parents got me in heaps of trouble.




T-Rex: Here are some of the worst things I've ever done by accident! ACCIDENT ONE: slapped someone right in the face!
T-Rex: Kapow!
Dromiceiomimus: How was that an accident?
T-Rex: I didn't see them there, that's all!
Dromiceiomimus: And - what? You were just slapping the space around you to pass the time?
T-Rex: WHO CAN SAY? All we really know for sure is that it was DEFINITELY an accident.
Utahraptor: Man, that was ME you slapped in the face, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hah! Accidentally!
Utahraptor: It was only an "accident" after the fact. Before the fact, you were like, "Hey, Utahraptor, I'm going to slap you in the face. I have been planning this slap for weeks and only now does my plan reach fruition!"
T-Rex: Man, such slander! Your parents should've named YOU "Sweeps Week".
T-Rex: By that, I mean to say that you are doing something controversial and exciting in order to get higher ratings! I'm likening you to a TV show.
T-Rex (punchline): We cool?




T-Rex: Hey, remember when I argued QUITE PERSUASIVELY that Aladdin was history's greatest monster for never ever wishing for an end to suffering?
T-Rex: Turns out he's got competition!
T-Rex: FROM SNOW WHITE'S WICKED QUEEN.
T-Rex: The story glosses over it kinda quickly, like they KNOW it's nuts, but this lady - this QUEEN - has a magic mirror which, due to its magical ways, will HONESTLY ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU PUT TO IT AS LONG AS IT RHYMES. And what does she use it for?
Dromiceiomimus: Prettiness tests!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: She doesn't say "Mirror mirror on the wall, how can life's curse of aging be stalled?"
Utahraptor: Nope!
Utahraptor: Nor does she say "Mirror mirror on the wall, how can clean energy be provided for all?" or even "Mirror mirror mounted here, how can chicks and dudes have satisfying careers?"
T-Rex: NOR does she ask "Mirror mirror mounted centrally, please provide a closed-system technique of reversing entropy". What a jerk!!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN FAIRYTALE LAND:
T-Rex: Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?
Off panel: Fair like pretty or fair like equality? The word has overloaded semantic duality.
T-Rex (punchline): True enough!




Narrator: FACTS ABOUT GIRAFFES
Narrator: PRINT OUT THIS COMIC AND PUT IT IN YOUR WALLET!
Narrator: THAT WAY, YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO FACTS ABOUT GIRAFFES
T-Rex: Did you know that ancient Greeks thought giraffes were a mixture of camel and leopard? Scientists still call giraffes "Giraffa camelopardalis" because everyone's afraid that if we change it, the ancient Greeks will be SO CHEEZED OFF that they'll all come back to life! ANGRY SKELETON LIFE!!
Dromiceiomimus: I didn't know the factual part of that, no
T-Rex: Giraffes have the lowest sleep needs of any land mammal!
Utahraptor: Only about 1.9 hours a day!
T-Rex: NICE.
Utahraptor: Female giraffes use their hooves to protect their young!
T-Rex: Man, they can kick LIONS to death! One kick can shatter a lion's SKULL. That's ultimate badass!
Utahraptor: Pretty sure that's ultimate badass!
Narrator: I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THESE GIRAFFE FACTS! NOW WHEN SOMEONE STEALS YOUR WALLET THEY'LL LEARN SOME FACTS ABOUT GIRAFFES.
Narrator: AT LEAST SOME GOOD CAN COME OUT OF THESE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES
Narrator (punchline): UM, FOR THE DUDE WHO STOLE YOUR WALLET I MEAN




T-Rex: The generation that fought WWII got called "The Greatest Generation"! Pretty slick move, Greatest Generation! They saw no other group had yet decided to name themselves "The #1 Best Collection Of People Since Time Began"...
T-Rex: ...and they WENT FOR IT.
T-Rex: But, thus emboldened, they NEVER STOPPED NAMING GENERATIONS. They all had babies - ARGUABLY TOO MANY - and called them "Baby Boomers". Perfect, right? Of COURSE a generation that would turn into today's seniors would nickname their babies "boomers". That's just what you'd expect a proto-grandparent to do!
Utahraptor: Did the Greatest Generation stop there?
T-Rex: THEY'LL NEVER STOP!
T-Rex: Next they labelled "Generation X" and called 'em SLACKERS. We were at peak "kids these days", OR SO WE THOUGHT, until they came up with "millennials": EVEN WORSE kids these days! Do you know that millennials use COMPUTERS more often than seniors do, and seniors use computers precisely the correct amount??
T-Rex (punchline): I was unaware of this but then I got stuck on a bus with a senior and now I'm woke af




T-Rex: OH MY GOD WHAT IF I'M THE GUY WITH THE WORLD'S MOST ANNOYING VOICE?? And worse...
T-Rex: ...what if it's not a 1:1 correspondence?!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, with "opposite soulmates", I was assuming that for every person there's someone who is just so, SO irritating to that person. But what if it's not 1:1? What if I'm the opposite soulmate for a huge swath of people?
T-Rex: AND THEN WHAT IF LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME FOR REASONS I CAN'T CONTROL??
Utahraptor: Congratulations, T-Rex: you have independently invented "popularity"!
T-Rex: No, this is different!
Utahraptor: Not really: you can't force folks to like you. And if they hate you for your voice, well, at least it's for something you are rather than something you're not, right?
T-Rex: I can CHANGE my voice. If someone hated it I'd change it for them!!
Utahraptor: And they say nothing's sexier than confidence.
T-Rex: And *I* say the opposite, which is that if everyone would just give me an itemized list of things they don't like about me, I'd be MORE than willing to adjust myself for them!!
T-Rex (punchline): Alas, we'll never know which of the two of us is right




T-Rex: English is pretty great!
T-Rex: And other languages too, but I don't really know about them, so whatever!!
T-Rex: For example, lets say you see a rockin' butt. You can say "That is a rockin' butt", but add "ultra" in front of there, and you know what you've got?
Dromiceiomimus: An ultrabutt?
T-Rex: A GOSH DARNED ROCKIN' ULTRABUTT.
Utahraptor: And while "ultrabutt" isn't a word in the dictionary, all speakers instantly know what it is!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: It's one of the better forms of butt! Similarly, all I need to do is speak the words "quadrobutt", "polybutt", "antibutt", "macrobutt", "exobutt", "hyperbutt", "multibutt", AND "omnibutt" and your mind is instantly filled with visions of strange and wonderful butts you've never even CONSIDERED before!!
T-Rex: English: it's great for butts!™
Off panel: That's not the official slogan of English. Also, nobody has ever trademarked that.
T-Rex: SAY IT
T-Rex (punchline): SAY ENGLISH IS GREAT FOR BUTTS




T-Rex: If I could give up any sense, what would it be? It's not going to be hearing or talking, because I do those ALL THE TIME.
God: ALSO "TALKING" ISN'T A SENSE
T-Rex: Whatevs!
T-Rex: And I don't want to give up touch, because then I'd be bumping my body into spikes and BARELY EVEN NOTICING. Taste wouldn't be too bad, but I'd miss tasting tasty things! I think it would have to be smell, assuming that that wouldn't impact taste.
Dromiceiomimus: I'd give up taste, because smell is good to warn you of fires!
T-Rex: Yeah but so's sight, and I can ALSO use sight to check out women, and dictionaries.
Utahraptor: I'm surprised at you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really? Why's that?
Utahraptor: You're basically sticking to the canonical five senses! I would have bet the first sense you'd give up is your sense of EMPATHY, or your sense of what's appropriate to say in social situations.
T-Rex: Hah! MAN. I would love to give up that sense! Can you imagine?
T-Rex: It would probably go down like this. Ask me if I want to go get a pizza!
Off panel: Okay. Do you want to go get a pizza, T-Rex?
T-Rex: SURE! Also, I -
T-Rex (punchline): - I have controversial theories about emigration?




Narrator: BATMAN'S LAST CASE
T-Rex: Batman, having solved all other crimes, found there was just one crime left. Unfortunately for him... it was the PERFECT crime. You see, SOMEONE had stolen a candy bar 15 years ago...
T-Rex: ...AND THEY'D GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT.
T-Rex: The shopkeeper who was robbed had never noticed it was missing, plus it was over a decade ago, so she definitely didn't want to press charges, which in Gotham City was code for "have Batman investigate (and/or throw batarangs at) the crime". Luckily for Batman, he didn't rely on shopkeepers to tell him when to investigate crimes!! He investigated ALL crimes, BECAUSE HE'S BATMAN, AND I LOVE HIM FOREVER.
Utahraptor: Also, this was the last crime left.
T-Rex: That too!
T-Rex: Anyway, Bats soon found the culprit: a young woman who had stolen the candy bar when she was a kid living on the streets. She'd since cleaned up her life and found success in retail management. She offered to repay the cost, but Batman did it himself, WITH interest. And with that, AT LONG LAST, crime was solved forever.
T-Rex: Batman retired to space, where he could fight crime on other planets.
Off panel: I don't see how this is a better story than "The Dark Knight Returns".
T-Rex (punchline): AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DON'T SEE THAT




Off panel: Hello, is Utahraptor there?
T-Rex: Nope! He's still asleep.
Off panel: He slumbers still?!
Off panel: When he arises, inform him his friend Doug would have words with him.
T-Rex: Sure thing?
Narrator: BACKSTORY: UTAHRAPTOR WAS CRASHING ON THE COUCH LAST NIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS LATE AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CAB HOME. ALSO, DOUG KNEW ABOUT THIS. DOUG IS A FRIEND OF UTAHRAPTOR'S. HE CALLED ON SPEAKERPHONE. T-REX IS SPENDING THIS PANEL SASSING THE WAY DOUG TALKS BUT LOOK AT ME. I NARRATED ALL OVER IT.
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: I don't see why you're making fun of Doug!
T-Rex: He talks like a 1920s villain!
Utahraptor: So, whatever! He talks like he's a 1920s serial villain. We all have idiolects. For example, you're a man who says "dude" and "awesome" in places where he could instead simply say "chap" and "I say, that's quite agreeable."
T-Rex: Yeah, but chap, you know what I don't say?
T-Rex: I don't say, "He slumbers still? Alack! One thousand curses! When the Sandman's spell at last lies vanquished at his feet, give him good heed: Doug has come calling."
Off panel: Maybe you should though.
T-Rex (punchline): I know, right?




T-Rex: Man, what a jerky guy! I met the jerkiest guy working at the computer store.
Narrator: T-REX AND THE REALLY JERKY GUY
Narrator: A STORY OF "THE HUMAN CONDITION"
Dromiceiomimus: What made him so jerky, T-Rex? His haircut?
T-Rex: Worse than that. He was just so smug about everything! I wanted to buy some RAM, so that my computer could think harder about things? But he had this air of - disdain, I guess, that went far beyond "aloof store clerk" to "terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive." I bought the RAM but now I can barely even enjoy it.
Utahraptor: Well, you're done with him now!
T-Rex: I know! And I won't shop there again.
T-Rex: But this is the power of his jerkiness: it transcends our brief meeting so that now I'm telling all my friends about it! Argh! Anyway, I'll get over it.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Seriously though! He was such a jerk!
Narrator: THAT EVENING, T-REX SEES THE REALLY JERKY GUY AT A RESTAURANT:
T-Rex: Oh my gosh, it's that jerky guy, eating alone... and he's picking his nose!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex (punchline): I've NEVER felt better about myself!




T-Rex: Alright everyone! Let's do our friggin' TAXES again, okay?
T-Rex: Let's do them every year until we die, okay?
T-Rex: And let's continue to pretend computers don't exist and that relying on PAPER RECEIPTS for proof of taxable expenses is a really awesome idea.
Dromiceiomimus: What's your alternative, a government keeps track of all your money and does your taxes for you?
T-Rex: I do recognize that's bad, but it's a FUTURE bad that must be weighed against the PRESENT bad of taxes being totally stupid and I hate them.
Utahraptor: Hi, my name's T-Rex and I'm complaining about taxes again! Surprised?
T-Rex: Oh, hello T-Rex!
T-Rex: My name's Utahraptor, and I'M gonna say something holier-than-thou soon about taxes being a privilege to pay as they allow society to function. I kinda like being WAY BETTER than everyone else, you know?
Utahraptor: No, actually - I wouldn't know.
T-Rex: ...Okay! I wanna be T-Rex again now!!
T-Rex (punchline): You're MESSING HIM UP




Narrator: RECIPE COMICS
Narrator: today's recipe:
Narrator: CHICK PEAS IN COCONUT MILK
Narrator: CUT AND SAVE!
T-Rex: Tonight is a good night I think for having Chick Peas in Coconut Milk for dinner!
T-Rex: I believe I will combine in a saucepan 2 cups of canned chick-peas, drained; 1 tomato, chopped; 4 whole cloves; 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced; and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk!
Dromiceiomimus: But aren't you forgetting about 1 1/2 teaspoons of turmeric and about a half a teaspoon of salt?
T-Rex: Indeed I am! The turmeric gives the dish its distinctive yellow colour.
Utahraptor: Then you bring it all to a boil, reduce heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes!
T-Rex: How did you know?
Utahraptor: I make this dish all the time! It's great when served over rice, and feeds 2-3 people!
T-Rex: It does indeed, old friend!
Utahraptor: Any final comments, T-Rex?
T-Rex (punchline): Only that if you want the food to be less watery, let it simmer longer - for up to 30 minutes!




Narrator: WE JOIN OUR STORY AS T-REX IS RELAYING DUMB STORIES HE'S HEARD AND BELIEVES TO BE TRUE.
T-Rex: Time to educate my peers... through the medium of incredibly true facts!
T-Rex: Hello Dromiceiomimus! Did YOU know that if you held your eyes open when you sneezed, they could pop out? Pop!
Dromiceiomimus: Really? That seems pretty improbable, since I know that eyelids closing is just incidental to the sneezing refl-
T-Rex: It's true!! They could just pop out like CRAZY.
Utahraptor: Hey, are you going around telling people stories?
T-Rex: True stories! FACTS! Want to hear one?
Utahraptor: These wouldn't happen to be URBAN LEGENDS, would they, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Of course not! Ha ha! So, um... here's a fun fact about trumpet players: each saves the contents of their spit valve in a mason jar, and chugs it at the end of the year!
T-Rex (punchline): I don't know why!




God: T-REX YOUR FRIENDS SURE ARE CRAZY EH
T-Rex: Huh? God, my friends aren't crazy. Crazy's insane. My friends are WACKY.
T-Rex: Wacky.
God: THEY'RE PRETTY CRAZY
T-Rex: Probably not, cause they're wacky!
God: LOOK IN A LITTLE BIT THE UTAHRAPTOR IS GOING TO ASK YOU AN UNNECESSARY FAVOUR AND IT WOULD BE COOL IF YOU SAID YES
T-Rex: Why? Let's get this crazy/wacky issue settled first.
God: SERIOUSLY MAN JUST DO IT AND I PROMISE I'LL TELL YOU A COSMIC TRUTH AFTERWARDS
T-Rex: God! FINE.
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex, I've a favour to ask! Can you tell me when seven minutes have passed?
T-Rex: "Okay!"
Narrator: SEVEN MINUTES LATER:
T-Rex: Seven minutes have passed.
Utahraptor: Good! My Kraft Dinner is ready!
T-Rex: You could have timed this yourself! I guess this is kind of an unnecessary favour.
God: HA HA T-REX YOU SURE HAVE SOME CRAZY FRIENDS
T-Rex (punchline): No I don't!




T-Rex: Man, I don't need that acting job anyway! I can get by on my good looks and charm ANYWAY, and "essay writing tips" are easy.
T-Rex: Easy!
T-Rex: For example, here's a tip! Maybe you could try understanding the topic at hand and expressing your views on it in a clear yet persuasive manner?
Dromiceiomimus: When I was in high school, I'd increase the font size on all my periods from 12 points to 14 points, thereby extending my paper in a way that was very difficult to detect!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! I am shocked!!
Utahraptor: Man, I just added "very" in front of my adjectives!
T-Rex: What? For reals?
Utahraptor: Of course! It was a great way to extend the length of my essay, AND it made my points more emphatic. "Trees are tall and pretty" became "Trees are very tall and very very pretty. Verily!"
T-Rex: What, you were The Mighty Thor?
Utahraptor: Only in essays, my friend! Only in essays.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, radio call in show? Did you know Utahraptor abused the word "very" in all his essays?
Off panel: I've told you: this isn't an advice show! It's a show about RVs.
T-Rex (punchline): Okay but did you not hear the rest of my question though?




T-Rex: So, if you'll excuse the pun, I think you'll agree: one cannot have a "will to" something without first a "will through" something, yes?
T-Rex: Utahraptor?
T-Rex: Utahraptor?!
T-Rex: Where the hell did he go? He was right here!
T-Rex: We were talking!
T-Rex: I was being CLEVER!
Utahraptor: T-Rex! Wait up!
T-Rex: Where were you?
Utahraptor: You were a bit boring, so I went somewhere else!
T-Rex: R-Really?
Utahraptor: Ha ha, just kidding. I went to get some smokes.
T-Rex: Since when do you smoke?
T-Rex (punchline): Since WHEN?!




T-Rex: David looked out at the edge of the sky, for yes, he lived in a world with a rim. A... "sky rim", if you will.
T-Rex: ATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A STORY ABOUT SKYRIM. I just liked the name!!
T-Rex: David was actually a tiny flightless bug on a teacup, you see, and so the edge - or "rim" of the teacup was the "sky rim" to which he and I were both referring just now.
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, I thought you were referring to the Skyrim game that's a mixture of action and high fanta-
T-Rex: NOPE, THIS IS A DIFFERENT FRANCHISE.
Utahraptor: "Franchise".
T-Rex: Yep! FRANCHISE.
T-Rex: The world will demand MORE stories of "David the tiny flightless bug on a cup outdoors". What's his origin? That'll be answered in "Skyrim: Legends". Does he ever get cold? We'll find out in "Skyrim: Shivering Isles". Has he ever crawled onto the documents of old men? Check in with "SKYRIM: The Elder Scro--
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): Man he didn't even let me close my quotation mark before he left; that is a RUDE OWNING




T-Rex: The worst part of owning a cape is having to find excuses to wear it.
Narrator: T-REX HAS A CAPE
Narrator: LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
T-Rex: Luckily, I am just the dude to manufacture such excuses! I have the perfect plan. Since it sucks to be the only dude in the room wearing a cape, I will simply start telling people that EXISTING holidays are now cape-wearing holidays. Like... Thanksgiving!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanksgiving?
T-Rex: Yes! It is now a day to give thanks AND wear stylish outmoded fashions.
Narrator: NOW IT'S THANKSGIVING!
Utahraptor: You forgot to wear your stupid cape, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aw damn!!
T-Rex: But YOU forgot to wear it too, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Yeah, but I was never going to.
T-Rex: Well! I certainly hope you'll change your mind for VAMPIRE DAY next week. I'm DEFINITELY not forgetting my cape for that!
Narrator: NOW IT'S VAMPIRE DAY!
T-Rex (punchline): Aw damn!!




T-Rex: One day Sherlock Holmes, who was the best at solving crimes if you didn't count Org (a cave man who lived 50,000 years ago) frowned!
T-Rex: But we'll pause our narrative here to discuss Org some more!
T-Rex: We said Org was a "caveman", but of course we don't really know where he lived. Caves protected materials from the elements better, which is why we have more evidence of cave-based habitation, but that's not to say that Org or his contemporaries lived exclusively in caves. His hunting and gathering lifestyle meant he had to follow food around, and he likely lived in a bunch of different places, including caves.
Utahraptor: Does Org solve crimes at any point?
T-Rex: Nope! Laws weren't invented yet!
T-Rex: But if they had, and if Org could've even once focused on solving crimes instead of on finding his next meal - Utahraptor, he would've been AMAZING. Ten Sherlocks rolled up into one, easy. He would've been a hero, instead of dying after eating some weird bug, which is what happened.
T-Rex: Meanwhile, back in the present, Sherlock Holmes was hanging around about his apartment doing drugs because he was, and I quote, "so bored".
T-Rex (punchline): THE END.




T-Rex: I have come up with the ULTIMATE COMEBACK to be used on musicians! All I have to do is wait for one to put me down, and then I can be all:
T-Rex: "Oh yeah? Well here in the REAL world, WE don't get to rest for 32 bars!"
T-Rex: Hee hee! It's funny, Dromiceiomimus, because sometimes in a song musicians get to rest for 32 bars, while here in the real world, we don't get to do that because we're not, um - trained musicians.
Dromiceiomimus: I got that, yeah! It seems like it would only work on a musician who's lazy though, right? Or who's insulting you about being lazy?
T-Rex: IT WILL WORK ON ALL MUSICIANS. Just you wait!
Utahraptor: Do you even know any musicians, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I will soon!
Utahraptor: I see! You're going to befriend some musicians, purely for the hope that one day one of them will turn out to be a jerk and insult you and then you can use your elaborate zinger on them!
T-Rex: YEP! Here's a tip: it's part of the reason WE first became friends.
Narrator: YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well HERE in the REAL WORLD, the rest of us don't have to raise the giant toenail of our second toe up while running to avoid damaging it!
Off panel: That's a racially charged insult!
T-Rex (punchline): I take it back I take it back!!




T-Rex: There's all these really interesting and amazing people out there: People who know so many awesome things and DO so many awesome things that I'm like, "HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE??"
T-Rex: That's what I'm like!
T-Rex: And I want in!
T-Rex: How did these people get to be so awesome? Did they start when they were young? When I was a kid, I just wanted to watch cartoons, but I really want to be amazing now. I want people to say "That T-Rex, you've got to know him! He's an amazing guy. So interesting, too!"
Dromiceiomimus: I'll say that!
T-Rex: It's not fair if you say it, Dromiceiomimus! I want STRANGERS to say it.
Utahraptor: I bet we could just pay someo-
T-Rex: I want strangers to say it WITHOUT COERCION.
T-Rex: And I want them to be HONESTLY MOTIVATED in their remarks, you know? I'm not looking for a quick hack here.
Utahraptor: Okay, well, then I'd say you should get interesting. Imagine the most interesting person EVER, and then strive to become that person!
T-Rex: Okay! The most interesting person ever is a woman with robot parts who can hypnotize people and her limbs turn into rockets when she flies. And, when on MOUNTAIN missions, her legs turn into skis.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): I've a long road ahead of me, it would seem




God: T-REX DID YOU KNOW THAT ANYONE CAN SEND OUT A PRESS RELEASE
God: I JUST SENT ONE OUT ALERTING THE PUBLIC THAT I AM HUNGRY
God: GOD HUNGRY IT SAYS
T-Rex: I did not!
God: IT COST ME FIFTY DOLLARS
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hi Dromiceiomimus! Did you... READ THE PAPER TODAY?
Dromiceiomimus: Nope, on account of how I'm not 65!
T-Rex: Okay, TRUE, but did you read online news today?
Dromiceiomimus: Yep. Nothing much to report!
T-Rex: ALRIGHT, I WILL STOP BEING COY. I TOTALLY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE. LET'S ALL GET EXCITED NOW, OKAY?
Utahraptor: That doesn't mean papers picked it up though!
T-Rex: WHAT.
Utahraptor: Yeah, press releases are just you saying stuff; papers will only run with interesting ones. If they haven't any real news to go with already, I mean.
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I say this without exaggeration: this has been the most disappointing day I've had all week.
T-Rex: I say this WITH exaggeration: this has been the MOST DISAPPOINTING DAY IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE, in this or any other universe, real or imagined; across all timelines, this day -- my day -- is the objective, subjective, figurative and literal worst.
T-Rex (punchline): Plus I'm out fifty bucks!!




T-Rex: Man, how great would it be to have a TATTOO? Assuming it does not go disastrously wrong, it would be super cool!
Narrator: T-REX'S BIG TATTOO
Dromiceiomimus: How would it go disastrously wrong?
T-Rex: Oh, you know - the usual. I get a tattoo of some figure in popular culture and it turns out that figure is a crazy racist. We've all been there, right?
T-Rex: We've probably all been there.
Utahraptor: Hey, I've got a great idea, T-Rex: let's get tattoos together!
T-Rex: Like, twin tattoos?
Utahraptor: No, like we both get tattoos at the same time - for moral support. Twin tattoos? You were thinking we'd each get separate halves of the yin yang symbol or something?
T-Rex: Yeah, I guess I was! Hah hah! That WOULD be pretty crazy.
T-Rex: We'd have to press our tattoos together to make them line up, and all the people would think we're married! Plus what if we got the tattoos on our lips?
T-Rex (punchline): Okay! I'm going to stop talking now!




T-Rex: The word "cybernetic" isn't JUST about abominable marriages of flesh and machine with glowing red eyes that hate all organic life, or as THEY call them, "organos".
T-Rex: At its core, it refers to a control system that adjusts itself to feedback!
T-Rex: Let's say I want my room to be at a comfortable, yet classy, 22 degrees Celsius. If I design a system that repeatedly checks the temperature of the room and either turns on a heater or an air conditioner as needed, then OH SNAP. I'VE JUST BUILT A CYBERNETIC SYSTEM.
Dromiceiomimus: That sounds like the heating system of any modern building.
T-Rex: Exactly! We're surrounded by cybernetic systems!!
T-Rex: WE WORK INSIDE THEM.
Utahraptor: We live inside them!
T-Rex: So awesome!
T-Rex: And if we view an air-conditioned room not as an empty space but as one half of a cyborg, then when I enter it, MY BODY is the other half. We join, marrying machine and flesh, working together to ensure my optimal comfort!
Utahraptor: And when you leave, you disconnect from the cybernetic machinery and become a regular dude!
T-Rex: YES. I'm basically amazing, Utahraptor. I'm a cyborg at the mall, at the office, AND IN THE COMFORTABLE, YET CLASSY, 22 DEGREES CELSIUS BEDROOM.
T-Rex: Bottom line!
T-Rex (punchline): I should be getting WAY MORE DATES




T-Rex: One day Sam read that we only use 15% of our brain! That's not a real fact, Sam! We use all of our brains!
T-Rex: But Sam couldn't hear me!
T-Rex: And she was hard at work trying to unlock the full potential of her brain!
T-Rex: Amazingly, she SUCCEEDED. While she couldn't ADD brain power, she could learn to CONTROL it better. And Sam, unlike everyone on Earth who had been born before her, now had FULL CONSCIOUS CONTROL of her entire body! NOTHING happened with her body without her willing it to be so! She was, at last, fully in control of her brain AND her self.
Utahraptor: Oh wow! What'd she do?
T-Rex: Oh, she died. She's super dead.
T-Rex: She was so frantically focused on making sure that her heart beat that she forgot to deconstrict some blood vessels feeding her brain, which pushed her into unconsciousness, at which point every single system in her body instantly stopped, because she wasn't awake to tell it to keep working, the end.
Banner: The only reason you're alive is that your body doesn't actually let you control it
T-Rex (punchline): Oh, hey! The banner I bought advertising the moral of my story just arrived!




T-Rex: SCIENCE FACT: you are covered in ants. They move to the other side when you look at your body so you can't see them, but their chitinous bodies blanket you.
Narrator: SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
Dromiceiomimus: Wait, I thought it was spiders, not ants!
T-Rex: Really? I heard ants. I mean, it could be spiders AND ants though for all I know!
T-Rex: Let's - let's say it's both.
Utahraptor: Dude! It's centipedes, but they've got the HEAD of a spider!
T-Rex: Ohhhh! That makes sense!
T-Rex: But then what about the colossal centipedes with the lamprey mouths at each end?
Utahraptor: Oh, those are the ones living coiled inside us, secretly digesting our food and then WE live off their poops, but it's SO GROSS that when scientists discovered that they were all, "NOPE, I'M OUT"
Off panel: "QUICK, TELL EVERYONE THAT THOSE ARE 'INTESTINES' AND THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY NORMAL"
Off panel: "OKAY! QUITTING SCIENCE FOREVER NOW"
Off panel (punchline): "RAD, ME TOO, LATES"




[Dromiceiomimus's daydream]
T-Rex: Hello, Dromiceiomimus! Or should I say... EMILY??
[Dromiceiomimus's daydream]
T-Rex: Because for some reason I totally believe that's your name!
[Dromiceiomimus's daydream]
T-Rex: Even though we're super close and I've known you for years and years, it seems PERFECTLY REASONABLE to me that you'd have a name you never told me. PS: I am an adult.
[Dromiceiomimus stops daydreaming, visibly irritated]
Utahraptor: Hey, you're not actually calling Dromiceiomimus "Emily" are you?
T-Rex: DUDE.
T-Rex: That's not her name! She was TOTES OFFENDED.
Utahraptor: I thought you knew I was joking!! I thought you knew "Emily"'s not her name.
Utahraptor: ...It's actually "Doctor Madame Frances Experimento, LLC."
T-Rex: INTERESTING
[Dromiceiomimus's daydream]
T-Rex: Guys, guys!!
T-Rex (punchline): Watch as I believe anything anyone tells me for at least ten minutes!!




T-Rex: Ssh! Come closer!
T-Rex: I know yet more secrets!
T-Rex: Yet more SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!
T-Rex: Okay, so let's say you're a dude or lady who often is called upon to perform CPR on someone in cardiac arrest. Nice. YOU'RE A HANDY PERSON TO HAVE AROUND. When performing CPR, you're aiming for 100 chest compressions per minute, but this is an awkward rate to hit. HOWEVER, if you hum Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust", you'll be fine! The song is simple, catchy, memorable, AND has a steady beat that runs, as it turns out, at exactly 100 beats a minute.
Utahraptor: So the professional performing CPR on me is thinking "Bum bum bum / Another one bites the dust"?
T-Rex: Quite possibly!
T-Rex: And if I ever need to perform CPR on you, you can bet I'LL be belting it out at the top of my lungs.
Utahraptor: T-Thanks?
T-Rex: No worries, man! I've got your back. Listen. It'll be a great show.
T-Rex: Although, I MIGHT change the lyrics to "Hey there guys / You know what would be great? / If this guy / would cardiopulmonarily resuscitate"
T-Rex (punchline): We share the laughter AND the tears, Utahraptor.




T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes, who really should know better by now, was investigating a crime done by his arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty!
T-Rex: Only this time, Moriarty had left RIDDLES behind for him to solve!
T-Rex: "Wow it's like he really wants to get caught," Sherlock said, "as he's now purposely leaving clues. This makes things easier for me."
Dromiceiomimus: Then Sherlock caught up with him easily?
T-Rex: He sure did!
Utahraptor: And then they fought?
T-Rex: They sure did!!
Utahraptor: And it was such an awesome battle??
T-Rex: Oh, no, not hardly. These are two people who spend most of their time imagining and/or solving crimes, not blasting quads or mixing martial arts!! The fight was two flabby guys slapping each other; it wasn't pretty.
T-Rex: Later on they were both red and sweaty, and the real cops were like, man, at least we go through basic training.
Off panel: Dang
T-Rex (punchline): They were SO SWEATY, Utahraptor!!




T-Rex: TIP: To see results from only a particular daterange, use "daterange:20010101-20051231". Past events cannot be changed by you.
T-Rex: You will not learn if they're being changed by others.
Narrator: GOOGLE CHEAT SHEET
T-Rex: TIP: Searching for "how do I die" may return results that appear to rapidly change under your gaze. Remember: knowledge of the future changes the future, destroying itself.
Dromiceiomimus: Keep staring until realities collapse into a single and now unavoidable fate.
Utahraptor: TIP: To see what dead relatives are seeing right now, turn on "incognito mode".
T-Rex: IT MUST NOT BE TURNED OFF.
T-Rex: TIP: To find results from other timelines, use "reality:onewheresheneverleft". You may encounter results where phrases like "cold", "can't breathe", or "I'm hungry I'M HUNGRY" are repeated madly, desperately.
Utahraptor: This is a side-effect of our proprietary search process and should be ignored.
T-Rex: TIP: "Safesearch" may appear to be on. YOU ARE NOT SAFE. YOU WILL NEVER BE SAFE.
T-Rex (punchline): DO NOT BE FOOLED




T-Rex: Okay so this game is called "Guess Two Thirds of the Average"! We all pick a number between 0 and 100 and guess what 2/3rds of the average of everyone else's guesses will be!
T-Rex: The winner is the person who guesses the closest number!
T-Rex: So let's say everyone else chose 100 - you'd want to choose 66.67, because that's 2/3rds of 100. But the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don't tell the other players.
Dromiceiomimus: So, 66.67 is really the ceiling - any number larger than that can't possibly win!
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: But I can assume all the other players know this too, and won't guess higher than 66.67.
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: So in that case I should choose 2/3rds of THAT, which is - 44.44?
T-Rex: But assuming the other players know that too...
Utahraptor: ...then I keep taking 2/3rds of the number, until I end up at 0.
Utahraptor: Woo
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: Who here can name a game that sounds like it's way more fun than it actually is?
T-Rex: GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE!!
T-Rex: PICK ME!
T-Rex (punchline): GUESS TWO THIRDS OF THE AVERAGE




T-Rex: What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!
T-Rex: Is that... medicine?
T-Rex: I know it doesn't work in all cases, or maybe even MOST cases, but it works with vaccination, right? A weaker version of the disease teaches your body to fight the real deal. So what I'm wondering is if I ate something disgusting, does that, you know... level me up for some REALLY insanely disgusting things in the future?
Utahraptor: You mean in terms of protection against disease, or in terms of adjusting your taste?
T-Rex: Both, I guess!
Narrator: SUDDENLY, EVERYONE REVEALS THEIR SECRET MOTIVATIONS!
T-Rex: There were some dead moths in my cereal this morning, and I'm hoping there's some way I can turn this into a positive event.
Utahraptor: I'm intrigued because the same thing also happened to me this morning!
God: MAN THAT'S CRAZY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME TODAY TOO
God: I SAID
God: WHAT THE HECK
God: AND THEN I SAID
God (punchline): I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TO EAT




Narrator: HAVE YOU EVER FAKED IT DURING SEX COMICS
T-Rex: No!
T-Rex: Have you, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Yep.
T-Rex: Yeah...
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: ...yeah, me too.
Narrator: fin
Narrator: COMICS IN WHICH EVERYBODY DIES
Narrator: a prequel
T-Rex: I say we kill all of them!
Utahraptor: Seconded!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: MOTION PASSES!
T-Rex: Meeting adjourned!
Narrator (punchline): NEXT: EVERYBODY DIES! :0




T-Rex: I, like most men, have stepped on a few tiny women in my day.
T-Rex: This I claim!
T-Rex: However, I don't claim to be misogynist! It is a problem that the very tall face when confronted with the very tiny. Sometimes you step on them by accident!
Dromiceiomimus: But you step on them on purpose! You're stepping on that house on purpose! There's no accident.
T-Rex: I AM MERELY SHADING IT FROM THE SUN, and then my foot gets heavy and tired.
Utahraptor: Okay, but now you're stepping on one!
T-Rex: Yes! I am!
T-Rex: But it's not misogyny. I'm not stepping on her BECAUSE she's a woman. Her sex and gender are incidental to the whole event! That's all I'm trying to say.
Utahraptor: I don't get why you're trying to say that though. Have you been called misogynist lately?
Narrator: EARLIER:
Off panel: [tiny] t-rex! stop stepping on us! we think you are misogynist
T-Rex: Daaamn, tiny women! That's crazy! Come closer for a sec?
Off panel (punchline): [tiny] NO DICE




Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN A PARALLEL UNIVERSE:
T-Rex: Hello everybody! I'm T-Rex and I'm here to endorse whatever product or service you'd like! Turn on your microphones and digital recorders, because:

T-Rex: Now I just wait for the money to roll in!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: I just can't get enough of this free new lifestyle that greatly complicates your children's office sex!
T-Rex: Welp, that's it for me. I had a good run, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: You did. If only you'd chosen less terrible words to say.
T-Rex: I think, somehow, we ALL knew that would be my epitaph.
Narrator: THE
Narrator (punchline): END




T-Rex: You want to know the secret to dieting? I'll tell you! The secret to dieting is NOT that losing weight is hard.
T-Rex: It is that eating is fun and delicious and let's go eat some food right now!!
T-Rex: We've evolved to find food FRIGGIN' TASTY, but YOU TOO can balance that out by remembering how gross eating is! Remember: eating is when you dig something out of the DIRTY, DIRTY GROUND and cram it inside your FACE. And if it doesn't fit? NO PROBLEM, just use parts of your SKULL that are EXTRUDING OUT THROUGH YOUR GUMS to break it down into smaller pieces.
Dromiceiomimus: That actually sounds awesome, yo! I might go do that RIGHT NOW.
Utahraptor: Yeah, it's super metal! Step 1: CRUSH FOOD WITH SKULL EXTRUSIONS.
T-Rex: Dude! I'm trying to make it sound gross!
T-Rex: Hey, when you're done eating, you know what happens? You push out WASTE through a HOLE in your BODY. A HOLE, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Yeah man: poopin! Love it. Do it all the time.
Utahraptor: Eating's the gift that keeps on giving!
Banner: EATING RULES
T-Rex: Attention, world!!
T-Rex (punchline): Uh, my life was WAY EASIER before this sassy banner followed me around all the time




Dating profile: My self-summary
Dating profile: My old profile didn't get me any dates from any of the genders, not even the ones I prefer! GUESS WHAT, JERKS??? Here's a new one, try to get more aroused by/at it this time!!
Dating profile: I'm really good at
Dating profile: Sorry I called you jerks everyone
Dating profile: I'm looking for love on a website because
Dating profile: HTTP is the most romantic of all the protocols! Wait this site uses HTTPS, does the "s" stand for "sexy"??
Dating profile: Okay nevermind I looked it up on Wikipedia and turns out the "s" stands for "secure"!
Dating profile: Okay nevermind I fixed Wikipedia! Now HTTPS stands for "Hey There, That's Pretty Sexy!", you can thank me later
Dating profile: On our fifth date I would like to
Dating profile: be respectful / touch you in some places
Dating profile: The most important quality in a romantic partner is

T-Rex: I just found out that a hurricane is expected to hit this area!
T-Rex: More specifically, the area including my house!
T-Rex: A category one! We hardly ever get actual hurricanes here!
T-Rex: I am the EXCITED one.
T-Rex: In fact - more like category fun! This is going to be awesome!
Utahraptor: Aren't you afraid?
T-Rex: Why? I'll be able to don a raincoat and hat, go outside in the storm and pretend to give pseudo-meteorological reports!
T-Rex: "Back to you, Utahraptor!"
Utahraptor: That - that actually sounds like a lot of fun.
Narrator: LATER...
T-Rex (punchline): My house!




T-Rex: I have come up with a totally original way to prevent my superintelligent email AI from trying to take over the world! And it's way more reliable than just programming in restrictions against that.
T-Rex: Tic Tac Toe!
T-Rex: I'll simply make my AI play billions and billions of games of Tic Tac Toe, and in doing so it will realize the fundamental futility of war!
Dromiceiomimus: Assuming that both players play the game optimally! And assuming that in the war, one player moves first.
T-Rex: Yes.
Utahraptor: And ALSO assuming in war, both players have units of equal strength!
T-Rex: Yes, also that.
Utahraptor: In fact, assuming that all units are exactly equal and any differences between them are purely cosmetic!
T-Rex: Yes, OBVIOUSLY. And my AI will play these games and eventually see that war is futile! The only winning move, it will realize, is to just answer my friggin' email.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: How's the Tic Tac Toe coming along, Superintelligent AI?
Off panel: [small] HEY T-REX, I WAS PROGRAMMED TO ANSWER EMAIL SO, UM
Off panel (punchline): [small] NOT WELL




Narrator: T-REX IN: "THE LIFE-SIZED CARDBOARD CUTOUT"
T-Rex: It's the perfect plan!
T-Rex: And so simple!
T-Rex: whenever I don't want to face my problems, I'll send, in my stead, a cardboard cutout of myself!
T-Rex: Ideally, he'll have an intense, yet thoughtful expression on his face. People will say, "Oh, I'd better just leave T-Rex alone: he's intense yet thoughtful!".
Utahraptor: And you believe people will fall for this, no doubt!
T-Rex: I do!
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Oh, that's clearly a cardboard cutout.
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: See, that's clearly you standing very still as IF you were a cardboard cutout.
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] just a little closer...




T-Rex: Today is the day I move into a new house! But it's also the day I say goodbye to the old place, where I've lived for years and years. I feel like someone slipped me a nostalgia-sauce sandwich!
T-Rex: A nostalgia-sauce sandwich of FREEBASED NOSTALGIA PILLS.
Dromiceiomimus: By which I take it you're nostalgic already?
T-Rex: Dude, my nostalgia's so deep that KIERKEGAARD'S still struggling through chapter one. Check it: when I move out, not only am I leaving behind the place, but I'm also leaving behind who I was when I lived there. But since I haven't moved out yet, that's still who I am right now! Somehow, Dromiceiomimus, I've developed nostalgia for MYSELF.
Utahraptor: But you'll always have memories, both of past/currently present you and of the place!
T-Rex: Hah! MEMORIES.
T-Rex: All the memories I have - both of the place AND of myself when I lived there - cannot help but to fade and alter with time, becoming truncated, inconsistent, impressionary...
Utahraptor: I suppose when you break it down that way, you are leaving behind quite a bit.
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway the place got flooded with cold sewage so whatever




T-Rex: People STILL think "For sale: baby shoes, never worn" is the saddest six word story! This is OBJECTIVELY FALSE ("Everyone just pretends to like you" is even SADDER) (AND TRUE, OH SNAP), but six words is straight-up amateur hour.
T-Rex: I can do the saddest FIVE word story: "For sale: baby shoes, unworn"!
T-Rex: Tada!!
Dromiceiomimus: Not bad, not bad. But the mettle of any true writer is measured by a sad story in a mere FOUR words.
T-Rex: Pfft. "Sale: unworn baby shoes". DONE. And before you ask for three words, may I just say...
T-Rex: "For sale: BABY."
T-Rex: SO SAD! They're selling the baby because they need the money and babies are expensive!!
Utahraptor: Ah.
Utahraptor: But let's cut to the chase: can you do a sad TWO-word story?
T-Rex: NO PROBLEM: "Baby sale". Or, for the shoes: "Debabyfied Minishoes".
Utahraptor: Amazing! But now I must give you your ULTIMATE CHALLENGE: the saddest ONE-WORD story!!
T-Rex: Watch as I invoke the sale of two (duo) new (neo) pre-baby (protonatal) artificial (pseudo) feet enclosements (circumpod or pedi)! In other words, or rather, word: DUONEOPROTONATALPSEUDOCIRCUMPEDISALE.
T-Rex (punchline): And YES, if I had a mic on me I'd be dropping it SO HARD RIGHT NOW, PEACE




T-Rex: Hallowe'en is coming up! Soon! Soonish, anyway. Hallowe'en is coming up in several months. I'm probably going as a pretty pretty princess. Anyway.
T-Rex: I'm writing a Hallowe'en story! A spooky story called "The Haunted Nun Who DIES!"
Dromiceiomimus: She lives in a haunted house, and then she dies?
T-Rex: No no, the ghost haunts her. Like a house? And then she dies and the ghost dies too so it's like, Russian nesting doll ghosts. This happens several times over the course of the narrative, so by the end, there's so many ghosts-within-ghosts that the only possible response is ULTIMATE TERROR.
Utahraptor: I'm not terrified!
T-Rex: Perhaps not yet!
T-Rex: But you're not realizing what I've unlocked here! I'm the first ever to realize that if one ghost is scary, then nested ghosts increase fright LINEARLY while maintaining a fixed surface area! It is the most terror possible per cubic foot!
Utahraptor: I GUESS that's true.
Narrator: THE BOOK'S A HIT! BUT... WHAT TO DO FOR A SEQUEL??
T-Rex: Easy! I've made all the ghosts ghosts of ZOMBIES and WEREWOLVES and VAMPYRES and MUMMIES, and then they all haunt the body of Frankenstein!
T-Rex (punchline): OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TERROR FOR THE PRINTED WORD??




T-Rex: When you break up with someone, can you still be friends?
T-Rex: Sources say, "Yep! SURE CAN!"
T-Rex: I think it's a good idea because you loved them, right? I don't see that changing just because you broke up. They still must be pretty great!
Dromiceiomimus: But - what if you broke up with them because you didn't love them anymore?
T-Rex: OKAY. But there still must be things that attracted you to them, and you can still have those as friends! Maybe they're really good at karaoke, or adept at shoe repair. That's attractive!
Utahraptor: That IS attractive!
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!
Utahraptor: But I think you're ignoring the possibility that even just seeing this person could be too painful, shoe repair aside. That happens pretty often!
T-Rex: OKAY HONESTLY I did not expect this to be this complicated. All my breakups have been clean AND totally awesome!
Narrator: THE PAST BREAKUP CAM:
[vertical motion lines above T-Rex]
T-Rex: We jumped out of an orbital tower and are now freefalling from outer space onto giant trampolines!
Off panel: I know! I think we should see other people, baby!
T-Rex (punchline): That's cool!




T-Rex: Time to invent a new cuss word, cats and kittens! And that word is...
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...BEIGE!!
Dromiceiomimus: That's it? "Beige" is supposed to be rude now?
T-Rex: It is. It's a VERY saucy verb, Dromiceiomimus. And dare I say... ADJECTIVE??
Dromiceiomimus: But how are we to describe things that are actually beige?
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: How rude
Utahraptor: You know language is a SHARED hallucination, right?
T-Rex: Right!
Utahraptor: So if you invent words it's gonna be challenging enough to get them to spread, but if you're inventing new RUDE meanings for words that already have existing and very common meanings, it's going to be almost impossible!
T-Rex: Well I have one word to say in response to that!
T-Rex: (It starts with a "b" and ends with an "eige", Utahraptor.)
Off panel: I got that, yeah.
T-Rex (punchline): (It's gonna be rude to say in front of a baby soon)




T-Rex: I am PRETTY SURE that I could be a pretty great soccer player if I really tried to be! I just haven't explored it! It's probably one of my many
Narrator: HIDDEN TALENTS
T-Rex: I'm probably ALSO really good at surfing, stand up comedy, cross-stitching and helicopter theft! I just haven't tried them because I prefer believing that I have secret talents the world hasn't seen to knowing for certain that I don't actually have anything special and secret in me waiting to be accessed.
Utahraptor: You prefer hidden talent to palpable failure!
T-Rex: Precisely!
Utahraptor: Well, why not just reframe them so they're talents that you HAD, but missed out on? Like, you could have been a great soccer player if only you'd practiced when you were a kid. So the talent's still there, it's simply your flabby aged and relatively enfeebled body that's no longer suitable!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS BEEN STEALING HELICOPTERS SINCE HE WAS EIGHT:
T-Rex: I'm so awesome at stealing copters, but I wonder if I could ever be good at stomping on things!
T-Rex (punchline): Is this finally a conundrum that CAN'T be solved with helicopter theft?




T-Rex: It's Earth Day!!
God: EARTH DAY WAS SEVERAL DAYS AGO
T-Rex: Oh okay, nevermind!
T-Rex: NEVERMIND
T-Rex: I was GONNA say "maybe recycle a little and stop peeing in the ocean" but since Earth Day is over, no worries! FALSE ALARM.
Dromiceiomimus: Peeing in the ocean isn't actually bad for the planet, dude. Fish do it all the time. Constantly, really. Did you know saltwater fish pee through their gills?
T-Rex: Um, ACTUALLY I was hoping to get through life NOT knowing that?? GOSH.
T-Rex: So it's actually... super cool to pee in the ocean?
Utahraptor: Whales do it, dude!
T-Rex: And whales ARE part of nature.
Utahraptor: Exactly. Plus, the urea in urine is high in nitrogen, which is a fertilizer for lots of oceanic plants! Science says that everyone should pee in the ocean whenever they want!!
Narrator: HAPPY EARTH DAY!! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PEE IN THE OCEAN
Narrator (punchline): BONUS SCIENCE FACT: YOU CAN ALSO PEE IN *SEVERAL* LAKES




T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for surprising my friends...
T-Rex: ...with breakfast in bed, that is!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Oh, Dromiceiomimus, you're already out and about!
Dromiceiomimus: Yep!
T-Rex: I see. That's cool, I GUESS. I GUESS You can do what you want with your life.
Dromiceiomimus: Yep!
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Hey T-Rex, do you want to -
T-Rex: Man, YOU'RE already up too?
T-Rex: This is the last time I try to make you guys breakfast in bed, okay? You suckers don't stay in bed long enough to eat a delicious breakfast surprise.
Utahraptor: Well, it's 11 am and I had things to do today. Maybe if you told me in advance...?
T-Rex: Um, maybe if you were lazier and hungrier...?
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I would like to cancel my order of thirty hash browns, please!
Off panel: Sir this is not how grocery stores work
T-Rex: Then why do you have a drive-through?
Off panel: Sir
Off panel (punchline): That is a good question




T-Rex: Who gets to wake up this morning with nausea, dizziness, and an uncanny ability to feel physically terrible?
T-Rex: Oh boy! It's me, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Okay, so I am ready to evolve into an energy being now please! Or a machine intelligence! Or a distributed cloud of pure thought! My body has been great up to now but it's time to put away childish things, especially when this PARTICULAR childish thing has become diseased and wants to throw up its stomach contents.
T-Rex: ...Seriously ready to evolve any time now over here!
Utahraptor: Have you at least taken some medicine?
T-Rex: Nope!
Utahraptor: Ah, so your first instinct when sick is to claim a desire to evolve beyond the need for mortal bodies, rather than taking even a small step towards treatment.
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: I see.
T-Rex: If you're waiting for me to apologize, I won't! Maybe if more of us worked harder on evolving beyond the need for friggin' mortal bodies, WE WOULDN'T STILL HAVE A NEED FOR FRIGGIN' MORTAL BODIES??
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway I'm off, I need to go drop a barf




Narrator: AMNESIA:
T-Rex: I can't remember a thing about myself!
T-Rex: Therefore, I will use deduction to determine my role and place in society!
T-Rex: Judging by this well-conditioned body - including thighs - and coupled with what I feel intuitively to be an impressive intellect, I can be one thing and one thing alone!
T-Rex: An astronaut!
Utahraptor: You're not an astronaut!
T-Rex: I'm not?
Utahraptor: No!
Utahraptor: You are a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
T-Rex: Seriously?
Utahraptor: Yep.
Utahraptor: Seriously.
T-Rex: Kick ass!
T-Rex (punchline): That's good too!




Narrator: HOW TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM EVER a "flow" "chart"
T-Rex: If you have a problem, turn to panel 2! If you don't have any problems, turn to panel 6!
T-Rex: If the problem involves interpersonal relationships, turn to panel 3! If not, panel 4!
T-Rex: Is the person you're relating to interpersonally REALLY at fault here? If it's your fault, fix it! Otherwise, decide if it's worth it to forgive this person and move on, or not forgive them and move on. Either way, you should all move on at some point.
T-Rex: Okay! Wow! I'm glad that's settled!
T-Rex: What are you waiting for? Turn to panel 6!
T-Rex: So I guess you've got a problem with a... machine? A system?
Utahraptor: Maybe it's a thing? Turn to panel 5!
T-Rex: Well, maybe try fixing the thing so it does what you want; that usually helps!! If you've now done that successfully, turn to panel 6! If you can't do that, then that's a new problem, and recurse one level deeper and go to panel 1.
Utahraptor: Also, maybe try Google? I dunno.
Utahraptor: Is Ask Jeeves still around?
T-Rex: Congratulations! ALL YOUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. All your current problems, anyway! There's probably going to be all sorts of problems in the future though.
T-Rex: Huh.
T-Rex (punchline): Alright! Better turn to panel 1 just to be safe!!




T-Rex: I'm creating the ULTIMATE MUSICAL MIX. It will take you on an emotional thrill ride!
T-Rex: AND WE'RE STOPPING AT EVERY STATION.
T-Rex: So, it's more of an emotional commuter train, I guess? ANYWAY, we're making a lot of stops. Hope you're not expecting to get anywhere quickly!
Dromiceiomimus: Sounds like a real thrill ride!
T-Rex: But the stations are EMOTIONS, like "nostalgia", "regret", and "that sad sad feeling that i'm not dealing / with well"! In music form!
Utahraptor: So you've got a set of songs that will make us feel every possible emotion?
T-Rex: I BELIEVE SO.
T-Rex: And it's intense. Songs are prose and music mashed up together, and people weep at poetry, right? I think that's a thing. Anyway, this is poetry set to MUSIC.
Utahraptor: Dude, I know what songs are.
T-Rex: I'm putting them in SERIES.
Utahraptor: Dude, I know what a DJ is.
T-Rex (punchline): No, my name's T-Rex




T-Rex: Humans already called dogs for besties. NICE GOING, HUMANS. NICE GOING WITH YOUR "[HU]MAN'S BEST FRIEND" COLLOQUIALISM.
T-Rex: FRIG.
T-Rex: And cat already has a best friend: itself!
T-Rex: Cow's best friend is just as obvious.
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: Cellulose-digesting protozoans, which along with other gut flora live and reproduce inside of their intestines, helping them break down plant matter!!
Dromiceiomimus: Hence the famous saying!
Utahraptor: Bee's best friend is pollinating flowers!
T-Rex: Literal symbiosis. CHECK.
T-Rex: Frig. Are there ANY animals left available for us?
Utahraptor: Just the tongue-eating parasite, and - whoops, nevermind. I just got word that tongue-eating parasite's best friend is the fish it colonizes, pinching its tongue until it fall off, so then it can become the fish's monstrous new tongue.
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex (punchline): Still kinda wish we could've called "dogs" before humans did, not gonna lie




T-Rex: I've written a draft of a new book! The book is called, "How To Be Awesome".
T-Rex: I know! It's totally the book I was meant to write!
T-Rex: In the book, I tell people that the key to being awesome is to do awesome things at awesome times.
Dromiceiomimus: You know T-Rex, you sure are using the word 'awesome' a lot. Is your vocabulary really that limited?
T-Rex: You're right! I'm not certain if overusing 'awesome' is, in fact, awesome. I'll cut it out for a bit while I consider the issue!
Utahraptor: So wait, I missed it - what's your new book about?
T-Rex: Um... it's called - "How to Be"?
T-Rex: And in the book, I tell people that the key to being is to do things at times.
T-Rex: Hey. It'll rule.
Narrator: "HOW TO BE" FAILS TO RULE IN AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS:
T-Rex: I now realize that replacing 'awesome' with a semantically similar word, rather than dropping it entirely, would have been a more viable course of action.
T-Rex (punchline): Live and learn, bitches!




T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a young woman called Little Red Riding Hood! Her parents, who were grown adults, named her after the clothes they bought for her.
Narrator: THE STORY OF LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
Narrator: as told in the 14th century
T-Rex: Red is on her way to visit her grandmother, who lives in the woods. She meets a wolf and tells him where she's going, so Wolf gets there before her and murders the grandmother. Then he DRESSES UP IN HER CLOTHES while BOTTLING HER BLOOD AND CHOPPING UP HER FLESH. Then he gets into her bed.
T-Rex: I - I don't know why.
T-Rex: This is a story for children, I dunno
Utahraptor: And then Red shows up?
T-Rex: That's still the same, yeah!
T-Rex: Only now Wolf tells Red to eat, so she unknowingly CANNIBALIZES HER OWN GRANDMOTHER. Then either Wolf eats Red, THE END, or convinces her to burn her clothes (WHAT) and get into bed with her "grandmother" (WHAT) at which point Red saves herself by saying she needs to poo and doesn't want to poo the bed (WHATTTT)
T-Rex: Red runs back to home naked and has learnt a valuable lesson: don't talk to strangers!
T-Rex (punchline): She later reflects, wistfully, that the lesson could've easily been conveyed without murder, cannibalism and zoophilia, but OH WELL!




T-Rex: God, guess what I'M going to do today!
God: UM PLANT MORE FAKE GRAVES
T-Rex: Indeed!!
T-Rex: Fake graves... for EVERYONE!
T-Rex: One of them will be of a dude with the remains of a time machine, and I'm gonna put him down at the Permian-Triassic boundary (the greatest extinction event EVER, in which 95% of all marine species and 70% of all land life became extinct)! I'm gonna make it look like this guy's time machine was responsible. It'll be all there in his notebook. "My time machine accidentally blew up and is responsible for the mass extinctions. Frig."
T-Rex: All of this will go in Dromiceiomimus's back yard, which I forgot to ask permission about!
Utahraptor: And in mine?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, in YOUR back yard I'd like to bury a skeleton, but I'm gonna give him some extra fingers and also we'll cover him in feathers. People will say, "Who was this Incredible Feathered Bird Man with the crazy fingers? Was he - was he a GOD?"
Utahraptor: 'Kay!
Narrator: LATER, ON TINY-TOWNE ISLAND!
T-Rex: Tell me honestly, Mr. Tusks: do you think my grave pranks are DEFINITELY the most awesome ideas you've ever heard?
Off panel: [small] I think they're a... TINY bit awesome, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Mr. Tusks... are you just saying that for the pun?




T-Rex: We enter a world where the internet never got invented. Broadcast media, like fries, rules supreme!
T-Rex: That's a reference to "fries supreme" which have like, sour cream on them?
T-Rex: Anyway who cares! Into this world steps an INTERDIMENSIONAL TIME TRAVELLER, who comes from OUR world. She tracks down the Google founders (all working together at Subway Restaurants) and tells them that their first, best destiny is to be doing internet stuff! "In-ter-net?" they say, pronouncing each syllable oddly so it's really clear it's the first time they've heard the word. "Is that one of the 7 fresh topping options available at every Subway location?"
Utahraptor: This story would be stronger if it didn't mention Subway so much!
T-Rex: Bah!
T-Rex: That sounds like the complaint of someone who DOESN'T intend to win the Subway Restaurants Alternate-History "Think Fresh!" Fiction Challenge!
Utahraptor: Oh crap! Has that started?!
T-Rex: Yep! And like the contest rules say: "It's not selling out: it's subbing in!"
T-Rex: My ending has the Google guys inventing the internet, but instead of http://www.website.com it's "i'mhungryforsubs://yaysubs.website.stillbigintosubsoverhere"!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex (punchline): If this doesn't win me a free footlong I'll burn every Subway to the ground!




T-Rex: A few days into the new year, and have I accomplished any of my New Year's Resolutions? The answer...
T-Rex: HECK YES, BABIES!!
T-Rex: In fact, I've accomplished ALL of them.
Dromiceiomimus: Because you didn't have any?
T-Rex: No, I actually had some!
Dromiceiomimus: Was your resolution "not to make any resolutions" or any of its variants?
T-Rex: Nope!
Dromiceiomimus: Then congratulations!!
Utahraptor: So what was your resolution?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, it was to be kinder!
T-Rex: And so far it's been working out great. I've said "thank you KINDLY" instead of just "thank you", "would you kindly" instead of "would you", and "i'mma kindly mess up this steak" instead of "i'mma mess up this steak". The response: UNIVERSALLY POSITIVE.
Utahraptor: And that steak?
T-Rex: I MESSED IT UP, Utahraptor!!
Narrator: T-REX ALLOWS HIS FRIENDS TO THINK THAT MEANS HE ATE IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY, BUT ACTUALLY HE MADE AN ERROR WHILE COOKING HIS DINNER:
T-Rex: I let myself down with this meal, but I love myself and know I'll do better tomorrow!
T-Rex (punchline): HAPPY NEW YEAR, WE'RE WHOLESOME NOW




T-Rex: It's August. I love August! EVERYONE loves August!
T-Rex: With that in mind, it's time for
Narrator: FUN FACTS ABOUT AUGUST
Dromiceiomimus: Leo and Virgo are zodiac signs for August!
T-Rex: WOOOO!
Dromiceiomimus: The Perseid meteor shower usually happens in August!
T-Rex: HELL YEAH!
Dromiceiomimus: Every atomic bomb used in war was dropped in August!
T-Rex: Wh--
T-Rex: ...What?
Utahraptor: August is named after Augustus, who despite being a Roman emperor, still died alone... as must we all!
T-Rex: What? WHAT?
T-Rex: NEITHER OF THESE FACTS ARE WOOWORTHY. I want FUN August facts, not -
Utahraptor: If 1000 people died every day in August, 31 thousand people would be dead by the time the month is out!
T-Rex: THIS ISN'T EVEN A GOOD AUGUST FACT
Off panel: The first communications satellite launched in August!
T-Rex: Finally! WOOO!
Off panel: Such satellites facilitate ubiquitous corporate and governmental surveillance across the planet.
T-Rex (punchline): DAMN IT, AUGUST




T-Rex: One day Batman was fighting a crime when another Batman showed up. "TWO BATMEN??" gasped the Joker.
T-Rex: (The Joker was there too; sorry I didn't mention this sooner!!)
T-Rex: The other Batman was glowing green, which was new. After they beat up the Joker and stopped his crimes, the real Batman quickly travelled to Coast City, where the Green Lantern lived. And sure enough, Green Lantern was there on the couch, relaxing, his power ring on. His power ring could make anything he could imagine, and he'd finally realized he could imagine up a Batman instead of just giant boxing gloves or whatever!
Utahraptor: How did the real Batman take this?
T-Rex: He was PRETTY CHEESED!
T-Rex: But GL convinced and cajoled him, and Batman finally had to admit that YES, he DID hate crime even more than he hated unlicensed infringement upon his likeness rights. And that was it: GL's Batmen became the new normal, and soon there were Green Batmen in every city.
T-Rex: Batman moved in to GL's place to better inspire him, which meant he shadowboxed while GL "observed" him, and yes it was kinda hot, and yes, we were all thinking it. THE END.
Off panel (punchline): THANK you




T-Rex: As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic dog.
T-Rex: So really, his problems were... pretty much over?
T-Rex: There was an apple stuck in his fur, but he could easily pull it out with his new canines and then gobble it. So now he'd been a dog for only a few moments and he'd already gotten a snack! Was he a good boy? He was pretty sure he was a good boy.
Utahraptor: Are you certain he wasn't a gigantic insect?
T-Rex: Uh, YEAH. They're easy to tell apart!
T-Rex: Anyway, his sister came in and was delighted to see Gregor was a dog now. His every dream had come true. She was so happy for him that for the rest of her life, she never could recall more joyous tears than those she was shedding right now. THE END.
T-Rex: P.S.: Later on Gregor moved to America and changed his name to "Clifford".
T-Rex (punchline): Literature: almost TOO easy??




Narrator: IDENTITY THEORY COMICS
T-Rex: The identity theory is that all states of the mind are identical to all states of the brain!
T-Rex: This means that for every perception, every emotion, even for every thought that I have, there is a corresponding state in my brain to match!
T-Rex: My sense of self itself is nothing more than the physical state of the chemicals and neurons in my stately skull!
Utahraptor: Your theory has appeal, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It does?
Utahraptor: Sure! It seems rational, plus it gives us hope that we could design a computer with a consciousness and - dare I dream? - a soul!
T-Rex: But it's not that simple!
Utahraptor: Sure it is! If you're hung up about consciousness, consider it to be emergent behaviour!
T-Rex (punchline): Dude, I don't even know what that is!!




T-Rex: Wikipedia is too big! There's like, over 4000 words in it!
T-Rex: It's actually way over 4000 words, if we're being completely honest with each other!!
T-Rex: We're talking MILLIONS OF WORDS. And it's like, hello, who has time to read a million words? NOT NOBODY. If Wikipedia ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE READ, it needs to be condensed. LEARNABLE. And now it's done! Yes, Wikipedia is no longer something you can get lost in (WHICH IS A BAD THING, BEING LOST IS BAD). Instead, it's something you can read and say "That was okay, I guess!!"
Utahraptor: You vandalized Wikipedia??
T-Rex: NO, I didn't "VANDALIZE WIKIPEDIA". Gosh.
T-Rex: I started my OWN Wikipedia, called "ONLY THE GOOD STUFF...IPEDIA" that's got just the solid gold hits. How heavy is the whole universe? What does a naked dinosaur look like? That and literally DOZENS of other questions are answered in convenient, superficial detail!
Website: WELCOME TO...
Website: ONLY THE GOOD STUFF...IPEDIA.
Website: YOU HAVE SEARCHED FOR: "what does a naked dinosaur look like"
Website (punchline): FRIENDO, FEAST YOUR EYES




Narrator: THE SKELETON WHO WANTED BLOOD
Narrator: a spooky tale for hallowe'en!
T-Rex: Once there was a skeleton... who wanted BLOOD!!
T-Rex: This of course was extremely frustrating for her, because any blood she drank would just run down her empty torso and pool on the ground beneath her. That's assuming, of course, she could get some - which she couldn't, because she was a skeleton and they can't move under their own power, which meant she was just big ol' pile of forgotten bones.
T-Rex: So that was frustrating too.
Utahraptor: Could she actually EXPRESS her desire for blood in any way whatsoever?
T-Rex: No. Not at all.
T-Rex: But that didn't stop her FEELING it just as keenly - a thirst that could never be quenched, an itch that could never be scratched for all eternity, where even the blessed release of death was denied her. All she could do was sit motionless, broken, forever burning and obsessing in the pain of desire.
T-Rex: Hope you kids like some existential horrooOOoor! And also vowel sounds extended to sound spoooOOooOOoky!!
T-Rex (punchline): ...Check with your parents before you listen to my taaaAAAaaAAale!




T-Rex: My new video game is amazing, and avoids all the heteronormative baggage that is usually endemic to the medium! I call it:
T-Rex: "Wow! Time to Rescues the Prince(ss)!"
T-Rex: It's so great, Dromiceiomimus! When you finally rescue the prince(ss), he or she turns to you and says "THANK YOU FOR RESCUING ME. NOW, AM I A MAN... OR A WOMAN?"
Dromiceiomimus: And then your choice determines their gender?
T-Rex: Yep! You press the button for "MAN" and he says "OH NEAT" and if you press the button for "WOMAN" she says "COOL, I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT TO BE THE CASE".
Utahraptor: And what's the gameplay?
T-Rex: "Amazing"?
T-Rex: Look, you're trying to bog me down in specifics when I'm dreaming big of amazing end sequences that let you DECIDE who you just rescued.
Utahraptor: Okay, but you're not deciding who you rescued, you're just choosing their gender identity.
T-Rex: Not in the new version! In the new version you choose who you rescued and it says "OKAY, I AM GEORGE CLOONEY. BUT AM I STILL MAN??"
T-Rex (punchline): Utahraptor! What it lacks in grammar it makes up in best game ever!




T-Rex: Here are some things that are sad!
T-Rex: Abandoned puppies, and little birds with a wing in a cast. Aww!
T-Rex: And then you throw in an orphan with a crutch! And a little girl holding the limp string and rubbery plastic remains of her only birthday gift this year, a balloon with the words "Happy Birthday, Naseem!" printed on it. The girl's name is Jenn.
Dromiceiomimus: And the balloon wasn't filled with helium! It was filled with water.
T-Rex: Brackish, swampy water! And it was tossed to her without warning and now she's drenched.
Utahraptor: And the water also drenched the orphan and puppies and birds!
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: They're all drenched, lost in sorrow - a new kind of sorrow, a grief, a sadness so intense it could smother them. Dripping wet, staring at the ground, they weep. Eventually Jenn looks up and smiles as best she can, bravely, but it's so small, so fragile. She turns and walks away, her broken balloon dragging behind her.
T-Rex (punchline): A scientist runs up, explaining that dogs and birds can't cry! But, as she examines the animals she discovers that in addition to tear ducts, they have ALSO evolved the ability to experience sadness with an intensity previously unknown on the planet. THE END.




Devil: GREETINGS T-REX I HAVE DISCOVERED SOME INTERESTING STAR TREK FACTS
T-Rex: Huh!
Devil: THAT I NOW PROPOSE SHARING WITH YOU
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: MAKE IT SO.
Devil: DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SAME WARP FIELD TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THE ENTERPRISE TO TRAVEL FASTER THAN LIGHT IS ALSO USED IN THE SHIP'S COMPUTER CORE IN A NON-PROPULSIVE MANNER TO FACILITATE FASTER-THAN-LIGHT CALCULATIONS
T-Rex: That's awesome! Like the old saying goes, once you have warp field technology, all your problems start to look like nails that could have warp field technology applied to them.
T-Rex: And it proves once and for all that Star Trek is better than Star Wars!
Utahraptor: What does?
T-Rex: Star Trek uses warp technology to speed up their computers, while the Star Wars jerks never apply hyperspace to THEIR compudroids or whatever!
Utahraptor: I believe Lucasian hyperspace is more "routes that are travelled" than "technology that can be adapted in new ways".
T-Rex: Ah, but are you considering the full Expanded Universe when you say that?
T-Rex: I don't actually know what I'm saying; I've just won Star Wars arguments before when I've said that sentence.
T-Rex (punchline): Heads up!




T-Rex: Hey everyone! I read "The Catcher In The Rye"! And I have some GREAT NEWS:
T-Rex: It's not about baseball played in a field!
Dromiceiomimus: I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT A BORING GAME OF BASEBALL PLAYED IN A TEDIOUS FIELD OF RYE.
T-Rex: Right?! Probably because of its HORRIBLE TITLE which suggests baseball - History's Most Boring Game - combined with rye, EASILY in the top 10 snorefest grains. The title makes sense when you read it, but who's gonna read it with that title?? Not me, initially!
Narrator: BETTER TITLES FOR BOOKS
Utahraptor: The Catcher in the Rye?
T-Rex: "WOW! A Likeable Sullen Teen!"
Utahraptor: Okay, what about... Oedipus Rex?
T-Rex: "The Too Too Horny King"
Utahraptor: The Lord Of The Rings?
T-Rex: "DRAGONFIGHTS! Vols 1-3"
Utahraptor: The Lord Of The Flies?
T-Rex: "CBS'S SURVIVOR Book Edition, With ALL NEW Scenes TOO HOT FOR TV!"
Off panel: The Old Man and the Sea?
T-Rex: "GIANT SEA MONSTER WITH A SPEAR MOUNTED ON ITS FACE vs AN OLD MAN - The Legendary To-The-Death Cage Match On The High Seas, Novelized Here For The First Time!!"
T-Rex (punchline): Holy crap, literature is AWESOME




Narrator: HOW TO BUILD A YOU
T-Rex: Building a you is simple, mainly because everything you are runs on simple hardware we call "a weird lump of alive fatty meat", or "brain"!
T-Rex: This (as we all know) stands for "Biological Reasoning And Intelligence Network"!
T-Rex: Now just slap that bad boy into a mobility suit made of meat with an alive skeleton inside it! Scientists call 'em "Biological Organic Domiciles for Intelligent Entities, Seriously", or "bodies". Each enables its "brain" to walk around and interact with its environment, etc, while also providing some protection for the "brain" by raising it off the dirty, dirty ground.
Utahraptor: You mentioned "brains" are made of fatty meat. Are backups to more reliable hardware offered?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: Also there is no consideration for replacements or refunds in the case of design flaws, hardware failures, or software issues.
Utahraptor: So each "you" meets at the intersection of irreplacable and fragile, and there is no recourse.
T-Rex: Don't be sad! Remember our slogan: You Be You!™
T-Rex (punchline): IT'S MANDATORY.




T-Rex: Who is getting a little tubby? Me. I am getting a little tubby.
T-Rex: I've got neck flaps!
T-Rex: Time for me to start counting my friggin' calories!
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, do you actually know what a calorie is? It's just, sometimes people use the phrase without actually knowing what they're saying.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, please. Of course I know what a calorie is!
T-Rex: It's a measurement of h- how fat you'll get?
Utahraptor: It's a measurement of food energy, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Excellent! Um, how much energy?
Utahraptor: The amount needed to heat one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. And the suggested diet has a daily calorie level of around 2000.
T-Rex: So my energy needs are equivalent to slightly heating 2000 litres of water. That's, what - a big bathtub or an extremely tiny pool?
T-Rex: Well! At least I now know that, EVERY DAY, we can each look ourselves in the mirror and ask, "Are the sum total of my accomplishments today greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub?"
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): *sigh*




Sign: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our first letter comes from Utahraptor! It reads "Hi Professor! What's the name of the force holding us to the Earth?"
T-Rex: Seriously, Utahraptor? SERIOUSLY?
T-Rex: It's gravity. Gravity is the name of the force holding us to the Earth. Utahraptor, I thought you were, like, a smart dude. I thought you were a dude who knew things, and among the things you knew were "what gravity is", "how big is a cow and how tasty too", and "what is the way to drink a glass of water but not drown this time".
Utahraptor: That letter was sent to the Professor in confidence!
T-Rex: I OPENED HIS MAIL; I ALWAYS DO THAT
Utahraptor: Anyway, I volunteered at a daycare and we helped the kids write letters. If you'll look closely you'll see the letter is not from me, but from Utahraptor And His Rad Friend Timmy.
T-Rex: ...How rad is Timmy?
Utahraptor: Pretty rad.
T-Rex: Hm. And was it you or Timmy who made all the "o"s in "Professor Science" into skulls, the "e"s into snakes, and dotted the "i" with a heart with angry eyebrows?
Off panel: That was all Timmy.
T-Rex: Dude.
T-Rex (punchline): YOU HAVE TO INTRODUCE ME.




T-Rex: Fares are not guaranteed until paid in full and tickets issued.
T-Rex: Check restrictions: tickets may be non-refundable!
T-Rex: We recommend that sufficient insurance be purchased to cover all of your travel requirements.
T-Rex: Tickets are not transferable. No one else can travel with this ticket.
T-Rex: No refunds are permitted on this fare.
Utahraptor: What are you talking about, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I'm explaining the rules of travel!
T-Rex: Well, the rules of travel for the particular set of tickets I bought. Rerouting is not permitted!
Utahraptor: But the number of people who would be interested in this is small, is it not? Small enough to be limited entirely to yourself?
T-Rex: You act as if the purpose of my life is to entertain others!
T-Rex (punchline): Any changes to dates are subject to availability.




T-Rex: How come there wasn't science fiction a thousand years ago? I gotta say...
T-Rex: The serfs certainly dropped the ball on that one!
T-Rex: It's weird, isn't it, Dromiceiomimus? I don't see any reason why past dudes couldn't have written stories about what life would be like down the road. Why couldn't they have imagined horses that, when ridden fast enough, travelled back through time and allowed you sass up your parents?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe they were too busy trying to survive?
Utahraptor: Or maybe you're just being narrow in your definition of science fiction!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: Okay, well, nobody was talking about flying cars, sure, but people did conceptualize Pegasus, and that's a friggin' flying horse. Horses being the cars of olden times, remember? Just because Peggy didn't have a scientific underpinning doesn't mean he wasn't the result of people imagining better technologies!
T-Rex: Okay, that's a good point. However! I will not concede until at least ONE ancient manuscript is uncovered that includes the line "Hay? Where we're going, we don't need... hay."
T-Rex (punchline): And then the horseman has to flip down the visor of his armour, okay?




T-Rex: What did Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre discover on Hallowe'en? Give up? GIVE UP??
T-Rex: THE AlcubSCARE drive!!
T-Rex: As you know, Dromiceiomimus, the Alcubierre drive is a construct in theoretical physics that could allow faster-than-light travel by expanding and contracting spacetime via negative mass.
T-Rex: In this joke, I speculate a more spooky version.
Utahraptor: What did the engineer discover on Hallowe'en?
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Faster than FRIGHT travel!!
T-Rex: THAT'S MY JOKE! That's my joke, only it's worse because nobody learns physics AND PLUS an engineer is more likely to design or build it, not discover it! God. GOD. Worst Hallowe'en FTL joke ever.
Utahraptor: Hey!
Off panel: Excuse me sir, but our Hallowe'en joke workshop is a comedic safe space meant to feature only constructive criticism.
T-Rex (punchline): UTAHRAPTOR STARTED IT




T-Rex: You've heard of the Justice League, but have you heard of the Justice League... of SCIENCE??
T-Rex: Albert Einstein! Marie Curie! Stephen Hawking! Others!
Dromiceiomimus: Together they fight crime?
T-Rex: No! That's a waste of resources and concussions are serious business. Together they discover fundamental properties of the universe!
Utahraptor: Can they at least fight a little crime?
T-Rex: The crime of ignorance? YES!
Utahraptor: No, like, the crime of robbing banks. The crime of murder clowns poisoning the water supply.
T-Rex: They're scientists, Utahraptor. MAYBE they could make a citizen's arrest, if the legal system permitted it. The REAL adventure is science!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: FINE. If I allow Curie to fire radiation out of her hands will you be interested?
Off panel: Can Einstein travel faster than light?
T-Rex (punchline): *sigh*




T-Rex: It's time for another one of my TRULY EXCELLENT PARTIES. And you're invited, Utahraptor! Don't worry, I'll say it for you: "I'm totally coming, T-Rex! This sounds awesome!"
T-Rex: "You're so amazing sometimes! ALL THE TIMES, actually!"
Dromiceiomimus: Um - thanks for the invitation, dude. But you totally just called me "Utahraptor."
T-Rex: What?
T-Rex: I DIDN'T.
Dromiceiomimus: Totally did! You said "And you're invited, Utahraptor!"
T-Rex: There's no way!
Utahraptor: Hah! Confusing your best male friend with your best female friend and FORMER LOVER??
T-Rex: I'M NOT.
T-Rex: Look, MAYBE I said the wrong name. You're both my friends: is it SO WRONG that I'd mix up your names?
Utahraptor: Dromiceiomimus thinks so. She's the tan one over there. You called her my name, then denied that was possible and ran over here.
Utahraptor: That's - That's pretty much where we are right now.
Off panel: Now you're perfectly still, perhaps thinking I can't see things unless they're moving, T-Rex? That's your name: T-Rex. We all took time to learn it, because we like you.
T-Rex: [thinks] Note to self!
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Friends: TOO MUCH WORK??




T-Rex: By investing my money in comic books, I ensure that several years from now, I'll have lots of money when my comic books increase in value!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Somehow - SOMEHOW - my comic books failed to increase in value??
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Ah - things don't become valuable because they're old, they become valuable because they're old and RARE. So if I want my comics to TRULY increase in value, I have to make sure everyone ELSE throws away their copies!! Only then will I taste INVESTMENT SUCCESS.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Nobody wants to throw away their comic books!
Utahraptor: Yeah, they're fun to read!
T-Rex: Aha: THAT'S my problem: people are ALREADY hooked on them! But... if I could ensure that nobody buys them in the first place, then MY copies would automatically be rare! TO TRULY EXPRESS MY LOVE FOR COMICS... I MUST DESTROY THEM??
Utahraptor: I'm not sure if that's -
Narrator: LATER, T-REX SPENDS ALL HIS TIME YELLING TO EVERYONE THAT THE ENTIRE MEDIUM OF COMICS IS GARBAGE:
T-Rex: I know, I know!! I'm sorry! CAPITALISM IS MAKING ME DO THIS
T-Rex (punchline): Once I'm rich I PROMISE to mention somewhere how much I regret this!!




T-Rex: Poker sure seems to be popular lately! Does the road to financial independence TRULY pass through Gambling Towne, USA?
God: THE ANSWER IS NO
T-Rex: There's one way to find out!
God: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING T-REX I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU RUINED DUE TO HILARIOUSLY SUCKY POKER PLAYING
T-Rex: Yeah but, you can lose at lotteries because it's just chance, right? But in poker, you can bluff! IN THEORY, I can bluff my way into the annals of poker history AND the annals of "neighbours with suspicious amounts of disposable income", ALL AT THE SAME TIME. All I need is a good poker face!
Utahraptor: And, you know, skills at poker!
T-Rex: What? I've got mad skills at poker!
Utahraptor: I believe, canonically, the minimum skill set is knowing when to hold them, as well as being aware of the proper time at which to fold them.
T-Rex: That is advice for people WITHOUT the ultimate poker face. Check this out.
T-Rex: [tiny] poooooker
Narrator: YES, THIS IS T-REX'S POKER FACE. HE MAKES EYE CONTACT, SMILES, AND WHISPERS "POOOOOKER"
T-Rex: I've doubled my money!
Narrator (punchline): RIGHT ON




T-Rex: Mammals have it pretty great! I gotta admit: I'm kinda jealous of them sometimes!
T-Rex: What with all their hair and whatnot!
Dromiceiomimus: You're seriously jealous of mammals, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Just their body hair, Dromiceiomimus! Not only can they style it so that one mammal can look totally different from another mammal, but it's gotta be the most amazing way to lose weight. If you're too fat: no problem! Just squeeze out some hair and cut it off. Instant weight loss!
Utahraptor: I'm not sure hair works that way.
T-Rex: Come on. You know PROBABLY it does.
T-Rex: The only place that the energy and matter needed to produce body hair can come from is through food! Bottom line: that's a VIABLE WEIGHT-LOSS VECTOR that I simply don't have.
Utahraptor: But you've got fingernails, right?
T-Rex: Holy crap! I DO
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I cut off my fingernails, but they were only a few grams and took weeks to grow back! It also didn't help that I chewed them up into a crunchy paste before I swallowed them though.
T-Rex (punchline): Okay I need to start keeping some thoughts to myself, like, ASAP




T-Rex: Holy crap I just came up with the best dog name ever!
God: BETTER EVEN THAN DR LEONARD MCCOY OR BONES FOR SHORT
T-Rex: Quite possibly!! You get a dog and name him...
T-Rex: ...SIR.
T-Rex: "Come here, Sir!" you'll say, and in that instant everyone will know you are both 100% FREEBASED CLASSY. Hah hah! "Sir, did you poop on the floor?" "Please, Sir, stop humping! Sir! You embarrass us both."
Dromiceiomimus: You sound like a butler.
T-Rex: Exactly! This magical dog name turns you into a gentleman! BETTER: a gentleman's gentleman!
T-Rex: Getting a dog AND getting to roleplay being awesome and well-mannered for 12-18 years? SIGN ME UP.
Utahraptor: Nice!
Utahraptor: You have to pick up your dog's poop either way, so you might as well pretend he's a millionaire while you do it. "Good poops, Sir." you can say. "Here, have a treat. You, Sir, are a good dog."
T-Rex: I don't wanna sound crazy or anything but LET'S GET DOGS RIGHT NOW!!
Narrator: BUT IT TURNS OUT GOLDFISH ARE CHEAPER:
T-Rex: Excellent swimming, Sir! More smelly food flakes??
T-Rex (punchline): Don't die on me, Sir.




T-Rex: One day, Timmy the human fell in love with Sally, who was also a human. Two humans decided they liked each other. OOH, WHAT A SURPRISE.
T-Rex: But later Timmy dumped Sally, and Sally was really sad!
T-Rex: "If only," Sally said, "if only I could find someone like Timmy, but less capricious. And perhaps with either more or less mammalian body hair, whichever one it is that I find most attractive. But as my fellow humans have not invented technologies to alter people's bodies and personalities to my specifications," she sighed, "I am out of luck."
Dromiceiomimus: Aww!
T-Rex: "It seems unhappiness is to be my most reliable chaperone," she said, sighing again.
Utahraptor: Awwww!!
T-Rex: Then she realized: overpopulation! With over seven billion humans on her planet all at once and only so many ways to be, there had to be an approximation of Timmy out there with her preferred changes implemented. So she travelled the world to find him!
Utahraptor: And did she?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: It was a sorting problem with way too many results to go through. Instead she fell for someone else, which was fine. It was all fine. There were many people out there she could be happy with, and a lot of it came down to chance.
T-Rex (punchline): THIS CONCLUDES RATIONAL LOVE THEATRE, THANKS FOR COMING




T-Rex: There sure are a lot of songs about dancing! I have probably heard at LEAST three hundred songs about dancing.
God: ACTUALLY YOU'VE HEARD 1365 SONGS ABOUT DANCING
T-Rex: Aww, you counted!
T-Rex: So why is music so reflexive? There aren't tons of paintings about PAINTING, for example. Or plays and/or movies about sitting and watching a play and/or movie, for that matter!
Dromiceiomimus: Actually T-Rex, that's not really true, and plus that's not really a fair comparison. Dancing is something you do in response to music! There are lots of paintings, films and plays that really ARE about your response to them.
T-Rex: Well! SO MUCH FOR THAT FUNNY RANT.
Utahraptor: Looks like!
T-Rex: Wait, this can still be salvaged! Utahraptor, you know what I dislike? PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO TAKE A LONG TIME AT THE CASH, FOR VARIOUS REASONS!!
Utahraptor: Yep!
T-Rex: They, um - they sure could be faster, is what I'm sayin'.
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Dear mental diary: everyone here sucks. Maybe I should take my act to the grocery store!




T-Rex: Hello future generations! Depending on how far in the future you live you may know me as a senior citizen or even a combination skeleton/ghost, but at the time I'm saying these words I'm a young dude! I'm young and cool!
T-Rex: I'm kissin' on babes, like - often!!
T-Rex: I mention this only to establish my credentials as a dude who is worth listening to. And today I come to you with a question, future generations: PRECISELY HOW SICK ARE YOUR VIDEO GAMES??
T-Rex: They're probably pretty sick, huh?
T-Rex: They're like - mad sicky? They're so great that you're like "ahh, so sick!!"?
Utahraptor: Are you... expecting an answer?
T-Rex: I should make that more clear!
T-Rex: Please let me know how sick your video games are, future generations, by sending a message back in time to this precise moment. Riiiiight now. Now.
Utahraptor: ...
Utahraptor: No dice, dude.
T-Rex: OH MY GOD THE VIDEO GAMES WERE TOO SICK TO TAKE A BREAK FROM, AHHHHHH, THE FUTURE RULES
T-Rex: AHHHHHHHH
T-Rex (punchline): I CAN'T WAIT TO LIVE THERE AND BE OLD, BUT ALSO COOL, DUE TO MY CONTINUED INTEREST IN YOUTH CULTURE




T-Rex: Okay, so I can't write love poetry. That's fine. There are plenty of dudes who will write it for me. But I can PROBABLY write a pretty kick-ass SHERLOCK HOLMES story!
T-Rex: I will call it, "Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Mummy's Curse!"
T-Rex: In it, Holmes and Watson will come across a Mummy who has a curse, and then there will be a mystery involving the curse. Did the Mummy really kill from BEYOND THE GRAVE? Let's ask Sherlock; I'll bet he knows.
T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes will solve the case using deduction, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: This is just a regular detective story! It's more Hardy Boys than Sherlock Holmes.
T-Rex: Truly outrageous!
Utahraptor: Seriously, man! Sherlock's character is defined in dozens of stories and then in like a billion fanfiction sequels. He's got more personality traits than "good at detection", and if you don't acknowledge that, why call him "Holmes" in the first place?
T-Rex: BECAUSE NOBODY WILL READ MY STORY OTHERWISE??
Off panel: T-Rex, it is I, Sherlock Holmes! I deduced an elementary way to become real, just to ask you to stop writing your story!
T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes!! Can you describe me as "the Napoleon of RHYME"?
Off panel (punchline): I can but try!




T-Rex: Here is a fact: sometimes we love a thing, and then that thing isn't there anymore.
T-Rex: This causes us to experience an emotion called "grief"!
T-Rex: Terrific, right? Every time we love something we know we're setting ourselves up for one of two conclusions: we'll eventually feel grief when that thing is gone, or maybe, just maybe, we'll DIE FIRST and leave everyone else to feel grief instead.
T-Rex: Yaaaaaay
Utahraptor: There's a third option, my friend!
T-Rex: Oh, perfect! Just what I'm looking for. Lay it on me!
Utahraptor: Gradually stop loving that thing just a little bit more each day, ideally without even noticing! Then one fine day you'll wake up and realize there's no grief ahead of you anymore, but only a grey, blank indifference.
T-Rex: Can't wait, dude! But in the meantime, I've the following demands:
T-Rex: 1) Ability to stop being sad on demand
T-Rex: 2) No regret allowed between hours of 10pm and 4am
T-Rex: 3) All good emotions felt all the time forever
T-Rex (punchline): 4) THANKS IN ADVANCE




Narrator: RHONDA from "HELP ME RHONDA"
T-Rex: Rhonda always had greater ambitions than helping men who LITERALLY CALL THEMSELVES "BEACH BOYS", and who DATE AS A GROUP, to get over another woman; she now works as an English professor.
Narrator: The Women Of Popular Music: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
Narrator: EILEEN from "COME ON EILEEN"
T-Rex: Young Eileen quickly left the bar full of adult men creepily complimenting her on how she's "full grown" and blaming her for their thoughts that "verge on dirty" as if that's HER fault. She later moved to Canada and, with her girlfriend, co-founded a successful startup in the biotech space.
Narrator: LAYLA from "LAYLA"
Utahraptor: Moved to NYC and changed her name to "Delilah".
T-Rex: Yep!
Narrator: DELILAH from "HEY THERE DELILAH"
T-Rex: Delilah's boyfriend did graduate in two years, just as he predicted, and while he never DID pay the bills with his guitar, the two of them opened a small music shop, and now they pay their bills... together.
Utahraptor: Aww! Good on her.
Narrator: MS. CLARENCE JACKSON from "SORRY MS JACKSON"
T-Rex: For some reason Ms. Jackson never did accept the apology of a man who proved incapable of getting through said apology without mentioning his dick and then bragging about oral sex.
Narrator (punchline): THE END




Narrator: HOW TO REVIEW A BOOK
T-Rex: First off, you need to read the book! I know, reading is like watching a movie with the explosions turned off, but just power through!
T-Rex: Then you need to choose what you liked about the book!
T-Rex: Maybe you liked the characters. Maybe you thought the plot was neato! Maybe your favourite part was some of the words that the author chose to say things with. Mention that in your review!
Dromiceiomimus: "I liked the words and the plot was neato skeet-o".
T-Rex: ANOTHER A++ REVIEW!!
Utahraptor: "I read a book and formed opinions about that".
T-Rex: HAVE THIS PULITZER PRIZE!!
Utahraptor: "I worry that the standards are too low here, and I'm not challenged to be the best person I can. I don't want to feel like I'm the smartest person in the room. I wanna feel like I'm the dumbest".
T-Rex: A++++++ WOULD CONSIDER MY OWN SELF-WORTH AGAIN!!
Off panel: Umm... "This book had Batman in it, but Batman is a stupid character for crybabies who poop"?
T-Rex: A+++ GOOD REVIEW BUT ENDED OUR FRIENDSHIP FOREVER
T-Rex: Alternatively!
T-Rex (punchline): A++++ BUT I WILL NOT BE MADE TO FEEL SHAME ABOUT MY BODILY PROCESSES, LOL




T-Rex: People don't want traditional! They want NEW and SEXY. If people wanted traditional we'd all be driving around on Model T horses or whatever.
T-Rex: With that in mind, I have started a new religion: Buddhism 2!
T-Rex: Buddhism 2 is like Buddhism, but bigger, badder, and better than ever. If you liked the four noble truths, you'll LOVE that we've doubled them up, giving you eight sexy new truths to choose from! And if you believe suffering is caused by desire, well then GET READY TO SUFFER, because we've taken Nirvana and kicked it up to the max. You won't believe your eyes!
Utahraptor: Wow, you can write bad copy like nobody's business!
T-Rex: Thanks, man!
T-Rex: Buddhism 2 ALSO includes the startling revelation that Buddha had a daughter. Wow! She's the slim and sexy new smilin' face of Buddhism, now in a tiny red bikini! Would you like to know more?
Utahraptor: No thanks! I make it a rule not to join religions started by my friends or peer group.
Narrator: LATER: T-REX GETS VISITED BY A GANG OF BUDDHISTS:
Off panel: Stop making crappy sequels to our religion!
T-Rex: Buddhists! Are you interested in trading up to a religion with SIXTEEN COLLECTABLE CUPS?
Off panel: a little
Off panel (punchline): i mean NO




T-Rex: The whole reason anyone becomes a visual artist is because they want to draw something cool. THIS IS A FACT. Artists love drawing cool things!
T-Rex: It therefore follows that artists work their whole career towards drawing the COOLEST thing!
T-Rex: And what is this coolest thing? I'm glad you asked. It's a -
Dromiceiomimus: - It's a hotdog in shades hoversurfing on the rings of Saturn.
T-Rex: ...okay, that's WAY cooler than what I was going to say.
T-Rex: [small] ...which was a picture of me giving a thumbs up and one of my thumbs is labelled "THE ECONOMY".
Narrator: DROMICEIOMIMUS'S VISION OF ULTIMATE COOLNESS BEGINS TO SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE
Narrator: THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BRINGING A HOT DOG TO LIFE AND TEACHING IT HOW TO SURF - MUCH LESS WEAR SHADES - ONLY ADDS TO ITS ACHING BEAUTY, ITS STAGGERING VISION, ITS DIZZYING SENSE OF A PLATONIC IDEAL SOMEHOW GIVEN A PERFECT AND FINAL FORM
Narrator: THERE IS NOWHERE TO GO FROM HERE; ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEM HOLLOW AND ASHEN AS ALL SENTIENT LIFE BECOMES OBSESSED WITH THIS ONE IMAGE
Narrator: THE END
Narrator (punchline): NO REGRETS




Narrator: BIKING TIPS FOR TEENS
T-Rex: Teens! Do you love biking? Sure you do!
T-Rex: You're a teen!!
T-Rex: But did you know that biking without a helmet can be dangerous? Actually biking with a helmet can be dangerous too. Biking, regardless of helmet status, can be dangerous.
Dromiceiomimus: Getting out of bed can be dangerous.
T-Rex: Getting out of bed can be dangerous, teens!!
Utahraptor: Who are you talking to? There's - there's no teens here.
T-Rex: But there might be teens ABOUT here!
T-Rex: You know, teens walking by on their way to somewhere else.
Utahraptor: Eavesdropping teens.
T-Rex: Yes! Eavesdropping teens who'll overhear our conversation and say "Holy smokes! I'd better learn to love safety!" and then, they go and learn to love safety.
T-Rex: Do they do it in the comfort of their own home? Do they do it in the "skate park"? Who knows?! They're teens!
Off panel: Wow, when did you become an old man, T-Rex?
T-Rex (punchline): It is something I am experimenting with




Narrator: T-REX AND HIS WACKY DINOSAUR FRIENDS
T-Rex: Time to visit all my wacky friends!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Oh hey, Dromiceiomimus, my wackiest of wacky friends! What are you up to? Some crazy scheme, no doubt!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm selling unwanted possessions on eBay!
T-Rex: Ha ha! That's WACKY.
Utahraptor: T-Rex!!
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
T-Rex: YOU, I think, are surely my wackiest of friends! What news?
Utahraptor: The school is burning down! Quick, we need your help to fight the fire!
T-Rex: Certainly! But I warn you: a school burning down?
T-Rex (punchline): Pretty wacky!




T-Rex: Sometimes when you love someone a lot, you're willing to say, "I'm pretty sure I'm going to love you until I'm dead, EVEN IF I don't die for a totally long time!"
Narrator: PROPOSING MARRIAGE
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Sometimes you're willing to say that although the future is unknowable, and although our cells are replaced by new ones so in the end the person we are at 60 isn't really the same person we were at 20, not really, not even physically, although there are elements of continuity in personality, sure, but what is that except how we respond to events, and that's just habit --
Dromiceiomimus: THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS CARD LOVES YOU.
T-Rex: Yes!! The person who sent this card loves you so much!
Utahraptor: They love you more than anyone on the PLANET!
T-Rex: And so it comes down to this: they want to explore the rest of their life with you. A marriage can be anything you want it to be, and they want to build one with you.
Utahraptor: Aww!
T-Rex: Will you marry the sender of this, the most romantic of the free web cards?
Checkbox: Yes!
Checkbox: No.
Checkbox (punchline): Who is this, I don't recognize the from address at all




T-Rex: You know what's better than school? Not being in school but still learning!
T-Rex: Yes indeed! I have decided to become AUTODIDACTIC.
T-Rex: This means that I eschew formal schooling and learn on my own terms at my own pace, Dromiceiomimus! I learn things that interest me and don't rely on someone else to tell me what I should and should not know.
Dromiceiomimus: Didn't you graduate years ago?
T-Rex: Shhh!
Utahraptor: Hey, why are you setting up learning on your own and learning in a classroom as opposites?
Utahraptor: It's not like you can't do both! Learning is learning, and some ways work better for some people.
T-Rex: Well, I've also incorporated into my autodidacticism a distrust of schools as inefficient, repressive institutions. It's part of my new "damn the man" persona!
T-Rex: I can demonstrate, my friend! Ask me where I picked up a word like "autodidacticism"!
Off panel: Where'd you pick up a word like "autodidacticism"?
T-Rex (punchline): Not from any SCHOOL!




T-Rex: Oh crap! Did you forget not to be single this year? Did that just plain slip your mind, champ?
T-Rex: WELL TOO BAD FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S
T-Rex: VALENTINE'S DAY
T-Rex: AND WE NEED TO BE ALL ABOUT THAT CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED "AFFECTION MORTALS HAVE FOR THINGS THAT LIKE THEM WILL ALSO DIE"
Dromiceiomimus: You mean love? Possessive monogamous romantic love?
T-Rex: All sorts of love! Even NON-possessive NON-monogamous NON-romantic love!
Utahraptor: What's that?
T-Rex: PALS.
T-Rex: Pals have other pals and you don't mind when they pal around - IN FACT, you want them to, because that means more pals for you! And it's not romantic either: it's just pals, man! Let us celebrate PAL LOVE, the exact opposite of what Hallmark wants you to buy.
Utahraptor: Hooray for pals!
Narrator: SOON:
Off panel: "Thank you for being a friend. Travelled down the road and back again. Your heart is true: you're a pal and a confidant." Aww, what a nice card you made, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): It's totally plagiarized but the sentiment remains totally real!




Narrator: TWENTY YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: What do I think prejudices will be like twenty years from now, well within the new millennium?
T-Rex: I'm glad you asked, self!
T-Rex: I can say this: people who save their files as ".jpeg" instead of ".jpg" will be ostracized for wasting their storage space and MY time.
Dromiceiomimus: Oooh! And any time someone writes "(:" instead of ":)", others will demand to know what in the world they're possibly trying to prove.
T-Rex: PERFECT.
Utahraptor: I predict that those without wetware cyberhacks will be mocked by those who have them!
Utahraptor: I also predict that the scientists who were smart enough to invent bioimplants but stupid enough that the best name they could think for them was "wet" "ware": they too shall be mocked.
T-Rex: I for one can't wait for the future to arrive! Who KNOWS what prejudices we'll develop by then??
Narrator: PRESENT DAY:
T-Rex: Oh no
T-Rex (punchline): Oh no oh noooooo




T-Rex: One day, the land on Earth and the water on Earth got swapped! All ground became ocean, and all ocean became ground!
T-Rex: Whoops!! Turns out this was fatal to basically everyone?
T-Rex: But there were a few survivors: people in planes and and those on beaches, where the land/water inversion had a minimal effect. Most, however, suddenly found themselves under miles of water while those in boats found themselves freefalling towards what had previously been the ocean floor!
T-Rex: It was rough friggin' times for anyone who'd gotten used to being alive!
Utahraptor: How did this happen?
T-Rex: Quickly! Oh, AND unexpectedly!
T-Rex: Switching from a planet of mostly land to a mostly water planet caused mass extinction, and -
Utahraptor: Wait, don't you mean "to a mostly-LAND planet"? That's what you get if you flip Earth.
T-Rex: No, Utahraptor: this isn't a story. It's HISTORY. OUR world IS the flipped world!!
Narrator: LATER, THE FOSSIL RECORD SHOWS PRECISELY ZERO EVIDENCE OF AN EARTH/WATER FLIP:
T-Rex: Man! History is the "um actually" of academic disciplines.
Off panel: Um, ACTUALLY, I'm pretty sure that's science.
T-Rex (punchline): ARGH!!




T-Rex: English has been blessed by many ways to say "I say, that is a thing that is hot". But sometimes it can be hard to remember where each expression ranks in terms of relative hotness! But check it out:
Narrator: HOT METAPHORS
Narrator: as arranged by increasing hotness
T-Rex: At the cold end of the scale we find "hot as the Dickens", because Charles Dickens was a real guy who is dead now, so he is a skeleton man. Skeletons are the temperature of the ground, which is cold and boring. Let's say... 10 degrees celsius, 283 Kelvin.
Dromiceiomimus: I thought "dickens" was a minced oath meaning "devil"?
T-Rex: UH, NOT ANYMORE
T-Rex: Next is "hot as fish grease": 463 Kelvin, or 1.5 boring grounds stacked together.
Utahraptor: Pretty hot!
T-Rex: Then we have "hot as hell", which being at the centre of the Earth is around 6200 Kelvin, or 13 fish greases. This is followed by "hot as the sun": 15 million Kelvin, which Science dictates is about 2400 hells, 32 thousand fish greases, or 53 thousand skeletons.
T-Rex: Finally, we have the hottest thing: balls. If you have ever tripped balls, you know how hot they can be.
T-Rex (punchline): They can be hot as balls.




T-Rex: Robyn bought a haunted mansion on the hill, and it was haunted by several spooky ghosts: a woman in white, a man in chains, and a knight in rusted armour.
T-Rex: They returned every night to haunt her for years!
T-Rex: Judging by their clothes, they all died centuries ago. They rattled their chains, they slammed doors, they threw plates around, but one thing they never did, Robyn noticed, is EAT. Ghosts consumed no energy, but could still haunt houses indefinitely. Robyn realized that besides being paranormal, they were also paraENTROPIC: ghosts were outside the laws of thermodynamics!
Utahraptor: They're doing work without costing energy anywhere!
T-Rex: EXACTLY. Free energy, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: Now, ROBYN'S old-time ghosts refused to ride bicycles hooked up to generators, but before long she'd moved to France and rented houses belonging to deceased Tour de France champions, who took to the bicycles quite easily. And that, dear reader, is how our post-scarcity utopia was created.
Off panel: I thought screaming cursed blood skulls did that in your last story.
T-Rex: This one's way more sustainable. You get ghosts for free, just by dying!!
T-Rex (punchline): DUDE, IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID.




T-Rex: I was asked by a friend of mine how he could tell his sweetheart that he loves her in a new, exciting way! He's worried that he's said the same old thing too often, and that it's getting stale.
T-Rex: I assured him that there are infinitely-many ways to say "I love you"!
T-Rex: For instance, you could say "I love you", but you could also say "I really love you"! Or, for that matter: "I really really love you"!
T-Rex: Therefore, since you can have an arbitrary number of 'really's, there are an infinite number of ways to say "I love you".
Utahraptor: That's not very helpful, is it? You're just adding the same adverb over and over again!
T-Rex: So?
Utahraptor: So, no woman would sit around while you said "really really really really" for two hours. Anyway, after the third 'really' you move from "emphatic" to "damn creepy"!
T-Rex: Well that explains why that woman at the supermarket never replied to my letters!
T-Rex (punchline): Also they were anonymous!




T-Rex: Sherlock Holmes knocked on T-Rex's door. "I deduce you are home, good buddy!" the world's greatest detective except Batman said.
T-Rex: "Guilty as charged!" T-Rex laughed, opening the door!
T-Rex: "I need your help with another one of my mysterious cases," Sherlock said. "Again?" T-Rex sighed, smiling and motioning for Sherlock to come in. "Well, I guess nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person!" T-Rex said. Sherlock sat down, pulling out a notebook labelled "ALL MY GREATEST LINES ARE STOLEN FROM T-REX".
T-Rex: "Oooh, dude, I'm gonna steal that," Sherlock said.
T-Rex: "Tell me about the case," T-Rex said!
Utahraptor: "Okay I will!!" shouted Sherlock, stripping naked.
T-Rex: What? No he didn't! Sherlock Holmes kept his clothes on.
Utahraptor: No, he's naked now. He's asking for your help in "The Mystery of The Two Close Male Friends Who Got Naked With Each Other; The Mystery Was How It Was SO FRIGGIN' HOT".
T-Rex: *gasp*
Narrator: LATER, AT THE PUBLISHING HOUSE:
Off panel: I'm sorry, this reads like historical fiction that decided half-way through it was going to be erotica.
T-Rex: Yes! Yes.
T-Rex (punchline): You say that like it's a bad thing??




T-Rex: Hey God! Here's something your precious "science" can't prove!
God: WHAT
God: WHAT
God: SINCE WHEN IS IT MY SCIENCE
T-Rex: Prove to me that the world wasn't created 1 millisecond ago!
God: WELL I MEAN THE FACT YOU'RE NOT 1 MILLISECOND OLD IS WHERE I'D START WITH THAT ONE
T-Rex: Doesn't work! You could've JUST NOW set up the universe and given everyone fake memories! And like, MOMENTUM.
God: THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK JUST SO I CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
God: THIS FRANKLY TWO OUT OF A POSSIBLE FIVE STARS CONVERSATION
Utahraptor: I'd be more concerned with the chance our universe is OLDER than we think, not younger!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: You know how in games sometimes you'll save right before your guy dies, so you'll keep restoring over and over, hoping that this time you'll be able to save your dude?
T-Rex: Holy crap. We could be reliving the same few moments over and over and have NO IDEA.
Utahraptor: Even death would offer no escape.
God: HAHA WOW
God: OH MAN IT'S LIKE
God (punchline): IMAGINE CARING THAT MUCH ABOUT ONE SINGLE DUDE




God: IT'S AGAIN TIME FOR ROMANCE TIPS WITH T-REX
T-Rex: Alright, alright. Fine.
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: Love!
T-Rex: It's PROBABLY worth the effort??
T-Rex: Okay, so everyone's looking for love, right? This being the case, the smart move isn't to join that huge amorphous crowd. The smart move is to let those suckers find you! You need to make yourself FOUND. You need to make yourself a catch!
Dromiceiomimus: How do you do that?
T-Rex: Easy! BE AWESOME.
T-Rex: And if you're not yet awesome, get that way! Better yourself: explore things that interest you, whatever!
Utahraptor: Yes!
Utahraptor: If you put all your points into making yourself more AWESOME, then even if you're still single at the end, who friggin' cares? You're awesome now.
T-Rex: Plus, you're doing all the stuff you want. If you don't have a sweetie, it doesn't matter: life is awesome! You're awesome!!
T-Rex: Yes sir!
T-Rex (punchline): In conclusion: manipulate others, events, and yourself to get what you want, the end




T-Rex: What should I do if I see someone littering? Every time I do something different and every time it feels like the wrong thing to do.
Narrator: LITTERING COMICS
Narrator: all over the internet
T-Rex: I've tried doing nothing, but that left me feeling like a frustrated milquetoast pushover! I keep wanting to pull the "excuse me, you dropped this" line, but it is sort of an aggressive thing to do, especially if the way I say it makes it clear I think it was, indeed, NO ACCIDENT. I could see that leading to a confrontation, and I don't want to be that guy who throws punches over empty cans of Coke!
Utahraptor: You could throw down over disgusting used Kleenexes!
T-Rex: But it's an overreaction, isn't it?
T-Rex: I don't know - littering's this perfectly situated thing where it's not THAT big a deal taken individually, but a really antisocial thing when taken on a larger scale.
Utahraptor: And yet, not really, when you compare it to, say, murderin' dudes.
T-Rex: Exactly! I don't know how I should react when confronted with a small instance of a small crime, but which still bothers me. All I can think of is to sneak poo bugs into the dude's food?
Off panel: Poo bugs aren't an all-purpose revenge tool, T-Rex.
T-Rex (punchline): You take that back!!




T-Rex: Since time immemorial, the greatest minds of each generation have, at one point or another, wondered this:
T-Rex: DOGS: WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?
T-Rex: If you know what dogs are thinking then please let me know. My email address is whataredogsthinking@dogswhataretheythinking.dogs.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you bojo! That's not a real email address!
T-Rex: Aw geez! I was thinking about what dogs are thinking when I said that and got confused!!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, want to get lunch? We can ponder what dogs are thinking together!
T-Rex: Rad!
T-Rex: I'd love to do that. There's a new place that opened up that sells what are dogs thinking about wrapped in a dogs: I wonder what they're thinking about right now??
Utahraptor: T-Rex it's happening again!
T-Rex: Oh no! WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING... when dogs are choosing what to think about?!
T-Rex: Hee hee!
T-Rex (punchline): That one was on purpose!!




Devil: I BRING YOU NUMEROUS GREETINGS T-REX
Devil: AND A QUESTION I WISH TO POSE TO YOU
T-Rex: Aw man! What do you want?
Narrator: T-REX AND THE DEVIL STAR IN: "ABANDONWARE ADVENTURES"
Devil: I SIMPLY WISH TO ASCERTAIN YOUR OPINION ON CLASSIC GAMING EMULATION
Devil: THERE ARE OFTEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A GAME'S COMPANY HAS FOLDED BUT THE GAME ITSELF REMAINS POPULAR
Devil: IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ETHICAL TO COPY AND EMULATE THE GAME IN QUESTION
T-Rex: T-That's actually a really interesting question!
Utahraptor: Which is, T-Rex?
T-Rex: The question the Devil just asked me about "orphaned" games!
T-Rex: It's actually just a subset of the larger problem of orphaned works still under copyright. How can such works be dealt with when it's impossible or prohibitively expensive to figure out who owns the rights?
Utahraptor: Man, I'll leave you to it! I'm going elsewhere to have an INTERESTING conversation.
T-Rex: But - copyright law as applied to software IS really interesting! Come on!
Devil: I TOO WILL LEAVE FOR I MERELY WISH TO PLAY CLASSIC NES GAMES FOR FREE T-REX
Devil (punchline): HOLY MOLEY




T-Rex: I have a new life goal: to become a hairdresser!
T-Rex: Scratch that: to become the BEST HAIRDRESSER EVER!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, um, you and I don't really have -
T-Rex: Before you go any further, let me clarify that I'll be a hairdresser for MAMMALS. These guys have ALL SORTS of hair coming out of ALL SORTS of places. I'll trim it and they'll say "Wow, this hair cut has made me a WAY better looking mammal! Thanks for trimming the hair off my head, sweat glands and mammaries!"
Utahraptor: I don't understand why you keep lusting after these doomed careers, my friend!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: You have no hair and want to be a hairdresser. You have stubby arms and want to be a boxer. Why not get a job that plays to your strengths?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! I have nothing BUT strengths!
Utahraptor: Okay, fine, enjoy your hairdressing. You just stepped on one of your customers.
T-Rex: Dear diary!
T-Rex (punchline): My new job is getting... a little hairy.




T-Rex: When movies were invented, people were really excited! For the first time, we could capture life, in real time, as it was happening.
T-Rex: This was a super big deal!
T-Rex: Even if the films were black and white, folks could see the potential. Essays were written extolling how movies with sound and colour were just around the corner, and they'd be cheap to make, and when that happened we as a species will have done something amazing: we will have CONQUERED DEATH ITSELF.
Dromiceiomimus: Seriously?
T-Rex: You'd be able to summon up loved ones with a film projector! How can they be dead when that survives?
Utahraptor: A movie isn't the same thing as a person!
T-Rex: You and I know that from experience!
T-Rex: But if you can remember how only the lucky ones got a single (very expensive) picture taken during their lives - if that - MOTION pictures for everyone would seem pretty amazing.
Utahraptor: I kinda wish we still had that much optimism in invention! Nobody's saying 3D movies will conquer death.
T-Rex: Man, now when I see an ad for a 3D movie I'll say "we, as a species, could've spent the time and money wasted on that on conquering death"! That's not gonna make me any more popular.
Off panel: You could say it after every ad, really.
T-Rex (punchline): Maaaaaaaan




T-Rex: So, tiny bug on my nose, how was your day today?
Morris: oh t-rex it was really a challenge for me today. but, you can - my name is morris, if you wanted to call me that. morris the bug
T-Rex: Pleased to meet you, Morris!
Morris: gosh i'm pleased to meet you, t-rex! and yes, to answer your question it was a real challenge for me today. i tried to park my car by the grocery store so i could buy some groceries but then i couldn't find where the parking meters were and i looked everywhere and finally i asked some people to help but none of them knew where the parking meters were either! so it was real confusing
Dromiceiomimus: Didn't the grocery store have a parking lot, Morris?
Morris: yeah but i didn't find that out till afterwards and i'd already made an awful embarrassment of myself by asking everyone where the meters were! sometimes i get a little confused is all
T-Rex: That's okay, Morris! Everyone gets confused sometimes!
Utahraptor: Did they have the groceries you wanted?
Morris: well i dunno because i got so flustered from my mistake that i ended up just going home, empty-handed
T-Rex: Aww, Morris!
Utahraptor: I'm Utahraptor, by the way. Pleased to meet you!
Morris: shucks i've never met so many people before all in one day! i'm morris, and i'm just a little bug who tries real hard
T-Rex: If you ever need some help getting groceries, Morris, I bet we could help you out!
Morris: that's awful nice but it turned out that bugs don't even shop at the grocery store! i must have gotten myself mixed up with a show i saw or a movie or something because we catch our food ourselves
T-Rex: Is that why you're on my nose? To look for food?
Morris: no, i'm just here to get out of my house a little plus i wrote my address on my wrist but i must have written it in smudgey ink or something cause all i see now are smudges! i've probably made a big mess of things again
Morris (punchline): i can just tell




T-Rex: Learning a language is hard! It is especially hard with your first language, when you're a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you.
T-Rex: It's not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!
T-Rex: It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us, but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close. So the result is we (as learners) end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with, but which is slightly different than those that surround us!
Utahraptor: How slight a difference are we talking about here?
T-Rex: That depends on the learner, I guess!
T-Rex: Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed, because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you. But less-frequent parts will be more malleable, which explains why languages evolve so quickly!
Utahraptor: Because a language is never passed down, just an approximation of a language.
T-Rex: Yep! Of course this has changed a little with the advent of grammar books and formal schooling, but it's still there. For example, I might think the word 'tenet' is enraging!
Off panel: Really? You think 'tenet' is-
T-Rex (punchline): Screw you!!




T-Rex: How can we engage with our favourite feelings like we engage with our favourite brands if those feelings don't have clear statements of brand identity that we can pivot conversation around??
T-Rex: HOW
T-Rex: Anyway I fixed reality! Feelings have slogans now!
T-Rex: Feel Ecstasy. Feel Alive.™
T-Rex: It's a still lake at dawn. It's the weekend sun warming your bedsheets. It's Calm.™
T-Rex: Every moment of every day, there's always one feeling you can count on. Welcome to Self-Doubt.™
T-Rex: Pride: Because You're Worth It.™
Utahraptor: Laziness: Because Laziness.™
T-Rex: Empathy: When Your Own Feelings Just Aren't Enough.™ Greed: You Deserve That.™ Live Life. Make Mistakes. Feel Regret.®
Utahraptor: We took the sadness you like and mixed it up with the surprise you love! Get ready... for Disappointment.™
T-Rex: Happiness: The End-Game of All Intelligent Life!™
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): I'm serious, once they invent the happy pill I'm out




T-Rex: Man, forget verbs!
T-Rex: You heard me!
T-Rex: From now on, I am all about other, less complex parts of speech. Verbs don't understand me!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe you don't understand verbs?
T-Rex: Maybe ADJECTIVES wouldn't force us to have such conversations!
Utahraptor: Okay T-Rex, I'm not sure what's going on here, but without verbs we cannot run or play or smile or even be!
T-Rex: True! But, we can awesome!
T-Rex: And we can sexy!
Utahraptor: We can certainly sexy, that's true!
T-Rex: [large] !
T-Rex: "We can sexy" is totally going to be my epitaph!
T-Rex (punchline): For reals!




T-Rex: Guys, guys!
God: WHAT
T-Rex: Our universe is almost certainly a simulation!
God: SHIIIIIIIIT
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: Because check it out: if you assume that computers will continue to get better, then it stands to reason that one day we'll be able to simulate an entire universe. And then there'll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones! And once you imagine this possibility, what are the odds that OUR universe is the one real one? It's much more likely that all creation is running in the background of some future dude's iPhone 3K!
Utahraptor: Seriously? You're seriously arguing this old idea.
T-Rex: I am, yes!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, think of all the stories in which the characters are running around in a realistic universe, unaware that they're fictional! DUDE! It's overwhelmingly likely that WE'RE in a story right now!
T-Rex: That's stupid.
Utahraptor: That's your theory, stripped of its trendy technology.
God: UTAHRAPTOR HAS A POINT THERE
T-Rex (punchline): noooooooooo




T-Rex: Time to write my latest speculative fiction epic, in which a reality TV star becomes THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNI--
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: --okay nevermind
T-Rex: Instead, I'll write my NEW speculative fiction epic in which a hapless woman, believing she's participating on a prank game show, unwittingly becomes an INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ASSASSI-
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: --okay nevermind that one too. Reality keeps STEALING my ideas!
Utahraptor: That's an easy fix!
Utahraptor: Just make up a story SO OUTRAGEOUS that it could never come true.
T-Rex: Okay! Let's say... after a series of increasingly improbable events, we all realize Earth is actually a SIMULATION, soon to be shut down because it's malfunctioning so badly!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Everyone!! EVERYONE, CALM DOWN! PLEASE! Everyone, PLEASE stop rioting and listen to me!
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex (punchline): I TOTALLY called this




T-Rex: I have the greatest idea for a movie! I've said this before but this time it's for serious. There's this cop, right?
T-Rex: Right!
T-Rex: And he's a "by-the-books" cop who does everything "by the books". But one day a big crime is committed and the only guy who knows anything about it is this criminal: a criminal who is prone to cracking wise! So the cop and the criminal have to team up to stop the bad guys before they commit crimes again. And at the end they have learned to respect each other's way of life, and they hug for a while. Five stars!
Utahraptor: Aw, T-Rex, come on. Why would a "by the books" cop team up with a criminal?
T-Rex: Um, TO SOLVE CRIMES??
Utahraptor: But he's by the books! I don't think there's anything in the "books" about deputizing criminals to go after other criminals. Why wouldn't he just interrogate him to get the information he needs?
T-Rex: ...The movie takes place on a planet where interrogation is banned.
Movie poster: On a PLANET where INTERROGATION is BANNED
Movie poster: One “BY THE BOOKS” COP and one WISE-CRACKING CRIMINAL have to TEAM UP to CATCH OTHER CRIMINALS
Movie poster: they eventually UNDERSTAND each other and HUG
Movie poster (punchline): also the cop is a DINOSAUR we should have put that on the TOP of the POSTER




Narrator: ONE MORNING, A REVELATION:
T-Rex: Having a shower is like admitting you get dirty!
T-Rex: And - and going to the bathroom is like admitting you need to go to the bathroom sometimes! Going to bed is like admitting you get tired! EATING is like admitting you get HUNGRY. Being a cannibal is like admitting you don't throw in with the laws of God and man!
T-Rex: That's it!
Utahraptor: What do you mean, "that's it"?
T-Rex: That's all I got. I've realized that doing things is like admitting to people that you experience the events that cause you to do these things. It's not a very good revelation.
Utahraptor: Well - you tried! You don't have to be a walking revelation factory.
Narrator: LATER!
God: T-REX I'M GOD AND I SAY YOU HAVE TO BE A WALKING REVELATION FACTORY
T-Rex: Utahraptor says I don't!
God (punchline): AWWWWW SHOOT




Narrator: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS BEST
T-Rex: Man. Okay. You have probably made some bad decisions lately if you find yourself in one of these conversations.
T-Rex: But it's not too late!
T-Rex: All you need to know about these conversations is that nobody is right and nobody is ever going to change their mind ever ever, okay? Here's all you need to say: "Ah, yes, that language is good for domain-specific solutions, but it doesn't adequately address the issue of multiple inheritance out of the box."
T-Rex: Just memorize that - phonetically, if necessary - and you'll be good. Observe!
Utahraptor: Ruby on Rails is the best programming language!
T-Rex: Ah, yes!
T-Rex: But that... thing you said, with rails? It's a language for solutions but, um, what addressing issues are there? Like, inheritance of boxes??
Utahraptor: ...That's -
Utahraptor: That's...!
Utahraptor: THAT'S...!!
Off panel: That's not even English; I'm out of here.
T-Rex: And THAT, cats and kittens, is how you win a conversation about programming languages. Now I'm free to eat ice cream sandwiches!
T-Rex (punchline): CAN YOU TRULY SAY THE SAME??




T-Rex: Oh boy, am I ever glad I read the news today! I certainly am happy with all the terrible things happening in the world.
T-Rex: Attention, everyone within the sound of my voice! I was attempting:
T-Rex: SARCASM
Dromiceiomimus: So what bad news did you read, T-Rex? Oil spills? Environmental collapse? Global warming? Ast-
T-Rex: Oh man! Oh crap!! Oh crap crap crap!
T-Rex: I forgot about global warming AGAIN
Utahraptor: Man! Are you going to tell us what you read in the news or not?
T-Rex: Oh, just about octopods!
T-Rex: Just how they're massing in gangs a thousand strong in the Pacific, eating anything in their path, PULLING FISHERMEN OFF THEIR BOATS. Just that sort of thing!!
Utahraptor: Really? That's so sinister.
T-Rex: THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS!
Narrator: LATER, AT HOME:
Off panel: TELL OUR PACIFIC ASSOCIATES WE SAY "HELLO", T-REX.
T-Rex: I - okay? Listen, how did you get into my k-
Off panel: AND ALSO THAT WE SAY "MESSAGE RECEIVED, PLAN OMEGA BLACK PHASE TWO COMMIT"
Off panel (punchline): "GO GO GO"




T-Rex: The only thing that makes sense is this: if you store a body of fresh water for too long, and allow impurities into it, the algae that will grow has a small -
T-Rex: - BUT NONZERO -
T-Rex: chance of becoming sentient. Each algae cell evolves to act like a neuron, and given a big enough container and enough time, they organize. And hey presto: you've got THINKING.
Dromiceiomimus: And I say you're crazy! It's a fully automated AND fully autonomous armoured war machine, able to make its own decisions in battle orders of magnitude faster than any of us POSSIBLY could!
Utahraptor: You're both wrong!
T-Rex: Oh, this should be good.
Utahraptor: I don't get why you're having such trouble here. It clearly refers to a member of a raiding party, typically in an MMORPG, whose job it is to take all the damage, but who also - and this is critical - is able to handle all that damage due to her incredible psionic powers.
T-Rex: Oh, it turns out it's when a bunch of old men sit around agreeing that they DEFINITELY know what the best course of action is.
Narrator: PHRASES THAT SOUND WAY MORE INTERESTING THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE:
Narrator (punchline): TODAY'S WINNER: "THINK TANK"




T-Rex: Yes indeed, I'm old enough that I get to decide where I want to live! And that means I want to live RIGHT HERE.
T-Rex: It's where all my friends pal around!
Dromiceiomimus: Aww, that's very sweet T-Rex, but we'd hate to be the reason you don't go out and explore the world. Don't treat us like an anchor!
T-Rex: I'm not! I'm still going to travel if I want to. But if here is good, why would I move somewhere else where I have to make all NEW friends? I'm initially not the most likeable guy, Dromiceiomimus.
T-Rex: I - I step on stuff
Utahraptor: Man, but now you're an anchor for us!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: We can't move away, because WE'LL feel bad that you stayed because of us and now, we're leaving!
T-Rex: And I wouldn't be able to follow you because that would make ME seem needy and insecure!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: This is a disaster!
T-Rex: Want to never talk about our relationship like this again?
Off panel (punchline): DONE




Sign: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our first letter comes from Pete! It says, "Hey Professor, how can I know when a girl likes me? From Pete."
[no text]
T-Rex: Peteeeeeey has a giiiiiirlfriiiiiend!!
Dromiceiomimus: Petey do you want to smooch on her face? Petey do you want to kiss her on her body??
T-Rex: Petey do you want to hold her hand and tell her how important she is to you?
Dromiceiomimus: PETEY DO YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER WITH HER ON PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES??
Utahraptor: Petey do you want to create the deepest interpersonal connection you've ever experienced with her?
T-Rex: OMG, Petey!
T-Rex: Petey do you want to commit to someone without fear, share yourself without shame, find in yourself the amazing beautiful person you'd always hoped you'd become as she finds it in herself too?
Utahraptor: Petey do you want to wake up in love and go to bed even more in love every day for the rest of your life??
T-Rex: Listen, Petey, do you want to let me know if she has a hot sister??
T-Rex (punchline): This sounds real nice




T-Rex: Where do babies come from?
T-Rex: An excellent course of inquiry!
T-Rex: Solving this mystery will put to rest many of the niggling mysteries of my creation! I will finally have an "origin story"!
Utahraptor: You want to know where babies come from?
T-Rex: I do!
Utahraptor: Are you sure? It's pretty... biological.
T-Rex: Please! Fill me in!
Narrator: SHORTLY...
T-Rex (punchline): MOM did that?




T-Rex: Man, I shouldn't be down about not YET being immortal. There's all sorts of different forms of immortality! Immortality through art, through deed...
T-Rex: ...through ensuring that if I don't live forever, then forever lasts only as long as I do...
Dromiceiomimus: What?! What was that last one again, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Oh! Just idly speculating that if you define immortality as "living for as long as it's possible to live", then if I were somehow responsible for the complete destruction of the universe, I'd EFFECTIVELY be immortal. I'd have lived for as long as it was possible to, until the UNIVERSE ITSELF was lost!
T-Rex: ...You know?
Utahraptor: T-Rex! That's supervillain logic!
T-Rex: I know!! It just sort of - happened!
T-Rex: I awoke this morning - my birthday - and found I'd discovered how to personally benefit from the end of all things. What do you do after that?
Utahraptor: Just because you'll benefit from something doesn't mean you should do it!
T-Rex: Okay but
T-Rex: What if it does though
God: T-REX IF YOU DESTROY THE UNIVERSE I'M GOING TO BE SUPER CHEEZED
T-Rex: With a Z?
God (punchline): WELL HONESTLY I'D BE SO MAD I'M NOT SURE IF I'D TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE IT DOWN




T-Rex: You wake up in a room feeling scared! Oh no, this is a horror story, and there's a scary noise outside your bedroom door!! To investigate the noise, turn to Option 1! To stay in bed, turn to Option 2.
T-Rex: OPTION 1: IT WAS A MONSTER, YOU DIE!
T-Rex: THE END
T-Rex: OPTION 2: You ignore the noise! Guess what, that doesn't matter because it's breaking through the door and killing you anyway! IT WAS A MONSTER, YOU DIE.
T-Rex: THE END
Dromiceiomimus: Pretty short story, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Pretty major form of literature, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but it's instadeath for the player!
T-Rex: It's horror!! What's more horrible than DEATH?
Utahraptor: Easy. "You wake up in a room with a degenerative neural disorder! All that is you is being taken, piece by piece, a little more each day. Sometimes you know how much you've lost. Often you don't. We don't know which is better."
T-Rex: Do I get to make a choice?
Utahraptor: None that matter, T-Rex. Not anymore.
T-Rex (punchline): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH




T-Rex: Let us assume that everyone alive today has two biological parents, a mother and a father. I will call this the "No Cloned Chicks" hypothesis!
T-Rex: And let us further assume that everyone's parents had a biological mother and father too!
T-Rex: This seems pretty reasonable. But it can't possibly be the case! If you take me, I've got two parents. My parents have two parents themselves, so this means that three generations ago, four people are needed to eventually produce me. Another generation back, we're eight people, and five generations ago gives me sixteen ancestors!
Utahraptor: And if you go back a 1500 years or so, say, fifty-five generations?
T-Rex: That's exactly the problem!
T-Rex: At fifty-five generations I've got over TEN QUADRILLION grandparents all running around at the same time! Man! There's NO WAY there was room for that.
Utahraptor: Ah, but you're assuming everyone's sexing up a total genetic stranger. If you sex up a relative, any child produced will have fewer grandparents!
T-Rex: ...Huh! So the fact that there weren't ten quadrillion people 1500 years ago SCIENTIFICALLY PROVES that some of my ancestors liked sexing it up with their cousins!!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): ...Huh.




T-Rex: There are some people who identify not as gay or straight or bisexual or what have you, but rather as asexual. I find this really interesting!
T-Rex: It must be so different!
T-Rex: Some don't find themselves sexually attracted to anyone, while others do, but find all they want in friendship and have no desire to add kissing to the mix.
Dromiceiomimus: And you find this interesting?
T-Rex: I do, because it's so far removed from my own experience. I'm ALL ABOUT adding kissing to the mix! It's what I do best!
Utahraptor: Have you ever met any asexual people, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Nope!
Utahraptor: It's just - I can't get over the feeling that you're treating asexuality like an amusing trinket, rather than a real sexual orientation.
T-Rex: Well - it's a fine line! I'm not asexual myself, so there's a distance between myself and the material. But I am trying.
Narrator: T-REX DECIDES NOT TO KISS ANYONE FOR A MONTH TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE:
T-Rex: I feel - fine! Focused!
T-Rex (punchline): Heck, I probably wasn't going to kiss anyone this month ANYWAY.




T-Rex: Everyone has some problems, right? We all got our own problems. Well.
T-Rex: NOT ANYMORE.
T-Rex: Not if you purchase and then read my new book, "The Dude Without Any Problems! How To Become That Dude By Reading This Book; Also Dude Is Being Used In The Gender-Neutral Sense, So Hello Women, You Too May Buy This Book Please".
Dromiceiomimus: Thanks for including me in your title, T-Rex.
T-Rex: But of course!
Utahraptor: May I get a free sample?
T-Rex: But also of course!
T-Rex: "All problems stem from reality not living up to our hopes and dreams. Either change reality or your hopes and dreams: in other words suck it up, AND/OR, walk it off. THE END."
Utahraptor: Is that... the entire book?
T-Rex: YEP!!
T-Rex: It's short but it costs $200 a copy because I am bad at, like -
T-Rex: - oh, what's it called -
T-Rex (punchline): Um, "BUSINESS"??
