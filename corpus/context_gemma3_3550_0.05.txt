T-Rex: You know what the best part of every movie ever is? Don't say "characters and plot or whatever" because COME ON. The best part of every movie is the HILARIOUS OUTTAKES.
T-Rex: And this sublime satisfaction need no longer be limited to film!
T-Rex: For example, books could have pages like "It is a universal truth that a single man with a large fortune is in need of a life. Hah hah, what did I write? ...'Life?' I meant 'wife'. Okay: new sheet of paper everyone, I promise we're gonna get this. Ready? We're ready? Okay. It is a universal truth that a single man with a large fortune is in need of a wifppppfft - I'm sorry! I got the giggles. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do this."
Utahraptor: That doesn't seem that hilarious, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE.
T-Rex: But music could do it too! For instance, suppose the tubas played the wrong note and then everyone has to go back and start over.
Utahraptor: I think that's already done. I think that's called "rehearsal".
T-Rex: Well it sounds great. Do the tuba players crack up when it happens?
T-Rex: Do they drop their instrument and make a funny face for the audience, then when they play it over do they hit the wrong note really loud and break up laughing again?
Off panel: No, I think they get fired.
T-Rex (punchline): Man! "Reality", am I right??


T-Rex: I am writing the best story ever! In it, I simply APPROPRIATE a popular novel, and then place its author in a generalized version of its premise! THEN, the author has eerily familiar, but thoroughly modernized, adventures.
T-Rex: So, it's like, H.G. Wells actually has a time machine that he uses for wacky escapades!
T-Rex: And then he goes back in time to meet Edgar Allan Poe, who actually IS haunted by the supernatural and has a creepy raven in his study, next to the silken sad uncertain rustling of his purple curtains. After picking up Mary Shelley, they ALL go forward in time and meet Patricia Highsmith, who is surrounded by morally compromised antihero neighbours! Then they all go on a train ride and have an adventure.
Utahraptor: Then what happens?
T-Rex: THEN, my friend, the story writes itself!
T-Rex: And at the end, all the characters high five each other and go home to their own times, promising to write their own versions of what happened. Then, they all write their most famous works!
Utahraptor: Huh!
Narrator: MUCH LATER:
T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe! What are YOU doing here?
Off panel: I'm just chillin' on your couch, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Awesome! I like how you rhyme.


T-Rex: There's a big snowstorm coming tonight. This is so great! By tomorrow morning, everything will be buried under snow, and society will have finally reached its snowmageddon.
T-Rex: It's time to start new civilizations in our living rooms, you guys!
T-Rex: We'll abandon the laws of man as we write new laws, awesome-centric laws that are outside society's precious "morality" and "ideas of what is the right thing to do"!
Dromiceiomimus: Those are the same thing, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, in my NEW civilization, pointing that out will be against the law. That's PROBABLY because my new civilization is a utopia??
Utahraptor: We're only getting a few inches of snow, T-Rex! This is not the end of civilization.
T-Rex: But -
Utahraptor: We have, in fact, invented snowplows precisely to prevent a single storm from doing that.
T-Rex: FINE. Live in reality with your stupid snowplows, and we'll all just forget how amazing a snow-covered world is, and the incredible possibilities the world changing overnight represents.
Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING:
T-Rex: Man, shovelling snow is for chumps! I truly wish I had a snowplow.
T-Rex: That's right, ladies!
T-Rex (punchline): I'M wildly inconsistent in what I want!!


T-Rex: The number of hamburgers in my body is probably around 3. That's a 'thr' followed by two 'e's!
T-Rex: Guys!
T-Rex: That's an acceptable amount of friggin' burgers!
T-Rex: But to compare, the number of burgers in the universe is EVEN MORE. Let's lowball it and say it's at least a million right now: that's one followed by six zeroes! And that means that the percentage of the burgers in the universe right now that are INSIDE ME is... zero point
Dromiceiomimus: zero
T-Rex: zero
Utahraptor: zero
T-Rex: three!
Utahraptor: Are we sure there's a million burgers on the planet? That seems a little high.
T-Rex: Really? I thought it was low. People put hamburgers in warehouses, right? Burger warehouses?
Utahraptor: I guess?
T-Rex: ...anyway, this leads us nicely into my new business card slogan:
T-Rex: HELLO! I ATE THREE BURGERS TODAY!
T-Rex (punchline): "IT'S A START"


T-Rex: People are sad sometimes, and that makes me very sad. Therefore, I will dedicate my memorable "problem solving skills" towards solving the problem of sadness once and for all!
Narrator: WAYS TO BE HAPPY
T-Rex: Way to be happy #1: amnesia! Forget your problems!
T-Rex: This has the problem of robbing you of your present, history, and self, however. Most people like those things! So Method #2 is using happiness-inducing DRUGS and ALCOHOL.
Dromiceiomimus: That seems to have many of the same limitations as Method #1!
T-Rex: TRUE. But I have other methods! Method #3 is having a rewarding and satisfying professional and personal life. Tada!
Utahraptor: But that's more a definition of happiness than a guide to achieving it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: OKAY.
T-Rex: Luckily, I still have Method #4, which is to set unreasonably low expectations for everyone, including yourself.
Utahraptor: THAT only works if you're euphoric whenever expectations are met.
T-Rex: MAN! EVERYONE is making it really hard for me to solve the eternal problem of unhappiness!
Narrator: BUT THEN, INSPIRATION! A PERFECT SOLUTION FOR ENDLESS JOY!
T-Rex: W-...
T-Rex (punchline): Wildly misinterpret your own despair?


Narrator: TIPS FOR JOB HUNTERS
T-Rex: Attention, people who are hunting jobs! You are known as "job hunters" and guess what? I have some tips for you, my friends!
T-Rex: Tip number one is to have a good email address!
T-Rex: If I were an employer and I had two equally qualified candidates, but one resume came from colin@businesssuccessislifesuccess.com and the other resume came from colin@chumpstakingdumps.com, I know which one I'd want to hire!
Dromiceiomimus: Is it colin@chumpstakingdumps.com?
T-Rex: It is without hesitation!
T-Rex: That business success jerk has the most obnoxious email address ever.
Utahraptor: And the other guy doesn't?
T-Rex: No man! The other guy surveyed the field of resume email addresses and said, "You know what? It can be done better." I'm fascinated by him! Who is this Colin? And furthermore, what of his Chumps, who it seems are presently Taking Dumps?? I don't know, but I want to offer him a job to find out!
Narrator: T-REX PUTS UP A FAKE JOB LISTING TO SEE WHAT EMAIL ADDRESSES HE GETS. THE BEST IS FROM COLIN@BONERSAPOPPIN.NET
T-Rex: Hah hah! Awesome!
T-Rex (punchline): ...It's not the guy I made up, though.


T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a young woman called Little Red Riding Hood! Her parents, who were grown adults, named her after the clothes they bought for her.
Narrator: THE STORY OF LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
Narrator: as told in the 14th century
T-Rex: Red is on her way to visit her grandmother, who lives in the woods. She meets a wolf and tells him where she's going, so Wolf gets there before her and murders the grandmother. Then he DRESSES UP IN HER CLOTHES while BOTTLING HER BLOOD AND CHOPPING UP HER FLESH. Then he gets into her bed.
T-Rex: I - I don't know why.
T-Rex: This is a story for children, I dunno
Utahraptor: And then Red shows up?
T-Rex: That's still the same, yeah!
T-Rex: Only now Wolf tells Red to eat, so she unknowingly CANNIBALIZES HER OWN GRANDMOTHER. Then either Wolf eats Red, THE END, or convinces her to burn her clothes (WHAT) and get into bed with her "grandmother" (WHAT) at which point Red saves herself by saying she needs to poo and doesn't want to poo the bed (WHATTTT)
T-Rex: Red runs back to home naked and has learnt a valuable lesson: don't talk to strangers!
T-Rex (punchline): She later reflects, wistfully, that the lesson could've easily been conveyed without murder, cannibalism and zoophilia, but OH WELL!


T-Rex: Aw geez. Okay.
T-Rex: The sender of this card is REALLY SORRY.
Narrator: I HEARD YOU HAVING SEX LAST NIGHT
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: The sender of this card wants you to know they couldn't help listening in. The sound was, like - everywhere. And the sender of this card is still thinking about it the next day, enough to send you this web card. But let's not make things "weird", okay? Let's ALL just get past this.
Dromiceiomimus: Wouldn't the very act of sending this card make things weird?
T-Rex: IMPOSSIBLE
Utahraptor: Yeah, the rules are that you pretend you didn't hear! Then you NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.
T-Rex: Maybe it keeps happening !
T-Rex: Maybe the sender of this card knows every time it happens because it's like a radio broadcast they can't turn off, only the radio is broadcasting moans and groans and "I'm sorry"s and "Bombs away!"s.
Utahraptor: ...
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR I COULD HEAR IT AND I WASN'T EVEN IN THE SAME HOUSE AS THE SENDER OF THIS CARD
T-Rex: Anyway, dear loud sexin' recipient of this card! LIKE, EVERYONE HEARD YOU
T-Rex (punchline): ...Not sure what else there is to say really, check yourself before you wreck yourself


T-Rex: This one scientist estimated that we can only manage about 150 stable relationships at the same time! Any more than that and we lose the plot. Or so claims Mr. Dunbar, who came up with this and called it "Dunbar's Number", because of course he did!
T-Rex: But I, T-Rex, have my own number to add to this!
T-Rex: If we can only keep track of 150 people in relationships with people who know us, there must also similarly be a ceiling on the number of ONE-WAY relationships: T-Rex's number! It's the number of CELEBRITIES that we can keep track of. Like Dunbar, I estimate that number is also around oh let's say 150!
T-Rex: And this implies an actionable result!
Utahraptor: Which is?
T-Rex: Which IS, if the average person can only care about 150 celebs, if YOU want to become famous, it's a VIABLE STRATEGY to engineer the disgrace of another EXISTING celebrity. This frees open a slot in people's minds you can take!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, don't -
T-Rex: TOO LATE!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: So in summary, Thomas Jeffrey Hanks, all I'm asking is that if you ever decide to retire, instead you do something bad and then tell everyone to follow ME instead!
Off panel: No.
T-Rex (punchline): TOM YOU'VE BEEN FAMOUS FOR DECADES, COME ON, BE COOL


T-Rex: I'm not a dude who usually has dreams, but last night I dreamed I had a whole other house, had forgotten about paying the mortgage, and was now horribly in debt?
T-Rex: Thanks, subconscious!
T-Rex: Not only did I get to have FABRICATED MONEY WOES, but I also got to wake up with the same dream-feeling of "aw snap, I'm in trouble now" in real life too. Woo!
Dromiceiomimus: And this coloured your emotions in the morning, and whatever you thought of seemed to be a little worse because of it? I've had that too!
T-Rex: Exactly. Sucks to that!
Utahraptor: Maybe it's the whole butterfly dreaming he's a dinosaur thing, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Perhaps literally!!
T-Rex: Maybe I really have made tons of mistakes in my real life (as a butterfly) and then I go to sleep and dream I'm this awesome dinosaur with friends! Then I wake up and I'm still this indebted SUCKY BUTTERFLY with bad fiscal management skills.
Utahraptor: Aww! You're cuter as a butterfly.
T-Rex: Man, I'm a butterfly saddled with crippling debt! There's nothing cute about that.
Off panel: There is if you imagine the debt in tiny butterfly dollars, each colourfully illustrated with even tinier butterflies and flowers.
T-Rex (punchline): Granted!!


T-Rex: Two months ago I noticed I had a small case of the chubbs! So I decided to lose some weight, and THEN, I lost the weight. I just ate fewer foods?
T-Rex: Guys, this is terrible!
T-Rex: Nobody who's trying to lose weight wants to hear from the guy who shed pounds like they were a Hallowe'en costume... in July, or something. That is to say, "quickly"?
T-Rex: The point is that dieting is about commiserating, and I'm the guy who shows up to the party saying "guys, it's not hard" and that my secret to weight-loss success is "um, eating less."
Utahraptor: Maybe you can present it in a more positive way?
T-Rex: How?
Utahraptor: Well, instead of saying "I just ate less", why not say "While portion control remains the most important part of weight loss, healthier choices and an active lifestyle all contribute towards positive change in our lives"?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm your friend and even I hate you a little just from that sentence.
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: Hey, T-Rex, looking good! Have you lost weight?
T-Rex: Yeah! It took a whole lot of diet plans, and... and breakfast... shakes?
Off panel (punchline): NICE.


T-Rex: The Problem with Wikipedia is that it's peppered with vandalism at various times and at various locations: vandalism that remains until it's noticed by someone who knows enough and cares enough to fix it! SOMETIMES THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE. But!
T-Rex: [small] *ahem*
T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: I have solved the Wikipedia Problem!
T-Rex: The solution is as brilliant as it is awesome: instead of vandalizing the ENTIRE encyclopedia, we all just agree to vandalize one article, leaving the other ones alone! That article is the one about chickens. Why? It's pretty obvious. DUDES ALREADY KNOW ABOUT CHICKENS.
T-Rex: In conceding that one TINY article to the vandals, Wikipedia wins! Their victory: a FULLY ACCURATE encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe, 'cept chickens.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is worse than taking on the mob! Wikipedia will be HELLUVA mad at you!
T-Rex: No way! I am doing them a FAVOUR.
T-Rex: Their vandalism problem GOES AWAY, FOREVER, and all that I ask is that chickens become The Forbidden Topic. "We never talk about chickens", they can say. "DON'T ASK."
Utahraptor: But how are you going to get people to respect this idea? Plus, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT MANY WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE TRULY HUMOURLESS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA??
T-Rex: I guess we're about to find out! I bet Fictional Jimbo Wales loves the idea.
Off panel: I do love this idea, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Fictional Jimbo Wales! You brought cupcakes!!


T-Rex: There's nothing wrong with a new language being a simple variant of English! Heck, modern French is just a riff on middle Swedish!
T-Rex: Or so I assume, having never looked into the matter with any seriousness!!
T-Rex: So I'm just going to focus on IMPROVEMENTS, and the first improvement I'm making on English is adding the amazing EXCLUSIVE WE.
Dromiceiomimus: Ah, yes! While our "we" means "you and I", other languages also have a "we" that means "everyone here EXCEPT YOU, THE PERSON I'M TALKING TO. OH SNAP."
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus
T-Rex: If you knew about it all this time why did you keep it a big secret
T-Rex: Anyway, my other improvement is adding an exclusive "you"!
Utahraptor: How does that work?
T-Rex: It's a "you" that basically means "anyone but you". So I can say "[Exclusive] We are going to a party! [Anyone but] You should really come!"
Utahraptor: Man, how would you feel if someone said that to you?
T-Rex: Um, STOKED THAT MY LANGUAGE HAS CAUGHT ON??
T-Rex (punchline): AND THEN SAD, OBVIOUSLY??


T-Rex: I went to the optometrist AGAIN last night, and AGAIN she said I might need to get nerd goggles!
T-Rex: (She called them "glasses" but you can tell she was thinking "nerd goggles"!)
T-Rex: The PROBLEM is that I define myself in terms of not having glasses! People are always "Oh, you're looking for T-Rex? He's the green tyrannosaurus rex over there! You'll be able to spot him because he's so not wearing glasses."
Dromiceiomimus: Aw, I think you'd look cute in them! I also think you can turn this around and make glasses your thing, you know?
Narrator: SHORTLY THEREAFTER.
T-Rex: Maybe Dromiceiomimus is right!
Utahraptor: She usually is!
T-Rex: I COULD get some pretty kick-ass glasses. Like glasses that say "WARNING: AWESOME DUDE" on them! OOH, or horn-rimmed 60s housewife glasses! Sweetness!
Utahraptor: You'll have to wear them every day, so maybe you'll, um, want to see how they look before you commit?
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER:
T-Rex: I'm here to pick up my prescription "Happy New Year 2004" glasses! They have a plastic "2" on one side and a "4" on the other.
Off panel: Sir, you have made an unforgettable choice.
T-Rex (punchline): I like you too, optometrist clerk!


T-Rex: What happens tomorrow is based on what happens today.
T-Rex: Guys!
T-Rex: I can make tomorrow totally awesome!
T-Rex: I just have to be slightly less awesome today!
T-Rex: Awesomeness builds on itself. If I build a robot suit today, that's pretty awesome, but if tomorrow I change it so it can hold a sign that says "HEY GUYS LOOK WHAT I DID INSTEAD OF CHECKING MY EMAIL", that's even more awesome.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, so be awesome today! Build that robot suit!
T-Rex: Well I WOULD, except I TOTALLY DON'T KNOW HOW.
Utahraptor: So start learning about robot suits. Baby steps!
T-Rex: Again: totally would if I totally could!
T-Rex: But robot suits are years off; it's not like I can just download a technical manual.
Utahraptor: So work on solving some of the problems that are between us and fully functional robot suits!
T-Rex: That WOULD pay off in intense awesomeness down the road! Okay. I'll do it!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear mathematicians, engineers, and neuro-silicon biolink dudes! Um, this stuff is way over my head. THE FUTURE WE ALL WANT IS WAITING FOR YOU TO KNOCK THIS ONE OUT OF THE PARK. Do it before I die, okay?
T-Rex (punchline): That's a deal, okay?


Narrator: IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE RECALL AFFECTING YOUR BODY
T-Rex: Hello! You are reading this message because you have been a patron of our "Physical Body Made of Meat" product in the past several million years.
T-Rex: We regret to inform you that an issue has been discovered with your body!
T-Rex: Besides the known issues of Bug 24442 ("aging"), Bug 59804 ("body gets smelly if I use it"), and Bug 2 ("poop comes out the butt?!"), a new vulnerability has been discovered with the "heart" hardware installed in your body. Known as "commotio cordis", it's a 30 millisecond long window during each heartbeat wherein an impact to your chest could, um... stop your heart and kill you instantly.
T-Rex: WHOOPS
Utahraptor: Is every single heartbeat vulnerable for instadeath?
T-Rex: Yes.
Utahraptor: I see. Can I return my body for a new one?
T-Rex: No, this isn't that kind of recall. This is more the, "you should RECALL this crazy vulnerability whenever something comes close to your chest" sort of thing. Okay bye!
T-Rex: Enjoy your bod!
Narrator: OH! ONE MORE THING ABOUT BODIES:
T-Rex: Um, sorry we didn't build them better??
Narrator (punchline): THE END


God: T-REX DID YOU HEAR ARCHIE IS GETTING MARRIED
T-Rex: Perennial teen Archie Andrews of Riverdale, USA?! To whom?
God: VERONICA LODGE
T-Rex: Oh, poor Veronica!
Dromiceiomimus: You'd rather she marry - well, who, Jughead?
T-Rex: Man, I'd rather she expand her horizons beyond the ten NON-BACKGROUND characters in Riverdale. Her dating options there are, in their entirety: Archie, Moose, Dilton, Chuck, Reggie, and Jughead. That's it! PROBABLY SHE CAN DO BETTER. Maybe she should chat up Background Teen In Green Shirt once in a while, you know?
Utahraptor: That's like complaining when Princess Leia falls for Han Solo!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: And that is a valid complaint! I hate it when fictional universes are SO CLAUSTROPHOBIC that everyone's hanging out in the same swimming pool.
Utahraptor: Huh?
T-Rex: Okay that's a metaphor, but just BARELY. It's basically a literal description of what's going on.
T-Rex: Only so many characters can splash around in a swimming pool at the same time. And they keep bumping into each other!
T-Rex (punchline): Man! If there's a better two-sentence summary of BOTH Star Wars and Archie comics, I don't want to hear it!


God: T-REX TODAY IS THE DAY FOR TOTAL EMOTIONAL HONESTY
T-Rex: Nopers!!
T-Rex: TODAY is the day of continuing to leave certain emotions unstated AND/OR ignored!
T-Rex: This is because total honesty has the power to DESTROY relationships! FOR EXAMPLE, Dromiceiomimus, if we're in a committed monogamous relationship, I don't want my friend or even a random dude coming up to you and saying how he loves you more than anything and how he could never admit it until now! I want him to suffer in silence. For the greater good!
Dromiceiomimus: Is he hot?
Utahraptor: You're privileging your happiness over his!
T-Rex: No! I'm just looking at TOTAL happiness.
T-Rex: My girlfriend and I are in love, and my friend and I are happy. This equals 15 happiness points, 10 for love and 5 for friendship.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: But if he confesses love to her, I'm now UNhappy with my friend, and we're down 5 HP! Forget THAT noise.
Off panel: I think you're just setting up this point system so that it supports you and your lady friend staying together!
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRLFRIEND
T-Rex: WHEN I GET ONE
T-Rex (punchline): HER NAME WILL BE "SAMANTHA"; IT IS A PRETTY NAME


T-Rex: Antonio Tony and Amelia, my erotic fiction characters, go to sleep after having some erotic fiction! While they sleep, Antonio dreams he's chatting Amelia up! Sheesh! Give her a rest, Antonio!
T-Rex: But then they wake up and discover THEY BOTH DREAMED THE SAME CHATS UP!
T-Rex: THIS WAS HOW IT BEGAN. Soon the whole world discovers that dreams have become consistent across everyone - as near as we can tell, even our DOGS are entering the same shared dreamspace! Communication becomes free, as long as both of you are sleeping, and the world changes, literally overnight.
Utahraptor: And since communication is free, spammers are soon running around yelling about their boner pills!
T-Rex: What?! No!
Utahraptor: Sleep becomes a hellish 8 hours, per night, of inescapable advertisement.
T-Rex: But since it's dreams, we can kill all the spammers we want without consequence! Then they wake up saying "Man I suck bad" or whatever it is spammers say when they look in the mirror at 3 in the morning.
Off panel: Then the spammers weaponize too, and suddenly it's an all-out worldwide war for our dreams, where the only limit is... OUR IMAGINATION.
T-Rex: Yes!! YES, let's make this happen!
T-Rex (punchline): PLEASE SANTA MAKE MY EROTIC FICTION REAL


T-Rex: When you break up with someone, can you still be friends?
T-Rex: Sources say, "Yep! SURE CAN!"
T-Rex: I think it's a good idea because you loved them, right? I don't see that changing just because you broke up. They still must be pretty great!
Dromiceiomimus: But - what if you broke up with them because you didn't love them anymore?
T-Rex: OKAY. But there still must be things that attracted you to them, and you can still have those as friends! Maybe they're really good at karaoke, or adept at shoe repair. That's attractive!
Utahraptor: That IS attractive!
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying!
Utahraptor: But I think you're ignoring the possibility that even just seeing this person could be too painful, shoe repair aside. That happens pretty often!
T-Rex: OKAY HONESTLY I did not expect this to be this complicated. All my breakups have been clean AND totally awesome!
Narrator: THE PAST BREAKUP CAM:
[vertical motion lines above T-Rex]
T-Rex: We jumped out of an orbital tower and are now freefalling from outer space onto giant trampolines!
Off panel: I know! I think we should see other people, baby!
T-Rex (punchline): That's cool!
