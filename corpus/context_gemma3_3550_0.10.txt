T-Rex: As a gentleman who is not afraid to say what we're all thinking, I'm going to say what we're all thinking.
T-Rex: Guys! We totally need a new analogy for sex!
T-Rex: The one we have now is BROKEN. Sex as hunger? Okay, it works with "sexual appetite" and it works in that you want sex, and then you have sex, and then you're like, man, that's all the sex *I* can handle, and then in a little while you start to get the munchies for sex again. But that's it!
Utahraptor: Sounds like a good analogy to me!
T-Rex: But it's totally not!
T-Rex: I can die if I don't get any food, but if I don't get any sex, then I just - keep on keepin' on? Also if I'm hungry, I can't lock myself in a room and satisfy my hunger with my own food that's BASICALLY almost as good as the genuine item.
Utahraptor: Food that you - produce yourself?
Off panel: Food that the Catholic church really doesn't want you to - eat?
T-Rex: Hah hah, ewwwww! Gross!!
T-Rex (punchline): Seriously though, there are problems with the analogy.


T-Rex: Gentlemen and gentlewomen, thank you for joining me today. As I said in my letter that drew you here, I have an exciting proposition to put to each of you: I propose we undertake a voyage!
T-Rex: I propose we undertake a voyage to no lesser target than the south pole!!
Dromiceiomimus: Are you serious, T-Rex? Because I'd love to go, but it's super expensive: cruises cost like 10 thousand dollars, plus there's the effects tourism can have on a place, distorting local culture and in some cases the original beauty that first drew people ther-
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: There'll be PENGUINS
Utahraptor: If you really want to go, maybe you'd like to know the history of the place first?
T-Rex: Please!
Narrator: OKAY, THIS IS ME NARRATING NOW, T-REX. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CAPTAIN ROBERT SCOTT. YOU'LL BE SCOTT.
T-Rex: I'm an ambitious military officer, but it's hard to get noticed for a promotion!
Utahraptor: Why not captain a trip to the Antarctic?
T-Rex: Dang, I should TOTES do that!
Narrator: REMEMBER: YOU'RE IN VICTORIAN TIMES.
T-Rex: Forsooth, I verily doth wantus that!!
Narrator: HISTORY FOR YOU IS A BIG PARTY WHERE EVERYONE JUST HANGS OUT TOGETHER, ISN'T IT?
T-Rex: F-
T-Rex (punchline): Forsooth


T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a grasshopper who spent all summer singing and an ant who spent the summer storing food for winter! Then winter arrived and the grasshopper found herself starving.
Narrator: THE FABLE OF THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER
T-Rex: That's uh - that's actually the whole thing. Grasshopper starves and begs Ant for food, but he, through a mouthful of food, tells Grasshopper to dance her hunger away instead. Grasshopper starves to death, THE END, I HOPE YOU ENJOYED STORYTIME??
Dromiceiomimus: Grasshopper doesn't starve necessarily! It's possible Ant gave her some food as payment because he found her dancing amusing. LIKE IN CAPITALISM??
Utahraptor: Yeah, maybe G-Hops represents a career in the arts!
T-Rex: And Ant a career in financial services?
Utahraptor: YES. It shows us how those who are way loaded have a moral duty to support artists, because otherwise they'll die due to their life choices.
T-Rex: But Grasshopper's a singer! Ant likes dancing, but she might not even know how to do that!!
Utahraptor: Well if she likes food she'd better learn fast!
Narrator: THE END
Narrator (punchline): P.S.: FABLES ARE TERRIBLE


T-Rex: My last attempt to be a motivational speaker didn't go so well. But this time I have a plan: GENERATIVE ADVICE. For example!
T-Rex: "Customers know what they want, but they want what they know!"
Dromiceiomimus: Wow, that actually sounds like good business advice, T-Rex. Customers want to buy something they're already familiar with!
T-Rex: I know, right? But I totally just made it up, according to my Generative Advice Formula. And I have tons more! Like, for a restaurant: "Customers eat what they see, but they see what they eat."
Dromiceiomimus: That one is less impressive.
T-Rex: Maybe because it follows the first one?
Utahraptor: Your advice formula is "Customers VERB1 what they VERB2, but they VERB2 what they VERB1", for all transitive verbs, right?
T-Rex: Okay YEAH it's obvious, but it works! And it can be customized to any environment. Self-help? "Do what you want, but want what you do". Writers? "Write what you know, but know what you write."
Utahraptor: Oh yeah? What about colonists?
T-Rex: "Colonize what you explore, but explore what you colonize."
Off panel: Zookeepers!
T-Rex: "Tame what you keep, but please, keep what you tame."
Off panel: Nurses?
T-Rex: "Nurses take care of the injured, but they injure who they take care of."
T-Rex (punchline): Okay, whatever! My formula is still good DESPITE nurse racism.


Narrator: [dark red] the DINOSAUR at the end of this comic
Narrator: [dark blue] starring lovable, scaly old [green] T-REX
T-Rex: Hello, everybodee!
T-Rex: This is a very dull panel. What is on the next panel?
T-Rex: [red] WHAT DID THAT SAY? [end red] Did that say there will be a dinosaur at the end of this comic?
T-Rex: It did? Oh, I am so scared of dinosaurs!!
T-Rex: Listen, I have an idea. If you do not read [dark red]any panels[end dark red], we will never get to the end of this comic.
T-Rex: And that is good, because there is a [dark red] dinosaur [end dark red] at the end of this comic.
T-Rex: [small] so please do not read the next panel.
Utahraptor: [dark red] THEY READ THE PANEL!
T-Rex: Maybe you do not understand! You do not know what you are [dark red] doing [end dark red] to me!
T-Rex: I, T-Rex, am [dark red] begging [end dark red] you not to read the next panel!
Utahraptor: The next panel is the [underline] end [end underline] of this comic, and there is a [dark red] DINOSAUR [end dark red] at the end of this comic!
T-Rex: ['SCARED' is dark red, all 'PLEASE' are dark blue] Oh, I am so  [dark red] SCARED!  [end dark red] Please do not read the next panel. [dark blue] PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!
T-Rex: Well, look at that! This is the end of the comic, and the only one here is [dark blue] ME!
T-Rex: I, lovable, scaly old [green] T-Rex [end green] am the dinosaur at the end of this comic!
T-Rex (punchline): And you were so scared! I [underline] told [end underline] you and [underline] told [end underline] you there was nothing to be afraid of!


Narrator: T-REX IN: "FLOWERS IN RELATIONSHIPS"
T-Rex: I am against giving your sweetie flowers when you are in a relationship. Oh God! Think of the symbolism!
T-Rex: The horrible symbolism!
Dromiceiomimus: What symbolism? They just show that you care!
T-Rex: No way! They represent AFFECTION, right? They represent your love. But they die in like a week, no matter what you do! I don't need no punkass flowers reminding me that everything beautiful dies sooner than I want to believe.
Utahraptor: So what do you do when you want to give a loved one a present that is alive?
T-Rex: I buy POTTED PLANTS.
T-Rex: They're still in the ground, so they last for years! Tada!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but they'll still die eventually! All that's changed is that NOW your sweetie has to care for the plants until then, as they represent your relationship in much the same way the flowers did!
T-Rex: True! However, the plants now ALSO serve as a constant reminder of me and how I need water (viz., smooches)!
T-Rex (punchline): I am writing a book called "Relentless Reminders of Physical Neediness: Maybe She'll Like You Now?"


T-Rex: My hard-core vegetarian friend has decided to start eating meat for six months!!
T-Rex: It's because of her low iron levels, but that's not important right now!
T-Rex: She hasn't had meat her entire adult life and now she doesn't know how to cook it or what to buy or what's good or anything! She's a babe in the FLESHY WOODS, and wants someone to guide her through the WONDERFUL WORLD OF MEAT.
Dromiceiomimus: Oh my god. It's the job you were born to do.
T-Rex: I KNOW; I'M SO EXCITED!!
Utahraptor: So where are you gonna start?
T-Rex: I can't decide!
T-Rex: Do we stick with bland dishes, like tofu-style boiled chicken breast? Do we dive into the deep end of the meat pool and serve up a charcuterie platter of brains and organmeats?? DO I DARE SHARE THE SUBLIME BRILLIANCE OF BONE MARROW, KNOWING IT WILL FOREVER CHANGE HER LIFE??
Flier: [with an arrow pointing at a picture of T-Rex] HELLO IT'S ME, YOUR FRIEND T-REX
Flier: [red] I heard you want to start eating MEAT. I want to help you feast on the Lesser Animals
Flier: [blue] I will teach you how to prepare their Skin and which of their Muscles to Chew
Flier: [pink] Did you know that you can even Swallow the insides of their Bones??
Flier: [gold] **I will show you how to soak their Bodies in SAUCES**
Flier (punchline): I will watch you Eat and then Join In


God: T-REX IF YOU WERE TO DIE SOON
God: LIKE SAY
God: TOMORROW
God: WHAT WOULD THERE BE ON YOUR BUCKET LIST
T-Rex: Top of my bucket list is to die without ever using the phrase "bucket list", so thanks for ruining that one for me. But next would be to get thrown out of a place!
Dromiceiomimus: It's not hard to get kicked out of somewhere, T-Rex!
T-Rex: No. No, I said THROWN out.
Utahraptor: Like in cartoons? Held up by your belt and shirt collar?
T-Rex: EXACTLY.
T-Rex: And then I land in a pile of trash with a banana peel on my head. And I exhale, and the banana peel over my face lifts up a bit. Then it flops down again.
Utahraptor: Wow.
T-Rex: I know! Doesn't that sound nice?
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: I think that sounds real nice.
T-Rex: Some men climb mountains, while others split atoms like the gods themselves. All I want to do is get a shopkeep with strong upper body strength to object to my continued presence.
Off panel: And yet you haven't even done that yet.
T-Rex (punchline): AW MAN, WHAT THE HELL


T-Rex: I may have been too hard on evolution the other day. The fact that plants have photosynthesis IS pretty awesome!
T-Rex: We're surrounded by living creatures that EAT SUN.
T-Rex: And then I realized: any animal I eat either eats plants or eats another animal! Thus does cruel mistress Induction decree that this entire chain is based on plants, and so even when I'm eating meatburgers I'm eating SUN, the only way I know how: INDIRECTLY.
Dromiceiomimus: You actually do a form of photosynthesis yourself, T-Rex!
T-Rex: GET the heck OUT.
Utahraptor: It's true! It's not photosynthesis like plants do, but sun does react with your skin to synthesize vitamin D.
T-Rex: What?!
T-Rex: So what you're saying is I - have superpowers?
Utahraptor: Well, the same superpower every other vertebrate has.
T-Rex: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS I HAVE SUPERPOWERS.
Utahraptor: Ones that are more useful against rickets than crime, yes.

Narrator: AT THE RECEPTION:
T-Rex: Well, the wedding went off without a hitch!
T-Rex: Ha ha, not counting the slang meaning of 'hitch' of course!
T-Rex: What did you think of the wedding, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: I promised myself I wouldn't cry, but I cried! It was a beautiful wedding. Are you going to see the brides?
T-Rex: I'm on my way there now!
T-Rex: I will congratulate them on finding happiness!
Utahraptor: What are you talking about?
Utahraptor: The brides are gone, T-Rex! Remember when they ran down the church stairs while we showered confetti on them? They've left for their honeymoon!
T-Rex: Oh yeah! But there's still cake for us, right?
Utahraptor: Right!
T-Rex (punchline): I love lesbian weddings!


T-Rex: Once upon a time, Jack came into possession of some strange beans, which when planted caused a giant beanstalk to suddenly and dramatically grow up into the clouds. Were there giants up there? He was eager to find out!
Narrator: JACK AND THE BEANSTALK
Narrator: a peer-reviewed fairy tale
T-Rex: Jack climbed up the beanstalk, but had to turn back once it started to get cold. He tried again the next day, but began getting dizzy once he reached a certain height - the air was too thin, and he'd need an oxygen supply if he were to go any further. He wasn't close to cloud level either, so there was still a long way to go.
Utahraptor: So he got an oxygen pack and went to meet the giant?
T-Rex: Well, he planned to!
T-Rex: However this took a few days, during which the tremendous pressure this giant beanstalk put on local soils became evident. It had exhausted them of both nutrients and moisture, causing all crops to fail, and starvation followed. Soon even the beanstalk itself turned to a brown, rotted husk.
T-Rex: Before he died, Jack said "I do not understand how such a plant could evolve, let alone reproduce in such a manner, especially since the square-cube law would seem to preclude a plant growing in the way we've observed."
Narrator (punchline): THE END


T-Rex: 60 years ago we thought we'd have flying cars. 40 years ago, we at least thought we'd have a human level AI. 20 years ago, we thought we'd be surfing the information superhighway in VR and accidentally downloading viruses into our brains.
T-Rex: ALL WRONG! What if the future isn't predictable at all?
T-Rex: What if the sum total of all activity on this planet is SO COMPLICATED and SO COMPLEX that it simply can't be measured, let alone predicted? What if, rather than marching into a bright tomorrow that we can all see on the horizon, we're instead stumbling towards a dark unknown, and any landmarks we THINK we see up ahead are wishful thinking at best and mirages at worst?
Utahraptor: Well that's pretty bleak, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It sure is!
Utahraptor: And pretty defeatist. I can still predict what you'll do at the individual level, so the future isn't ENTIRELY unknown.
T-Rex: Come on, I'm not THAT predictable!
Utahraptor: Yes you are!
T-Rex: No I'm not!!
Off panel: T. Rex, this is me unfolding a piece of paper on which I've written the words "T-Rex is going to say 'no I'm not.'"
T-Rex: Wow!
T-Rex (punchline): My friend, you have narrated that action, which I can see perfectly but which would be invisible if things were framed just so, PERFECTLY


God: HEY T-REX YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY THE UNIVERSE COULD END
T-Rex: You wake up and it was all a crazy dream?? You know what ALL OF CREATION would say if that happened?
T-Rex: "Weaaaaaaaaak"
God: NO I AM TALKING ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE SPEEDING UP UNTIL ALL STRUCTURES BEGIN TO TEAR THEMSELVES APART
T-Rex: What?
God: YEAH IF DARK ENERGY HAS ENOUGH REPULSIVE POWER TO CONTINUOUSLY INCREASE THE EXPANSION RATE OF THE UNIVERSE EVENTUALLY GALAXIES WILL BE TORN APART THEN PLANETS AND THEN ATOMS THEMSELVES
God: SHOULD BE
God: UH
God: PRETTY NEAT
T-Rex: Pretty neat?
T-Rex: Pretty NEAT!?
Utahraptor: What's pretty neat?
T-Rex: God, WHO I USED TO THINK WAS KINDA COOL, is talking about everything being eventually torn apart by accelerating Universal expansion!
Utahraptor: Ah, the "big rip" theory. Yeah, it's a newer one but pretty interesting to consider. We've still got over 20 BILLION years before it'll happen though!
Narrator: 21 BILLION YEARS LATER:
God: I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS T-REX I WAS WRONG AND THE BIG RIP DIDN'T HAPPEN
God: OH WAIT THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF T-REX AND THE EARTH IS LONG SINCE DUST
God (punchline): DAAAAAAANG


T-Rex: So light behaves like both a particle and a wave, right? And I can hit dudes with particles. Is there nothing stopping me from making a light cannon, which, when fired, throws dudes up against the wall?
T-Rex: Weaponized photons!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex - photons don't have any mass, do they? If they had mass, wouldn't that mean that walking outside on a sunny day would mean being hit with trillions of tiny bullets, reducing everything to a red, pulpy, well-lit paste?
T-Rex: But then how do solar sails work? And photon engines? Don't they work by photons pushing against things? HAS SCIENCE FICTION BEEN LYING THROUGH ITS SCIENCE TEETH??
Utahraptor: Maybe even without mass, photons can still exert pressure!
T-Rex: Perhaps!!
T-Rex: And if solar sails work, THEN SO TOO WILL MY LIGHT CANNON! I'll just need tons of light.
Utahraptor: I think you'd need more than the entire output of the sun!
T-Rex: THAT, my friend, would be a pretty sweet cannon slash flashlight. Quick! To Professor Science's house!
Narrator: SOON:
Off panel: I don't think he's home.
T-Rex: Sure he is. PROFESSOR SCIENCE! IT'S T-REX, UTAHRAPTOR AND DROMICEIOMIMUS!
T-Rex (punchline): We brought LABCOATS!


T-Rex: Last night I built myself a machine...
T-Rex: ... a time machine!
T-Rex: This time machine is a watch, one that allows me to travel through time at the fantastic rate of one second per second!
T-Rex: It will show me what tomorrow is like, tomorrow!
T-Rex: (What a great adventure!)
Utahraptor: That sounds like a pretty useless time machine!
T-Rex: Hey!
Utahraptor: Besides, everybody knows that the smart way to build a time machine is to spend your life building it, but then have your future self send it back in time to you right now, thereby saving you the effort! You've been wasting your time!
T-Rex: What?
Narrator: SUDDENLY, THIS COMIC'S PUNCHLINE, AND THAT OF THE SYNDICATED COMIC STRIP "CATHY", ARE SWITCHED!
T-Rex (punchline): Ack!


Narrator: IT WAS ALL A DREAM
T-Rex: Phew, it was all a dream!
T-Rex: The mission to find the treasure, the car chase: all a dream!
T-Rex: My high school math teacher naked and smiling: all a dream!
T-Rex: That bizarre thing with the Utahraptor that I don't want to talk about: all a dream!
Utahraptor: Wait, what was this about me?
T-Rex: It was nothing: just a crazy dream!
T-Rex: You must have had crazy dreams before!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but are we talking crazy insane or crazy sexual?
T-Rex: Crazy sexual!
T-Rex (punchline): I've said too much!


Narrator: COMPRESSED NOVEL COMICS today's novel PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
T-Rex: ...I didn't read the book.
God: WHAT
T-Rex: I didn't read the book!!
T-Rex: Look, I saw the movie and here's what happens: Mr. Darcy is a dick, later on he's still a dick, Elizabeth falls in love with him for no reason, they get married and he stops being a dick I guess.
God: USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JANE AUSTEN NOVELS THEY DON'T USE THE WORD "DICK"
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: If only, if only.
Utahraptor: Elizabeth doesn't fall in love with him for no reason!
T-Rex: She totally does!
T-Rex: They spend the whole time insulting each other and then near the end they love each other and you're like, "What? Since when?!"
Utahraptor: I wasn't like that!
T-Rex: Well I was! I said it out loud! It was on the bus so it was embarrassing!!
Narrator: EARLIER BUSTIMES:
T-Rex: What? Since when?!
Off panel: Excuse me, sir?
T-Rex: Oh, I'm reading Jane Austen.
Off panel: Bro!
Off panel (punchline): Don't even get me started, bro


T-Rex: An expansive vocabulary allows you to express the most subtle nuances of thought, sentences whose exquisite sentiment is simply beyond the reach of those who find within themselves only the most common and ordinary words.
Narrator: OBSOLETE VOCABULARY WORDS FOR THE IMMATURE
T-Rex: Like oh I don't know "SPERMOPHILE"?? That's someone who loves eating seeds! Not to mention "spermologer", which is a gossipmonger.
Dromiceiomimus: Hilarious.
T-Rex: Yes, I don't want to appear to be a "cockalorum" (a boastful dude), but I'd be happy to "dicker" (barter or trade) for new words that sound like sex stuff words!!
Utahraptor: If I don't share MY obsolete words with you, are you gonna have a... PUSSYVAN??
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: It means "tantrum", T-Rex. Enjoy.
T-Rex: PUSSYVAN. Oh my god. Here I thought I was Mister Cool with my "pussy-hoisting" (stealing furs) but PUSSYVAN?? PUSSYVAN. I'm bringing it back! I'm gonna make a giant banner and everything, at my own considerable expense!!
Banner: Pussyvan
T-Rex (punchline): I REGRET NOTHING


T-Rex: Parents! You may be prepared to talk to your teens about sex and their changing bodies, but do you know how to talk to your teens...
T-Rex: ...about INFINITE SERIES?
T-Rex: There will come a time when your child, for entirely natural reasons, will start to be curious about sex, their changing bodies, and what happens when you add infinitely many numbers to a given starting quantity. They may even, in private, start to experiment with both their bodies and with examining what it means when a sequence of partial sums converges onto a single value!
T-Rex: Remember: it's normal, you did this too, and there's nothing shameful about it.
Utahraptor: Absolutely!
Utahraptor: What's important is they experiment safely. Let them know that they can come to you with any questions about sexuality, consent, or if Euler's number can be described by the sum of an infinite harmonic series and if not, why not. They should know you're here to help, without shame or judgment. Relax, listen, and encourage!
T-Rex (punchline): Frank talk about infinite series may embarrass you, but your teens will know they can come to you with anything. They'll grow into wonderful and complete people, fully comfortable with who they are, what they want, and why the Leibniz formula for pi converges in sublinear time.


Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD LOSE ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
T-Rex: My sense of proprioception!
T-Rex: That's the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time!
T-Rex: And it's ALSO a sense that gets dulled when you drink, which is why you have trouble touching your nose with your eyes closed in such situations. You're forced to rely on proprioception, and with it dulled, you miss! You poke out your eye with your hand or whatever.
T-Rex: Proprioception!
Utahraptor: And you really want to be CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED about where your limbs are when you can't see them?
T-Rex: Maybe!
Utahraptor: You know what? I don't think you would! I think you ACTUALLY chose proprioception because it's not one of the classical five senses, and you wanted to be Mr. "Look At Me Guys I Chose An Unexpected Answer".
T-Rex: Oh, it's true! But I messed up. I'd really prefer losing nociception: the sense of pain!
Narrator: BUT THAT IS A LIE TOO!
Off panel: T-Rex, I'm afraid this accident has robbed you of one of your senses: the sense of what's appropriate in a given social situation!
T-Rex (punchline): yessssss


T-Rex: [thinks] Cramming chocolate bars into ice cream
T-Rex: OMG, that's a brilliant idea!
T-Rex: OMG, what if that's my last brilliant idea? What if I just honestly had my last great idea, and from here on out it's all duds??
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think that's likely, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Because it's more likely I'll have INFINITY good ideas? I'll just be a good idea factory until my body GIVES OUT from the stress of CONSTANT BRILLIANCE??
Utahraptor: Dude, calm down!
T-Rex: AHHHHHHHHH
Utahraptor: You might've had your last BRILLIANT idea, but you've still got your Just Okay ideas! You'll be able to milk those for a while. And when you're done, there'll always be your Bad Ideas, your Terrible Ideas, your Ideas That A Baby Could Come Up With And That Same Baby Would Be Driven To Dismiss Them As Stupid.

T-Rex: Guys, I could die tomorrow! But that's not the worst of it!
T-Rex: I COULD TOTALLY BE DYING RIGHT NOW.
T-Rex: And I'm not even talking about that "we're all dying every second of our life" thing because YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, we're all dying all the time, thanks for reminding me, Captain I Say Stupid Things At Parties. I meant that I could be in the first stages of head-explosion disease or any other affliction that can end a life suddenly and without warning! Right this instant!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but the same goes for all of us!
T-Rex: That's supposed to make me feel better?
T-Rex: That any one of my friends could die without a moment's notice? Oh, thanks, I feel way better now!
Utahraptor: It wasn't supposed to cheer you up, T-Rex.
Utahraptor: It was supposed to warn you.
T-Rex: [stops daydreaming]
T-Rex: Well, I'd like to thank last night for that little dream, as well as the movie I watched before bed for the inspiration!
T-Rex (punchline): Oh! And my subconscious for these waking nightmares that haunt me still!

Dromiceiomimus: Man, I was just saying hi.
T-Rex: Please hold.

Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Hi, and thank you for reaching out. We're currently experiencing a higher than expected conversation request volume. Your current wait time to speak to your friend is [FIVE] minutes.
Utahraptor: Eugh. NEVERMIND.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hi, we noticed you recently interacted with [T-REX]. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being highest, how much did you enjoy [CONVERSING WITH T-REX]?
Off panel: ZERO.
T-Rex: Thank you for your feedback.
T-Rex (punchline): Your feedback has been [DISCARDED].


T-Rex: Pick a number between one and ten!
T-Rex: Got it? Good!
T-Rex: Now pick a favourite fruit. Got the number and the fruit? Great, we're almost done. Now, let's finish this up by making one more choice at random: a colour! Got the number, fruit, and colour? You're thinking of them right now, right?
Dromiceiomimus: Yep!
T-Rex: Great, because here comes the magic! Your choices are...
T-Rex: ...7, apple, and green!
Utahraptor: Nope!
T-Rex: Sure, it didn't work out for YOU, but there's a parallel universe in which someone hearing my words DID randomly choose those things, and right now it's BLOWING THEIR MIND.
Utahraptor: Unless they stuck around to hear you describing how you did the trick just by playing the odds, in which case, again, no.
T-Rex: Ah, but you see, there's also a parallel universe in which they stopped listening to me just before I said that.
Off panel: Oh.
T-Rex (punchline): I tell you, bud: there's a universe out there in which things are turning out PRET-TY SWEET for ol' T-Rex


T-Rex: In my new video game, you control a lady named "Mary Oh". She's of Chinese descent, which explains her awesome name! But her boyfriend has been kidnapped!
T-Rex: You and your half-sister Lucy "Lu" Igi have to save him!
T-Rex: But as you set out to rescue your boyfriend, Prince Estoban, you start to notice every enemy you face, from the Goombas to the Hammer Sisters to the Lakitus: they're all women. Even the bullets fired at you, which you'd expect to be genderless, are named "Bullet Belle". There's not a single man in this game, besides your kidnapped boyfriend!
Dromiceiomimus: This is just Mario with the genders flipped!
T-Rex: Hah! "JUST".
Utahraptor: And the Prince is kidnapped by "Bowsella"?
T-Rex: Nope! I ripped off something way more awesome!
T-Rex: It turns out he's not kidnapped at all, he just left without leaving a note and got his OVER ONE THOUSAND EVIL EXES to fight you. And YES that means he's a guy who's had sex with mushrooms and turtles and - like, bullets?
T-Rex: Don't look at me. He's YOUR boyfriend, Mary.
T-Rex: I call my game, "Super Mary Oh And The Slutty Dude"!
T-Rex (punchline): Subtitle: "Oh Mary, No Girl, You're Better Than This"


Narrator: EIGHT YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for being remembered! And *I* will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times. Right in the bum!
Narrator: NOW:
T-Rex: [thinks] kangaroo kicks
T-Rex: Aw frig!!
T-Rex: I was supposed to be kicking kangaroos all this time and my kangaroo kick count is still only at - what, five? I NEED TO UP MY GAME BY SEVERAL NOTCHES. What if... what if I kicked a kangaroo TWO thousand times instead?
Dromiceiomimus: What if you found something to do that bettered yourself AND the world around you?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus
T-Rex: I'm not sure what you think kicking a kangaroo is
Utahraptor: Yeah, I don't get this kangaroo kicking thing either!
T-Rex: It's trackable!
T-Rex: I dedicate my life to working tirelessly for the greater good, and I never know if I'm making progress. I dedicate my life to kicking an evil kangaroo two thousand times, and with every kick I can say "Hey! PROGRESS."
Utahraptor: But do something positive! Donate $100 to charity two thousand times instead!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): ...I'm already five kicks in dude; I'm kinda committed now


T-Rex: I know like five Emilys, and that is four too many Emilys! Apparently there are only like 13 girl names??
Narrator: THE THIRTEEN GIRL NAMES
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
Dromiceiomimus: Jenn / Jennifer!
T-Rex: Jess / Jessifer!
Dromiceiomimus: Jeppo!
T-Rex: Emily!
Dromiceiomimus: Samantha!
T-Rex: Ezmerelda!
Dromiceiomimus: Tabbyhanita!
T-Rex: Peterella!
Dromiceiomimus: Miss Steve!
T-Rex: Porker!
Dromiceiomimus: Que-ball!
T-Rex: The Whiz!
Utahraptor: Didn't you forget about... SHANNON?
T-Rex: Hah! Please.
T-Rex: "Shannon" is clearly a corruption of "Miss Hannon", which is itself a crude combination of "Miss Steve" and "Tabbyhanita".
Utahraptor: Ah. Well. That was my only objection.
T-Rex: Perfect!!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: Hello, T-Rex! I am a woman and my name is... SARAH.
T-Rex: Hah! NICE TRY, PORKER!
Off panel (punchline): Damn it HOW DID YOU KNOW


T-Rex: Did you know that human babies don't even come out with teeth?
T-Rex: It's totally true! They're like - all gums!
T-Rex: "But then how do they catch their prey?" you ask? Easy: they don't!
Dromiceiomimus: They don't?
T-Rex: Nope! INSTEAD, they feed off the juices they suck out of their mother's chest!
T-Rex: ...Mammals, man.
T-Rex: "Mammals".
Utahraptor: Dude, are you being mammals racist?
T-Rex: No, I love mammals! I just think they're UNUSUAL, and weirdly big into mammaries. They're so big into mams that they put it right in their name!
Utahraptor: Well, we're "dinosaurs".
T-Rex: Exactly! TERRIBLE (IN THE POWERFUL SENSE) LIZARDS. We don't define ourselves by our BOOBS.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (punchline): Also our skeletons look way more badass, not trying to start a fight here just stating facts


Text: The Woman Who Woke Up As A Man
Text: by T-Rex
Text: Once upon a time there was a woman who woke up as a man! That's her. Pretty tough, right? Frig!
Text: Anyway she woke up as a totally tough dude, stepping on houses like they were toy Monopoly houses, like in the picture? Everyone liked her. But her female form was missing and eventually people thought that she was murdered! Nobody believed her that she was a dude now and they thought maybe HE (the girl) murdered her (herself). She went to jail and EVENTUALLY, she died in jail, from a terminal case of too much being... in jail.
Text: THE END
Utahraptor: T-Rex, I read your comic! The one you slipped under my door with the note "FEEDBACK PLZ ;)"?
T-Rex: And?
Utahraptor: Well, okay, you don't explain how or why the woman switched sexes, and I don't get why you wrote a story where a guy who looks like you is a woman, only to basically ignore the premise. And um, the ending was among the most unsatisfying I'd ever read.
T-Rex: I see!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST!
T-Rex: T-Rex, it's me, T-Rex from the future! Don't let Utahraptor read your comic because he's going to be a dick about it, okay?
Off panel: I still say "dick" in the future?
T-Rex (punchline): I'm from like 2 hours in the future, so YEAH


Narrator: "HORSES VS. TRAINS"
T-Rex: Ah, the age-old debate! Horses are okay.
T-Rex: If you don't have any trains around, that is!!
T-Rex: Horses eat grass. Trains are huge multi-ton machines that GET THINGS DONE. And then when you think trains are as great as it gets, you discover maglev trains! These are literal HOVERTRAINS that wrote in their diaries, "Screw it, diary! I'm just gonna go as fast as I can from now on!!" and then they go 581 km/h like it's no big deal. NICE.
T-Rex: Horses eat grass, and SOMETIMES, hop over buckets.
Utahraptor: I guess the old stereotype of boys liking trains is true!
T-Rex: Come on, that's dumb!
T-Rex: I like trains because they're big complicated machines that NOT ONLY get folks places quickly, but also, threaten maidens tied to the tracks by mustachio-twirling villains. If horses could do that I would like horses too.
Utahraptor: I'm pretty sure horses CAN do that.
T-Rex: WELL THEN. I GUESS I'M A FAN OF HORSES.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: EXCUSE ME LIBRARIAN DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS ON HORSES
Off panel: Yes sir! We have many books on many topics, here at your local library!
T-Rex: THANK YOU
T-Rex (punchline): PRETTY SURE ONE WILL SUFFICE


T-Rex: "There's no such thing as a free lunch!"
T-Rex: FALSE.
T-Rex: I have been to one, and don't freak out, but it was delicious AND free.
Dromiceiomimus: When economists say that, what they mean is you can't get something for nothing. That free lunch was offered by someone with an agenda, yes?
T-Rex: They wanted me to buy timeshares but didn't realize *I* cared only for lunch and the placing of lunch inside me!!
T-Rex: But there's still free lunches: Agent X buys lunch, eats it, and is satisfied!
Utahraptor: But she's paid for that!
T-Rex: SURE, but AFTER she's satisfied, she throws out the leftovers and then LATER, I eat them from the garbage. OH SNAP: A FREE LUNCH, and the only effect on the universe is a sanitation worker has slightly less work to do. I literally make their lives easier, AND I make the food system as a whole more efficient.
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm pretty much history's greatest dinosaur


T-Rex: Okay, so we all know when we look at distant stars, we're actually seeing what they looked like long ago, since light takes time to reach us. But light takes time to travel anywhere, EVEN JUST ACROSS THE ROOM. So when I'm looking at my hands -
T-Rex: - AND I INDULGE IN THIS ACTIVITY OFTEN -
T-Rex: - I'm actually looking at past hands! I've NEVER seen my hands as they currently are. I live in the present and I totally spend all my time there, but I'm constantly surrounded by ghostly images of times gone by! We talk, Dromiceiomimus, but all I can see is your ghost!! Can you feel yourself tripping ALL the balls??
Dromiceiomimus: W-
T-Rex: We're leaving no ball left untripped here, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, even if your hands were 5m from your eyes, you know how long light takes to travel that? 16.7 NANOseconds.
T-Rex: So?
T-Rex: That's not a problem? Utahraptor, I'm ASSUMING you're still here, but you could've disappeared already and I'd have NO IDEA. You could disappear at any point during our CONVERSATIONAL INTERCOURSE and I'd only find out about it like 16.7 nanoseconds l-
T-Rex (punchline): whoah


Narrator: INCREDIBLE MOMENTS IN HISTORY
Narrator: STARRING T-REX THE DINOSAUR
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you know how scientists are always getting, like, Nobel Prizes in science stuff?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!
T-Rex: Do you know if you can get that with dance moves too? Because I'm PRETTY SURE I just invented an amazing new dance move!!
Utahraptor: Let's see this move!
T-Rex: Right! I start with my leg raised as so, and then -
T-Rex: Leg down, tail down, head snap, POSE.
Utahraptor: Not bad, not bad!
T-Rex: Hey! Hey, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: Take a picture, it'll last longer!
Narrator: THIS MARKS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME THE PHRASE "TAKE A PICTURE, IT'LL LAST LONGER" WAS EVER SAID SINCERELY
Narrator (punchline): THE END


T-Rex: You guys!
T-Rex: Let's assume the universe is deterministic!!
T-Rex: And if that's true we're no more responsible for our actions than a computer is for executing code. We have no choice in what happens to us, and if you set up the universe in the exact same way we'd make the same choices and the exact same things would happen. Free will is therefore an illusion! Like a computer, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS.
Utahraptor: Geez. Let's assume the universe is indeterministic then!
T-Rex: Even better!
T-Rex: Then things can happen randomly with no event responsible for causing them. And anything random (which includes every decision we make, unless you want them to be deterministic!) you can't be held responsible for, so therefore AGAIN we're not responsible for anything we do.
Utahraptor: Huh.
T-Rex: Anyway, LONG STORY SHORT:
T-Rex (punchline): I have it on good authority that somebody tooted just now but SADLY, we have no-one to blame


T-Rex: Sometimes a thing you love comes to an end! And rather than being sad, it's better to accept that all things have endings...
T-Rex: ...and be happy for the time you shared!
Dromiceiomimus: Pfft, are you kidding me? NOTHING comes to an end anymore. It just gets rebooted for a new generation!
T-Rex: Oh, I wasn't thinking of like, movies and TV shows. I was thinking more like, a friendship ending or -
Dromiceiomimus: REBOOT THE FRIENDSHIP WITH A NEW CAST!!
Utahraptor: Ooh, and a darker and edgier aesthetic!
T-Rex: I don't want to "reboot" any friendships!!
T-Rex: If a friendship ends, I want a new friendship! I don't want a remix of the old one, with things I already know played back to me in a winky "remember this" sort of way! Give me something NEW, something VITAL, something that challenges me in a way I've NEVER been challenged before!!
Off panel: Uh-huh. And what would you say if I said I have a clone identical in every way EXCEPT he has an eyepatch, a goatee, and a devil-may-care attitude with the smile to match??
T-Rex (punchline): UTAHRAPTOR ARE YOU JOKING BECAUSE I TAKE IT ALL BACK AND I WANT TO BEFRIEND REMIX UTAHRAPTOR


God: T-REX LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ALL VIDEOGAMES ARE ACTUALLY JUST MURDER SIMULATORS
T-Rex: It's Controversy Monday!
T-Rex: Controversy Monday is the day when you needlessly volunteer made up opinions on abortion!
God: YEAH I KNOW BUT DUDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VIDEOGAMES HERE AND I SAW ON TV THAT EVERY TEEN KILLER PLAYS DOOM EVEN THOUGH IT'S LIKE 15 YEARS OLD
T-Rex: Can we accept that there will always be some unstable people who will go off with any stimulus, and that others can't be held responsible?
God: UM
God: NOT ON CONTROVERSY MONDAY
Utahraptor: Are we to discount these people, though?
T-Rex: Yes! They're CRAZY.
Utahraptor: Okay, but the fact is that if a given stimulus (game, book, movie whatever) WASN'T there, then they wouldn't have gone all crazy at the same time, place, or even at all!
T-Rex: TRUE, but that's ridiculous. That's like saying that if your parents had conceived differently you wouldn't have been born...
T-Rex: ...thereby making THEM responsible for the fact that you came over last night and ate all my damn pastries!
Off panel: I was just preparing for Controversy Monday!
T-Rex (punchline): YOU WERE JUST PREPARING FOR YOUR BELLY SWELLING WITH MY SO DELICIOUS PASTRIES


Narrator: TIPS ON FATHERHOOD from a man who has never been a father
T-Rex: That's me, baby!!
T-Rex: If you're a father you need to be rad, okay??
T-Rex: And then you need you make sure your child grows up to be EVEN RADDER THAN YOU, because that way we all get more rad as time goes on. And that's something we all can enjoy!
Dromiceiomimus: These aren't very practical tips, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Um, NAME ONE SITUATION IN WHICH RADNESS ISN'T PRACTICAL??
Utahraptor: Let us say that we agree radness is practical in all situations.
T-Rex: Yes! LET US.
Utahraptor: But I think what Dromiceiomimus was getting at is if you're a father, being told to "be rad" isn't very pragmatic. Let's hear some clear, concise tips on how to be a rad father! How do we get to that finish line?
T-Rex: Oh-kay!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Okay! Utahraptor, you know those "#1 Dad" mugs? They make thousands of those. You can buy them in bulk.
Off panel: So?
T-Rex: So the only tip I've got is this!
T-Rex (punchline): DUE TO CONTINUAL MISMANAGEMENT, I'm not sure the award has any meaning left


Narrator: THE STORY OF ROBIN HOOD
T-Rex: Robin Hood was a guy who lived in the forest with some of his chums. Guys, he made tree forts!
T-Rex: He ALSO stole from the rich and gave to the poor!
T-Rex: He made tree forts AND crimes. And the Sheriff of Nottingham didn't like this one bit! He was a good sheriff who believed in the rule of law and the court system. He took his job and his sheriff school degree very seriously and always did his best. He said, "Not only will I arrest Robin Hood for 'robbin' from rich people, but I will also sword fight him if he wants, and I will marry his girlfriend. I really hope that will teach him to obey the law!"
Utahraptor: Did it work?
T-Rex: HECK NO.
T-Rex: Robin's girlfriend didn't want to marry the Sheriff, and then to make matters worse, Robin Hood killed the Sheriff and his men! The Sheriff's last words were "I'm sorry I could never convince you, Robin, to work for positive change from within the system."
Utahraptor: What an amazing tale!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (punchline): DANG I got that all backwards


Narrator: THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO TOAST:
T-Rex: So yeah, as I was saying, the relativist fallacy is when you reject a claim by saying "Oh, that may be true for you, but it's not true for me."
God: HUH
T-Rex: But you have to be careful: the fallacy only applies to objective facts!
T-Rex: So if I say "the atomic mass of xenon is 131.3 AMU", a response of "Oh, maybe it is for YOU!" is a fallacy. But if I said "toast is the ultimate breakfast-time treat", you could very well respond with "maybe for YOU, not for ME" and it wouldn't be a fallacy, because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal.
Utahraptor: Who are you explaining the relativist fallacy to?
T-Rex: Oh, just God!
T-Rex: He was asking me what the weight of xenon was and I was all "Duh, 131.3 AMU" and he was all "Duh, maybe for you, T-Rex" and I was all, "Aha! Time to pontificate!" Then I worked in an example about toast.
T-Rex and Utahraptor: HEY! Let's go get some toast!
T-Rex (punchline): It all comes back to toast!


Sign: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Today's letter to Professor Science comes from Alexis, who writes:
T-Rex: "Dear Professor, how much would it cost to buy the WHOLE DANG PLANET??"
T-Rex: Wow! I guess we need to know how much our planet is worth, then. I'm guessing... a kabazillion dollars?
Dromiceiomimus: What if we took the sum value of all the world's currencies? That'd tell us how much everything is worth, in total!
T-Rex: That works, right? Because money itself isn't worth anything, but we all PRETEND it's worth the value of the goods it's traded for, right?
Utahraptor: Except that doesn't include oceans and stuff - things you can't buy!
T-Rex: TRUE.
Utahraptor: Plus, buying the WHOLE DANG PLANET also means buying everything on it, and that means we now have to put a price on LIFE ITSELF.
T-Rex: I always knew this day would come, Utahraptor. I - I just never thought it'd be soon.
T-Rex: Alright! Life itself is, what - like twenty bucks?
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Professor Science, can we SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE that people are wrong for getting mad at me for saying life is worth like twenty bucks? It grows in crusty milk, it is like the most free thing ever!!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): PROFESSOR ARE YOU EVEN HOME
