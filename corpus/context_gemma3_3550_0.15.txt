Narrator: INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGES FOR TEENS
T-Rex: Teens! Do you ever get sad? Do you ever think "what am I supposed to do: the world is a mess right now...
T-Rex: ...and how are we, a single generation of cool teens, supposed to fix it?"
T-Rex: Do you go on to think that 250 years ago the amount of damage a single generation could do was limited in scope, but the industrial revolution gave a long-dead generation the ability to alter our planet's climate such that areas of it could eventually become inhospitable, which they gleefully did for massive profit, and whose consequences are only becoming apparent now?
Utahraptor: Teens, do you worry that power structures in place are permanent? Are you concerned there's no place in them for you??
T-Rex: Or do you worry the opposite: that the proliferation of nuclear weapons means a single person could inhibit this planet's ability to sustain us, which makes revolution AGAINST those power structures simply too dangerous? Well, here's what I have to say to all of THAT:
T-Rex: ...Holy crap, that's rough, and I gotta admit that I'm in WAY over my head on this one!
T-Rex (punchline): Well bye


T-Rex: Attention, everyone! Who wants to hear my opinions?
God: BOOOORING
T-Rex: They're opinions about sex!!
God: YO I'M IN
T-Rex: Well, actually, they're opinions about the WORDS we use for sex!
God: AW MAN
T-Rex: So people of all genders and orientations can say "I'd hit that" to mean "I would have sex with that", and it's SO WEIRD that we all equate sex to violence, that a pleasant sexy experience gets boiled down to "synonym for punch". And it's not just hit! You can get demolished in bed too!
T-Rex: I UNDERSTAND IT'S PRETTY FUN, ACTUALLY.
Utahraptor: Bad news, dude: we use violence to describe ALL SORTS OF THINGS!!
T-Rex: Oh no!
Utahraptor: If you do well in a presentation you were KILLING up there.
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: "Punch it" means go fast!
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: And even if we just sit around doing nothing, I can still say that we're KICKING IT.
T-Rex: *gaaaaaaaaaaaaasp*
T-Rex: Utahraptor I'm actually having trouble breathing here! I need 20 ccs of hospitals please!!
T-Rex: *gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasp*
T-Rex (punchline): STAT


T-Rex: Yes indeed, I'm old enough that I get to decide where I want to live! And that means I want to live RIGHT HERE.
T-Rex: It's where all my friends pal around!
Dromiceiomimus: Aww, that's very sweet T-Rex, but we'd hate to be the reason you don't go out and explore the world. Don't treat us like an anchor!
T-Rex: I'm not! I'm still going to travel if I want to. But if here is good, why would I move somewhere else where I have to make all NEW friends? I'm initially not the most likeable guy, Dromiceiomimus.
T-Rex: I - I step on stuff
Utahraptor: Man, but now you're an anchor for us!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: We can't move away, because WE'LL feel bad that you stayed because of us and now, we're leaving!
T-Rex: And I wouldn't be able to follow you because that would make ME seem needy and insecure!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: This is a disaster!
T-Rex: Want to never talk about our relationship like this again?
Off panel (punchline): DONE


T-Rex: My new book is called "BILLY THE TEEN! BILLY WAS THE TEEN... WHO LOVED BEING A TEEN!"
T-Rex: (It's aimed towards teens!)
T-Rex: So, after clearly being established as a teen, Billy goes off and meets some other teens! They become friends and they hang around outside fast-food restaurants, and sometimes, they go in and get some fast food FROM the restaurant. Later, Billy announces that he just plain loves being a teen! All his friends nod their heads in ready agreement.
Utahraptor: And then what happens?
T-Rex: A few pages in, Billy realizes his 20th birthday is coming up!
T-Rex: He'll no longer be a teen. It's a disaster! He's TERRIFIED. He's waking up in cold sweats. Billy's certain that when he becomes 20 he'll lose something vital of himself.
Utahraptor: And then?
T-Rex: And then... he dies of a heart attack!
T-Rex (punchline): But like, 50 years later, you know? Long after he's come to terms with everything. The vast bulk of the book details Billy's entire adult life, and the last page says "The actual title this book is 'Mr. Bill Peterson, Who Came To Terms with His Life Over 60 Years'".


T-Rex: Once upon a time, I, T-Rex, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly.
T-Rex: I was unaware that I was T-Rex!
T-Rex: Soon I awoke, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a dinosaur dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a dinosaur!
Dromiceiomimus: A dinosaur dreaming that he's plagiarizing 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi?
T-Rex: WHO CAN SAY??
Utahraptor: Good news: butterflies don't have the neural capacity to sustain our shared reality!
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: Butterflies! Tiny brains. They literally can't simulate something so complicated and consistent as the reality you're now experiencing. So hooray, you're not a butterfly!
T-Rex: Huh. Maybe I'm a larger animal: a dog, perhaps? Some manner of giraffe?
T-Rex: A sentient universe-spanning computational intelligence, the ultimate end-point of evolution and the Final Mind of all creation??
Off panel: Yes, that'd likely have enough processing power to simulate one dude's life.
T-Rex (punchline): NIIIIIIICE


T-Rex: All funny t-shirts use the same unmodified t-shirt canvas:
T-Rex: Slogan on the front! And maybe on the back sometimes!
T-Rex: Forget that, man! Let's kick it up a notch or two! Let's break free of our self-imposed t-shirt boundaries.
Dromiceiomimus: How? Funny sweaters? Funny evening gowns? Funny HOSIERY?
T-Rex: Layers, Dromiceiomimus! SEQUENCES.
T-Rex: Beneath an "I'M WITH STUPID" shirt, wear another one that says "NO, NOT REALLY".
Utahraptor: Handy in case Stupid gets mad!
T-Rex: Exactly! And beneath that, another shirt that says "IF I WAS STANDING NEXT TO A VISIBLE MINORITY WITH THE OTHER SHIRT I DIDN'T MEAN IT AND I APOLOGIZE!!" Beneath that, "YOU GUYS, I'M NOT ACTUALLY RACIST"; beneath that, "IT WAS JUST THE UNFORTUNATE JUXTAPOSITION OF MY SHIRT FROM 4 SHIRTS AGO AND A PERSON"
T-Rex: I was inspired when I saw a racist person stripping!
T-Rex (punchline): I thought, wow, if only they'd been wearing the shirts I just invented.


T-Rex: There's this crazy rash I've got on my wrist. This is an unwelcome development that I did not invite!
T-Rex: Forget you, crazy rash!
Dromiceiomimus: Have you done anything to try to get rid of it?
T-Rex: I am a firm believer in the "do nothing and your problems will take care of themselves" school of problem solving.
Dromiceiomimus: Really? Well - good luck!
Utahraptor: Has this technique ever solved ANY of your problems, T-Rex?
T-Rex: All the time!
T-Rex: Like this one time, I had to pay my phone bill, but it's sort of a pain to mail stuff, you know? So I just waited and waited and eventually a collections agency called ME, and they let me pay my bill over the phone!
Utahraptor: But there are conseq-
T-Rex: It was amazing!
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER THE RASH GETS WORSE:
T-Rex: ATTENTION, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS!!
T-Rex (punchline): Why don't you call?


Narrator: A MAN WALKS INTO A BAR explained
T-Rex: Many jokes begin with this line. It is called the "set-up", and is analogous to establishing-shots in films or first paragraphs in essays.
T-Rex: It alerts the audience that what follows is likely to be a short story with a humourous climax!
T-Rex: What is the attraction to this structure of humour? Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars?
T-Rex: Part of the attraction to this structure may be its possibilities: most anything can happen in a bar, especially if this bar is contained within the wild and woolly world of the verbal jest.
Utahraptor: What about the joke, "A man walks into a bar... ouch!"?
T-Rex: Good question!
T-Rex: The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience, an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment.
Utahraptor: Go on!
T-Rex: The "ouch" is startling. How could entering a bar hurt? It forces us to now re-evaluate our most basic assumptions.
T-Rex: We must ask ourselves, "What if the bar was an bar proper, and by walking into it the man actually, physically, walked into it?"
T-Rex (punchline): It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humour!


Mysterious Commercial Voice: EVER FORGOTTEN SOMEONE'S NAME?
T-Rex: Yes!
Mysterious Commercial Voice: EVER WISHED YOU'D REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
Mysterious Commercial Voice: NOT ANYMORE!
T-Rex: Oh phew what a relief
Mysterious Commercial Voice: WITH ONE MINOR SURGERY A MICROCHIP WILL BE INSTALLED IN YOUR BRAIN, AND FORGETTING WILL BECOME A DELIBERATE ACT.
T-Rex: So if I want to remember something I still have to make room by deleting some old memory, but at least I'll be able to choose which one?
Mysterious Commercial Voice: PRECISELY
T-Rex: Mysterious commercial voice selling me something: I AM ALL FOR THIS.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, remember remember the 5th of November!
T-Rex: Can do, friend!
T-Rex: Hmm, a bit tight on space here. Yo, should I delete /MEMORIES2000/old memories/HiGhScHoOL/stuff/stuff222/whatever.dat, or /MEMORIES/unsorted/how_to_play_power_rangers_theme_on_a_touchtone_phone.txt??
Utahraptor: Ooh. Save that last one for sure.
T-Rex: DONE.
Narrator: LATER, T-REX REALIZES HE CAN'T REMEMBER THE SOUND OF HER VOICE:
T-Rex (punchline): Maaaaaan


T-Rex: I am a guy who is not that great a dancer. Ummm...
T-Rex: SORRY, I GUESS??
T-Rex: So I looked into it and it turns out beat deafness is a thing! I could have an ACTUAL BRAIN THING that prevents me from hearing beats, which could ALSO explain several other things, including why I find it so tricky to rock a rhyme that's right on time!!
Dromiceiomimus: That's tricky?
T-Rex: Tricky
Dromiceiomimus: Tricky
T-Rex: Trrrrrrricky
Utahraptor: You're not alone in this, you know!
T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yep! Lots of animals can't detect beats either... including DOGS.
T-Rex: OH MY GOD. This only serves to bring me closer to my ultimate fantasy of BECOMING a dog! If ONLY there were some handy mnemonic to remember this fact??
Utahraptor: *ahem*
Off panel: It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, for doggies!
T-Rex: Doggies
Off panel: Doggies
T-Rex: Doggies
Off panel (punchline): Doggies


T-Rex: The year is 1990, and the world is a very different place! All those old TV shows you liked are still new! But more importantly:
T-Rex: The sentence "Like us on Facebook" has NEVER EVER been said!
T-Rex: Those were halcyon times! In 1990, the very construction "like us on" was weird, and could really only be finished with "your own terms, please."
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, do you realize what this means?!
T-Rex: ...We should all definitely remember the 90s right now?
Dromiceiomimus: NO. The first person who ever said "Like us on Facebook" is likely STILL ALIVE.
T-Rex: Oh my gosh.
Utahraptor: OH MY GOSH.
T-Rex: This is like finding out the person who invented the phrase "talk to the hand" is still alive!
Utahraptor: Well, that's from the 90s, so - yeah. They're out there. They may even be friends!
T-Rex: OH MY GOSH, CAN YOU IMAGINE??
T-Rex: "Like us on Facebook!" "Talk to the hand!" "I will if you like us on Facebook!" "I will if you address your comments towards my hand!"
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): Hah! God damn, what a couple of clowns.


Narrator: T-REX HAS SNUCK INTO UTAHRAPTOR'S HOUSE AND SWITCHED THE HOT AND COLD PIPES LEADING TO HIS BATHROOM SINK.
T-Rex: Tee hee!
Narrator: LET'S WATCH!
Dromiceiomimus: Isn't that kind of an expensive, elaborate prank, T-Rex? The worst that'll happen is he'll get cold water when he expects hot.
T-Rex: Hilarious!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe he'll burn himself a little!
T-Rex: COMEDY RELENTLESSLY ENSUES??
Utahraptor: Hey T-Rex! What's new?
T-Rex: Hey Utahraptor! How's your bathroom sink treating you?
Utahraptor: Oh, same old, same old! "The good ol' bathroom sink", you know? Good ol' reliable Whitey!
T-Rex: Huh!
T-Rex: Well! I guess I'm not a qualified plumber after all!
Narrator: BUT, THREE PLUMBING DEGREES LATER!
T-Rex: Hey Utahraptor! How's your bathroom sink treating you?
Off panel: Whitey's hot and cold pipes got reversed!
T-Rex (punchline): Awesome, man! Awesome!!


T-Rex: Ah, yes. Time to re-read a favourite book from my childhood! Nothing could possibly go wrong!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Uh... THIS BOOK IS BAD AND NOT GOOD TO READ??
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, my childhood favourite is hot garbage! Not even hot garbage: LUKEWARM garbage. When I wasn't looking it got... BAD!
Dromiceiomimus: It's almost like any work of art is NOT a stand-alone document but rather something that exists as a conversation between text and reader, and as such, it can never be experienced in the same way twice and is as ephemeral as your ever-changing self!!
T-Rex: Aw man! Boo to THAT!!
Utahraptor: What are we booing?
T-Rex: The fact that art comes to life only when experienced BY a reader, therefore it's not fully contained in the text, therefore even the most cherished childhood memories can turn to ashes in your mouth.
Utahraptor: Hah hah hah!
Utahraptor: YEP
Off panel: Hey, speaking of: have you noticed the more you recall a favourite memory, the more it flattens, like you're remembering your later recollection of it rather than the original event?
T-Rex: ...No?
Off panel: Oh!!
Off panel (punchline): ...Something to look forward to, then


T-Rex: Raccoons wash their food before they eat it, using their baleful, probing, nimble hands. We used to think they did this because they enjoyed being super adorable!
T-Rex: Hah, whoops! MY MISTAKE!
T-Rex: I didn't mean to say "adorable"; I meant to say "insanely creepy, washing their food while maintaining unbroken eye contact with you, licking their lips slowly over and over again, thinking only one phrase: 'I EAT DEATH'".
T-Rex: Anyway.
T-Rex: Then we thought they did it because they didn't have enough saliva and therefore liked their food pre-moistened!
T-Rex: But now we think it's because they have sensitive hands!
Utahraptor: Sensitive hands?
T-Rex: Yeah. Raccoons have these sensitive hands, and they're checking out what they're about to eat, and water helps makes them more sensitive.
Utahraptor: Neat!
T-Rex: But the POINT is that if you give a raccoon a sugar cube, it'll wash it, and then the sugar will dissolve! HILARIOUS!
T-Rex: It is the only way I have left to revenge myself on them, and I don't think they're going to tolerate it for much longer. AND YET, I'M NOT STOPPING!
T-Rex (punchline): ...Tell them my story, Utahraptor


T-Rex: How do you get your name on a street sign? Is there like, a place where I can slap my name down and say "So hey, I heard THAT name's really rad"?
T-Rex: I really want to live on "T-Rex Lane", you guys!
T-Rex: Obviously, my IDEAL address would be "80085 T-Rex Lane, T-Topia, Rexland", but, you know, one step at a time. So: street names! How do I get in on that?
Dromiceiomimus: Well, if you're a local politician your odds are improved through CRONYISM, and I guess if your last name was like, "Lakeview", you'd have better odds too.
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, this advice's Helpful Rating is currently at ZERO!!
Utahraptor: If you're someone famous, that helps too!
T-Rex: OBVIOUSLY.
Utahraptor: Look, if you're serious about this, then go buy some unincorporated land and build a road and house there! I think your street name's considered when the land is incorporated into a municipality.
T-Rex: But then I'd have to live out in the boonies all by myself!
T-Rex: On the other hand, I COULD be living on "Awesome People ONLY: The Street"! Frig! I can't see any way out of this impasse, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: You may want to go on about your day, I -
T-Rex (punchline): I may be stuck here like this for a while


T-Rex: Okay okay - so there's been a lot of people born, right? In the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born. So the question is, are there enough people that I could write a story...
T-Rex: ...and reasonably expect it to have already been LIVED OUT in real life?
T-Rex: Let's assume narratives can be reduced to yes/no decisions, and on average real people make a yes/no decision every 15 seconds. Two people are needed to cover each option for every decision! So after - um, 33 decisions, we've got more people needed than are alive right now, and we're only eight minutes into our story. It is a stories-in-real-life disaster!
T-Rex: BUT, if I wrote a story about the first eight minutes of a baby's life, ODDS ARE someone has lived it!
Utahraptor: Not really!
Utahraptor: You're assuming that for each decision, every person takes a separate route, but the vast majority of babies are doing the same thing: crying and then being confused.
T-Rex: I guess the odds of my writing a story and having it be what ACTUALLY HAPPENED to some dude are pretty low, huh.
God: SEE THIS IS WHAT I TOLD YOU T-REX JUST BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS SUPERMAN AND "JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET"
T-Rex (punchline): [small] i thought maybe it could be me


Off panel: Bro I tried to get with this woman but she totally put me in the friend zone!!
T-Rex: OH MAN!!
T-Rex: THE FRIEND ZONE SOUNDS LIKE A PLACE WITH LOTS OF HOT DOGS AND TRAMPOLINES
T-Rex: LET'S GO
T-Rex: I've got it, Dromiceiomimus! I get the guy I want to hang out with to take me to the FRIEND ZONE, and we're SET.
Dromiceiomimus: So you want to hit on him, get shot down, and then characterize things in such a way that the blame's on HIM for not wanting to date you??
T-Rex: Huh? No. No, I want to, like...
T-Rex: ...ride waterslides and drink pop with him??
T-Rex: Seriously, where is the Friend Zone? I'd like to go there RIGHT NOW please.
Utahraptor: You've never been?
T-Rex: Okay, obviously everyone ELSE has been having fun for years, doing activities with all the new pals they've been making thanks to the Friend Zone. Great! I JUST WANT TO JOIN THE PARTY. I know I must sound like every guy ever when I say this, but seriously:
T-Rex: WHY IS THE FRIEND ZONE SO HARD TO GET INTO??
T-Rex: I'm a nice guy!! I'm always there for people I like when they need me!
T-Rex (punchline): I DESERVE THIS


T-Rex: One day little Timmy got another wish from a genie. But we don't care about him anymore because his wish was that all social networks got turned into real live women!
T-Rex: Hah hah! Timmy, what the heck are you doing?!
T-Rex: In any case, it was a VERY exciting time. Twitter was a lunatic racist street corner harasser who sometimes said amazing things juuuuust often enough to keep you coming back! Facebook was a huge gossip who consistently lied about politics, took foreign money to influence domestic elections, AND smeared her critics as anti-Semitic! Also, she tracks everything you do and sells that information to the highest bidder.
Utahraptor: God, Facebook's the worst.
T-Rex: SHE REALLY IS.
T-Rex: Formspring, Orkut, and Google Buzz were all skeletons (because those networks are dead) and Google+ was a rich but obscure old lady who was scheduled to die on August 31st of next year.
Utahraptor: Poor Google+.
T-Rex: She died as she lived: extremely unpopularly.
Off panel (punchline): Well, one thing's for sure: I'M definitely never going to spend an average of 135 minutes a day hanging out with these awful people, perhaps via a dedicated app on my phone which lets me check in with them during every spare minute I havOH MY GOD


T-Rex: What's for dinner tonight, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well T-Rex, I don't know!
T-Rex: What would you like, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I always choose what's for dinner, T-Rex! You decide tonight.
Dromiceiomimus: ?
T-Rex: Hmm... in that case, T-Rex, let's have nachos tonight! It'll be fun!
Utahraptor: My friend, I'm afraid you've gone insane! You're coo-coo crazy!
T-Rex: Why's that?
Utahraptor: You're talking to yourself like you are two different people, and it is a societal norm that people who do that are insane.
T-Rex: Don't talk to me about societal norms! We walk around naked!
T-Rex (punchline): Observe!


T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving BEFORE it did in our timeline? You'd have computers made out of brass and steam! That sounds like it might be... AWESOME?
God: THAT GENRE IS CALLED STEAMPUNK T-REX
T-Rex: Okay whatever!
T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving AFTER it did in our timeline? You'd have no computers at all, and people riding around on horses saying "Gosh I wish we invented computers! Goooossssh!"
Dromiceiomimus: Arguably, that's what fantasy stories are, aren't they?
T-Rex: FINE.
T-Rex: What if you wrote a story about modern technology arriving at the usual time?
Utahraptor: Historical non-fiction!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm an idea man. Please give me an idea so that I can write an amazing story about it, okay?
Utahraptor: Easy! "Too many teens on the boat".
T-Rex: That's not an idea!
T-Rex: That is either a SONG TITLE or an ENTERTAINING CIRCUMSTANCE.
Narrator: LATER: TOO MANY TEENS ARE ON A BOAT:
T-Rex: Teens! We have reasonable capacity laws on seafaring vessels for a reason!!
T-Rex: AW FRIG
T-Rex (punchline): THAT IS A SENTENCE ONLY AN OLD MAN WOULD SAY


T-Rex: Alright everyone! Let's do our friggin' TAXES again, okay?
T-Rex: Let's do them every year until we die, okay?
T-Rex: And let's continue to pretend computers don't exist and that relying on PAPER RECEIPTS for proof of taxable expenses is a really awesome idea.
Dromiceiomimus: What's your alternative, a government keeps track of all your money and does your taxes for you?
T-Rex: I do recognize that's bad, but it's a FUTURE bad that must be weighed against the PRESENT bad of taxes being totally stupid and I hate them.
Utahraptor: Hi, my name's T-Rex and I'm complaining about taxes again! Surprised?
T-Rex: Oh, hello T-Rex!
T-Rex: My name's Utahraptor, and I'M gonna say something holier-than-thou soon about taxes being a privilege to pay as they allow society to function. I kinda like being WAY BETTER than everyone else, you know?
Utahraptor: No, actually - I wouldn't know.
T-Rex: ...Okay! I wanna be T-Rex again now!!
T-Rex (punchline): You're MESSING HIM UP


Narrator: HOW DO CITIES?
T-Rex: What?
T-Rex: How do cities what?
T-Rex: How do cities... get built? Thrive? Grow? Manage disparate community interests??
Dromiceiomimus: How do cities get food in 'em?
T-Rex: How do cities get so smelly, and how come too??
Utahraptor: Hello! How do [you do,] cities?
T-Rex: How do [you defeat the boss with the wizard sword,] cities?
T-Rex: Look, we should just admit it: we're in over our heads here. If someone ever asks us "how do cities" again we'll just reply with "Quite well thanks" and drop the mic and leave.
Utahraptor: We'll have to carry a mic with us at all times.
T-Rex: "Have to?" Dude. "GET to."
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, I am interested in purchasing drop-resistant microphones in bulk?
Off panel: Ah, sir is clearly a connoisseur of the emerging art of prop-based physical punctuation.
T-Rex (punchline): SIR WAS BORN FOR THIS, YO


T-Rex: It's the 50s! Sputnik has just orbited above the United States and peeps are FREAKING OUT. America wants to win the space race, and comes up with two options. OPTION ONE: create NASA, send men into space. Option 2:
T-Rex: NUKE THE FRIGGIN' MOON.
T-Rex: This plan has a lot of benefits! It's cheap, America already has the missiles and nukes lying around anyway, and a nuclear explosion on the moon WILL be visible from Earth. Plus it'd show those Reds who's boss!
Dromiceiomimus: "My fellow Americans: totally check out the moon tonight, but I can't tell you why because it's a surprise. Also, the hated Soviets should look too."
T-Rex: EXACTLY.
Utahraptor: So what happens next in your alternate history?
T-Rex: "Alternate"? What?
T-Rex: This happened, dude. Project A119. CARL SAGAN worked on it. It only got cancelled when they couldn't guarantee the nuke wouldn't miss and fall back to Earth, and they also got kinda worried that somehow - SOMEHOW - nuking the moon would not be the PR coup they'd hoped.
Utahraptor: The 20th century, huh?
Narrator: THE 20TH CENTURY, PERSONIFIED:
T-Rex: Hi, I represent the 20th century! In the space of almost 50 years we invented planes, TV, helicopters, digital computers, nukes AND spaceships!
T-Rex: So YEAH
T-Rex (punchline): WE WENT A LITTLE CRAZY


T-Rex: If the Eskimos have 500 words for snow, then surely we in our internet-stuff age should have 1000 words for "meh"!
God: T-REX THAT LINGUISTIC PREMISE IS ACTUALLY FULL OF LIES
T-Rex: *gasp*
God: YOU PULLED THAT NUMBER OUT OF THE AIR AND THERE'S NO ONE ESKIMO LANGUAGE BUT RATHER AN ESKIMO-ALEUT LANGUAGE FAMILY WHICH BUILDS COMPOUND NOUNS OUT OF WHAT YOU'D CALL A PHRASE
God: SO YOU SAY HARD ICY SNOW AND AN INUIT SPEAKER SAYS THE SAME THING ONLY JUST WITH FEWER SPACES
God: CALLING IT A UNIQUE WORD WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE WORD BOUNDARY ISSUES IS MISLEADING AT BEST
God: GAME SET AND MATCH BABY
T-Rex: Oooh look at me, I'm God, I know language stuff!
God: I KNOW ALL OF THE STUFFS
Utahraptor: Whoah!
Utahraptor: You're making fun of God? Is that not... THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME??
T-Rex: No, that's hunting dinosaurs. Well, I mean, folks used to say humans were the most dangerous game, but humans don't have claws.
Utahraptor: Check mine out! Rar.
T-Rex: I've got some good ones too! Snikt! They don't make that sound on their own so I have to say it out loud.
T-Rex (punchline): Sometimes life is full of compromises, you know?


Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS:
Narrator: what's the fastest you've ever travelled?
T-Rex: However fast a plane goes! 1000 million kilometers an hour??
Narrator: AFTER SOME BRIEF RESEARCH:
T-Rex: Okay, no, 925 km/h. Still pretty fast!
Dromiceiomimus: Did you sit still during the flight? If you walked in the direction of travel, that'd increase your speed even more.
T-Rex: Oh heck, I did! 925 km/h plus my average walking speed, babies!
Utahraptor: Well, the Earth itself is orbiting around the sun, so assuming you were travelling in the same direction...
T-Rex: Oh SNAP!
T-Rex: So that's, what, my 30 km per SECOND orbital speed plus aircraft speed plus my strollin' speed?
Utahraptor: Well, the sun itself is moving, in a galaxy that's moving, in a universe that may well be moving, so...
T-Rex: So I'm moving at speeds SO FAST and complicated they're BEYOND MEASURE?
Off panel: I mean, you don't want to say THAT, but -
T-Rex: WHOOOOOSH
Off panel: Plus, I'd caution you not to -
T-Rex: YES HELLO
T-Rex (punchline): I STAND BY MY EARLIER STATEMENT OF "WHOOOOOSH"


T-Rex: What's the sequence of sounds that sound intelligible in the most languages? Like if the sounds I make when I say "Hi there" in English meant "No thanks" in another language!
T-Rex: I WANT TO LEARN THESE PHRASES.
Dromiceiomimus: Why are they so important to you, bud?
T-Rex: Because then I can speak in multiple languages simultaneously! I could stand in front of a linguistically diverse group of people and speak to them all AT THE SAME TIME!!
T-Rex: That's awesome!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but you'd be saying different things to each of them.
T-Rex: EVEN BETTER.
T-Rex: It gives me DENIABILITY, Utahraptor. Look, all I'm saying is this: we need to direct our linguistic development so that the English sounds for "Hi please don't kick anyone, that's for darn sure" in some other language sound EXACTLY like "Definitely kick Justin Manitou right in the bottom, please".
T-Rex: Actually, that's not true!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm ALSO saying that, while we're at it, I DEFINITELY need to meet a Justin Manitou that I don't particularly care for


Narrator: HOW TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE FROM HISTORY
Narrator: 5 YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Hah hah, you jerks don't even know if the Higgs boson is real or not!
Narrator: 55 YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Hah hah, you losers don't have communication satellites, video games, cell phones, OR lasers, plus you haven't even sequenced a single DNA yet!
Dromiceiomimus: They also don't have the internet.
T-Rex: Oh yeah, that too!! Hah hah hah!
T-Rex: LOSERS
Narrator: 555 YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Hey, what are toilets that flush like?
Utahraptor: Oh wait, sorry, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.
Narrator: 5555 YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Hey, how's the writing coming? Oh sorry, I forgot you're still messing around with PROTOWRITING.
Utahraptor: Of which little can be said because we lost most of your documents!
T-Rex: Lost... or THREW AWAY, because turns out PROTOWRITING is PROTOBORING??
Narrator: 55,555 YEARS AGO:
T-Rex: Hey idiots!! Watch me blow your minds: FARMING, POTTERY, ROPE, and DOGS.
T-Rex: ...Listen, I'm sorry I called you guys idiots, you live with mammoths and sabre-tooth tigers; you got enough troubles already.
T-Rex (punchline): I'll show myself out, sorry again


T-Rex: "Goosie the Goosy Goose"
T-Rex: Goosie was the goosiest goose who ever lived!
T-Rex: That is to say, any trait that applied to geese applied to her most of all. She was the most goose it was possible to be.
Dromiceiomimus: So if geese are loud, Goosie was the loudest?
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: And if geese are intelligent, Goosie was the intelligentest?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: And if geese have an average egg length of 8.3cm, Goosie's eggs were EVEN BIGGER??
T-Rex: Uh - I guess so?
Utahraptor: And if geese weigh 7 kg, Goosie was an even greater mass of muscle and beak??
T-Rex: Y-Yes?
Off panel: Well! Goosie sounds less like a goose and more like a UTAHRAPTOR to me. Which IS, arguably, the greatest instantiation of the idea of "goose"??
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): You're not wrong


T-Rex: You know how in stories, whenever a character has the chance, he always decides that it's too dangerous to know too much about his own future?
T-Rex: Um, I would like to know too much, please!
T-Rex: Knowing who I marry, knowing where I end up living - all of these would be great timesavers!
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, but then you'd lose the joy of living your own life! There'd be no more surprises.
T-Rex: Okay, knowing just one thing, then. Going through life knowing that no matter what, I'm going to win the lottery, for example!
Utahraptor: Or, knowing that no matter what, you're NEVER going to win the lottery!
T-Rex: Also good!
T-Rex: I just want one little tidbit, you know?
Utahraptor: Okay - um, NO MATTER WHAT, one day you're going to... eat a whole pig?
T-Rex: Man, I coulda told you that! I accidentally almost ate a whole pig at breakfast, you know?
God: T-REX ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO PUNCH AN ATTACKING BEAR IN THE SOLAR PLEXUS AND THEN HE'LL BEND OVER IN PAIN AND THEN YOU'LL ELBOW HIM IN THE BACK
T-Rex: Oh my goodness!
T-Rex (punchline): My future! It's... it's so AWESOME...


T-Rex: Writing fiction certainly isn't hard. Not when you have tips!
God: FRIGGIN' TIPS
T-Rex: Right. Not when you have friggin' tips!
Narrator: WRITING TIPS COMICS
T-Rex: Sometimes it can be hard to name characters. Here's a tip: name them after other, more famous characters, and add in some Roman numerals! If you want to show that a character is tough, name him Genghis II. If your character is this big lover guy who has fallen for, um, a 14-year-old, call him "Romeo IV"! Hey presto! Suddenly your characters write themselves!
Utahraptor: "Genghis II punched Romeo IV on the nose." doesn't sound like good drama!
T-Rex: Are you kidding?
T-Rex: ATTENTION, EVERYONE! Genghis II punched Romeo IV on the nose!
Multiple off-panel voices: Wow!
Off panel: I really want to hear more!!
Utahraptor: Man, passers by always take your side! It's ridiculous!
Utahraptor: Listen, I'll talk to you later.
Multiple off-panel voices: So what happens next, mysterious stranger? We still really want to hear more!
T-Rex: Um... Genghis II and Romeo IV decide... to take you all to the fair!
Off panel: Yay!
Off panel: Yaaaay!
Off panel (punchline): [small] but i've already been to the fair


T-Rex: Maybe there IS actually a personal benefit to being mortal and dying one day.
T-Rex: I know, IT SOUNDS CRAZY, but stay with me!
T-Rex: We mortal people get an end to pain that immortal dudes never get. Unlike immortal dudes, there's a finite number of times I'm going to stub my toe so hard that it breaks. One time I'll stub my toe and it'll break and I'll be able to say, "There, that's done with. I'm never stubbing my toe THAT friggin' hard again. I can finally put this TOTALLY RIDICULOUS aspect of being alive behind me." - even if I could never know it at the time!
Utahraptor: One time when you say it, you'll have to be right!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: So now when something bad happens, I'll assume I'll die soon, so it's the last time it'll ever happen to me. I'll be able to sigh and just let it go.
Utahraptor: "That's the last time I'm puking into my crotch"?
T-Rex: Exactly! I'm not stubbing THESE toes any more!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: FRIG I STUBBED MY TOES AGAIN!
T-Rex: WHAT
T-Rex: IS
T-Rex: THE
T-Rex: DEAL
T-Rex: WITH
T-Rex (punchline): STUBBED TOES THAT HURT REALLY BAD


T-Rex: What day is it? Friday? It must be Friday because it's time for more...
Narrator: SECRETS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
T-Rex: So what you do is tap someone on the head, between the eyes and above the nose! They'll reflexively blink each time you tap them until they get wise to your game, at which point they'll suppress the reflex and the blinking will stop. But until then, THEIR EYELIDS ARE AT YOUR MERCY. YOU CONTROL SOMEONE ELSE'S EYELIDS WITH YOUR MEREST WHIM.
Dromiceiomimus: Neat, I guess!
T-Rex: Pretty neat I guess, yeah!
Utahraptor: So your secret is tap someone on the head and they'll blink? You must be fun at parties.
T-Rex: That's only part of it!
T-Rex: The other part is if they CONTINUE to blink after the first few taps, then that's one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Utahraptor: Holy crap!
T-Rex: But it's not NECESSARILY Parkinson's. It could also be dementia! Or any number of progressive neurological illnesses, really.
Narrator: THIS PANEL INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
Narrator (punchline): ON ACCOUNT OF HOW YOU ARE CURRENTLY TAPPING YOUR FACE


T-Rex: I submit that there are a finite number of songs! Therefore, the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility.
T-Rex: Consider the following!
T-Rex: There are effective limits on what constitutes music. If we take a week as a very generous upper-bound on the length of one song, then we have a temporal limit. Furthermore, since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones, we do not have a continuum of notes, but rather, a finite set. Therefore, there are only so many songs that can be written!
Utahraptor: I am forced to disagree with you, my friend!
T-Rex: Surely not!
Utahraptor: I think that you're omitting many dimensions of song. What about the way it's played, the lyrics? These too can be varied almost indefinitely.
T-Rex: Almost, but there are still effective limits, therefore: finite number of songs!
Narrator: SHOCK ENDING:
T-Rex (punchline): Or are there?


T-Rex: Polysyndeton is when you use a lot of conjunctions and you chain phrases together and you go and you go and you don't stop until you have used polysyndeton!
Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique
Narrator: POLYSYNDETON
T-Rex: You can use it for rhythm or you can use it for cadence or you can use it in case commas are expensive but there is a big ol' sale on conjunctions! It can also make your writing appear childlike and if that is the sort of thing you're into then this is a good way of doing that.
Utahraptor: There's really not much to it, huh?
T-Rex: It's pretty straightforward!
T-Rex: BASICALLY, any place you'd use a comma, write "and" and/or "but" and/or "anyway whatever" instead. For example, "It was the best of times but anyway whatever it was the worst of times." Isn't that better?
Utahraptor: Um
T-Rex: ISN'T THAT BETTER??
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: Hey Shakespeare! Mess up your plays with some polysyndeton!!
Off panel: t-rex don't you have other things to do
T-Rex: Besides travel back in time to hang out with my friends?
T-Rex (punchline): Nooooooope


T-Rex: One day Danny Dollface was sent back in time! You are probably noticing how objectively awesome Danny Dollface's name is - and you are correct!!
T-Rex: But that's not the point of this story!
T-Rex: "Dollface," Danny said to himself, "you've arrived back in 1990, before the internet was really cool and good. You can re-invent the sites you remember, only now YOU'LL be the one making all the money from them!" So Danny got to work, and soon he was like "here's Facebook, for I have invented social media"!
Utahraptor: But with 90s-era tech it couldn't scale and was really slow and sucked?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: So it failed, but prevented the invention of Actual Facebook, which was nice. And because his name was "DollFACE", it made sense he'd still name his knockoff "Facebook"! That is the kind of rad worldbuilding you only get with me, a guy who walks around summarizing his stories out loud!
Utahraptor: For free?
T-Rex: NOPE.
T-Rex (punchline): ...This is me holding out my hand for money, friend


God: HEY T-REX YOU SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SOON
T-Rex: I'm going to ignore the symbolism of this!
Narrator: T-REX IN: THE MALL
Narrator: THAT EVENING:
T-Rex: ARGH! I had hoped to avoid this realization, but it's inescapable: I hate the mall! I know it's a clichéd thing to hate but it's TRUE. I hate the crowds and the cell phones and I hate the music and the consumerism and the shops that don't have anything that I want. And I didn't hate but I really disliked the burger I purchased in the food court. It had no toppings. Also it was very dry.
Utahraptor: You're becoming a generic stand-up comedian!
T-Rex: I'm not! I just feel their pain!
T-Rex: And YES, I understand that of all the things in the world to get worked up about, maybe poverty and climate change are above one soul-crushing shopping experience downtown. But man! The mall!
Utahraptor: Hah, if you felt as serious about climate change as you do about the mall, we'd have that settled in no time!
Narrator: T-REX TRIES TO GET AS WORKED UP ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO THE MALL:
T-Rex: Everyone! Support the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol!
T-Rex (punchline): ALSO SCREW THE MALL IN ITS STUPID FACE OKAY


T-Rex: Hello! Do you want to find someone to commit to and share THE ENTIRE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH? Because you don't have to! You can just have fun sex with each other and that's it!
T-Rex: We invented that!
T-Rex: We call it "casual sex"!
T-Rex: ...Still here? You heard what I said about casual sex, right? And yet you're not out looking for casual sex partners RIGHT NOW? Hmm. Maybe I didn't explain it right. Okay.
T-Rex: You know how at the office when there's casual Fridays, and you look forward to it all week? What if it was casual Friday every day? And rather than going into work, you straight-up had cool sex instead??
Utahraptor: Why, I'd be fired!
T-Rex: It's a metaphor!
T-Rex: Or an analogy. It's that thing where I compare two things to make you agree with me, you know?
Utahraptor: Analogy.
T-Rex: But there's metaphorical elements to it. Is there, like, a special name for that kind of analogy?
God: T-REX YOU HAVE TURNED A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEX INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT LITERARY TECHNIQUES
T-Rex: Obvs! That's how come I get so much casual sex!!
God: I MEAN
God (punchline): I'M NOT SURPRISED


T-Rex: IN THE FUTURE, travel will involve climbing inside MULTI-TON METAL ROBOTS, who will dutifully carry us to our destination!!
T-Rex: But these robots will be cars instead of building-sized colossuses, due to economics being dumb!!
T-Rex: EVEN SO, it's still going to be rad. And you know why, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: Because after over a century of phoning it in, the "auto-mobile" will finally live up to the promise of its name??
T-Rex: YES. Also, we'll be able to play in traffic with IMPUNITY.
Utahraptor: That's something we want to do?
T-Rex: Um, ABSOLUTELY?
T-Rex: Dude, when we can do that safely, it means cars are FINALLY no longer mindless machines ready and willing to kill anyone in their path "by accident", but now COURTEOUS ROBOT PALS with 360° situational awareness and constant predictive processing. And that means street hockey is coming back, baby!
T-Rex (punchline): In other news: YES I want to live inside a robot car, and that is NORMAL


T-Rex: Assuming aphorisms are 100% accurate, NOBODY is going to shoot ME to death!
T-Rex: That's because I own a bullet with my name on it, ladies!!
God: WHAT IF YOU DON'T DIE FROM BULLET OVERDOSE THOUGH
T-Rex: *gasp*
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Okay okay! Things with my name on them I now own include: a bullet, a salad, a flight of stairs, a blender, my dog because I taped it to him, a DVD, a CD, a cassette, a record, a wax cylinder, a computer, a bear if that guy on the computer is to be believed, an instance of every article of clothing I own, AND baking powder.
T-Rex: I should be safe - for a while?
Utahraptor: That's nowhere near to one of every noun! What about butts?
T-Rex: I need a butt with my name on it; I admit it freely!
Utahraptor: Dude, even if you DO buy one of everything on the planet and write your name on it -
T-Rex: - an enviable lifestyle -
Utahraptor: - there's still stuff you can't buy! The sun could explode, ASTEROIDS COULD HIT, and so on!
T-Rex: Hah! "Asteroids."
T-Rex: Whatever, space!!

Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator (punchline): DRAMATIC IRONY


T-Rex: Worried about a date you're going on? Lick a dog poop! You'll have bigger things to worry about, like "holy crap why did I lick a dog poop just before my date??"
T-Rex: Problems with the tax man? Try licking a dog poop!
T-Rex: There's no problem that couldn't be made worse by licking a dog poop, which means that minor problems will disappear like a candle on the surface of the sun!!
T-Rex: (The candle is your existing problems, and the blinding light of the solar furnace is the problems you made by licking dog poops on the regular.)
Dromiceiomimus: Ah.
Utahraptor: But this doesn't solve anything. It just creates WORSE problems!
T-Rex: Sure!
T-Rex: Way worse problems... that can EASILY BE SOLVED by not lickin' poops no more. OH DAMN, NOW YOUR OLD PROBLEMS SEEM SMALL AND EASILY SOLVED!!
T-Rex: YOU'RE WELCOME!
T-Rex's head: *pop*
T-Rex (punchline): Ah yes, the distinctive "pop" sound of enlightenment, I know it well


T-Rex: I demand instant gratification!
Narrator: SECONDS LATER...
T-Rex: I'm not gratified!
T-Rex: Maybe instant gratification isn't-
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! How long have you been standing there?!
Dromiceiomimus: Long enough!
Narrator: POSTSCRIPT: THE NEXT DAY
Utahraptor: I'm T-Rex and I demand instant gratification!
T-Rex: Those were my private thoughts! She had no right to tell you!
Utahraptor: Hah hah hah! It's good gossip!
T-Rex: Ha ha, I guess I was being kind of silly!
T-Rex (punchline): Listen though, don't tell my mom, okay?


T-Rex: Gosh but it's sometimes hard to know what the right thing to do is! If only there were a series of rules to tell me what to do in every situation!
Narrator: DEONTOLOGY COMIX
T-Rex: Deontology, Dromiceiomimus! It's where you follow rules to act ethically.
Dromiceiomimus: So like, "Thou shalt not kill?"
T-Rex: Exactly! Once I have the rules chosen, I no longer have to worry if a given act is ethical or not, I just have to make sure it follows the rules! This leaves me free to think about other stuff, like how cute would it be if cats and dogs had puppens?
T-Rex: Maybe they'd be called kuppies??
Utahraptor: So thou is totally not going to kill, right?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: Okay, here's one dude who's going to go back in time and stop the Big Bang from exploding, and he's not going to kill a thousand dudes. He's going to kill ALL LIFE THAT HAS OR EVER WILL BE. The only way to stop him is to kill him. If you keep with your rule and let him go, everybody dies! T-REX, YOU ARE A MONSTER.
T-Rex: Oh, no bigs, I have another rule that says it's okay to kill if I really want to. More precisely, it says "harm may be done if it's an effect of a greater good"!
T-Rex (punchline): But come on, if you want to mess with the Big Bang I'ma shoot you in the head!!


T-Rex: You and your friends stand in a field, alone, too far away to really talk to each other. You wait there while someone else's friends line up and take turns hitting balls at you. And it's not like they're soft. They're really hard.
T-Rex: You can catch them if you want.
Narrator: BASEBALL
Narrator: AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: If you catch the ball, then they don't get a point, nothing changes, and we've all been wasting our time. If you DON'T catch the ball, then they get to run in a big circle and get some points based on how much of a circle they ran in.
T-Rex: A full circle is worth a whopping one point! Oh. Also, no fractional points are awarded.
T-Rex: Have fun, you guys!
Utahraptor: This doesn't sound like a very interesting game!
T-Rex: Hah! Oh, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Baseball isn't played because it's INTERESTING. Baseball is played because without darkness we would not appreciate the light: without sorrow, we would not appreciate joy. Baseball makes us savour life and reminds us to treasure every second we have on this beautiful planet, because such moments may never come again.
T-Rex: Baseball is played, my dear friend, because without it we would not appreciate the times when we don't have to play baseball.
Narrator (punchline): THE END


T-Rex: It's always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did. Why weren't people rapping until only a few decades ago? Did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop, and then not stop?
T-Rex: Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered... viable?
T-Rex: It's the same thing with any genre and medium, really! How come nobody thought of science fiction until Verne wrote "Forsooth, diary! To-day I am going to invente scientifical fictionne!"? I want to listen to Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331, and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it. Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes?
Utahraptor: You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.
T-Rex: But you get the idea!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it's not that big a step from that to rap. I'm sure there were people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:
T-Rex: Alright, this is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and uh, try to keep up.
T-Rex: "I said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie to the hip hip hop, and you don't stop!"
T-Rex (punchline): Mozart!! I SAID to watch me for the changes and try to keep up!


T-Rex: We'd all be a heck of a lot more productive if work was as entertaining as - you know, entertainment! In particular, I'D be a lot better off if learning accounting was as relentlessly entertaining as learning, I don't know...
T-Rex: ...about the sexual histories of my friends and acquaintances, PERHAPS??
T-Rex: Heck, if being a responsible and productive member of the community was as entertaining as turning on the TV and seeing Batman punch someone in the junk, I'd be all over that!
Dromiceiomimus: Over what? Batman punching or being a good member of society?
T-Rex: Both at the same time, Dromiceiomimus!!
Utahraptor: I suppose you're proposing we somehow make "work" more entertaining?
T-Rex: Actually, no!
T-Rex: Such an approach is doomed to failure from its very start. Don't you think generations of parents have tried this? Despite their best efforts, cleaning a room is never as fun as making it messy again. And when we grow up, digging a ditch is not as fun as - I don't know, the opposite of digging a ditch.
T-Rex: Digging a ditch is never as fun as piling things into a small ridge by the side of the road.
Narrator (punchline): THE END


Narrator: HOW TO BE A MEDICAL DOCTOR
Narrator: part six in our "you CAN TOO learn this from a webcomic" series
T-Rex: Medical science is the science of making bodies less terrible!
T-Rex: And people who practise medical science are called "medical doctors". If you want to be a doctor you'll need to learn everything that can go wrong with a body!
T-Rex: *sigh*
T-Rex: So much can go wrong with a body
Utahraptor: You've got only a few seconds left to cover all of the medical sciences!
T-Rex: I got this, I got this!
T-Rex: Okay so first off, each body should have at least one circulatory system, respiratory system, reproductive system, lym--
Utahraptor: We're out of time!
T-Rex: Frig it. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE ALL DOCTORS!!
[a certificate in a gothic font]
Certificate: This Comic Certifies [blank] is a real doctor
Certificate (punchline): Let it hereby be known that all actual medical degrees have a dinosaur on them, and if your doctor's doesn't then my question is, um, what the hell is their deal


T-Rex: Sometimes when you're in an accident or about to be hurt, time seems to slow down! This gives you more of a chance to react to ensure your survival!
T-Rex: THIS IS AWESOME.
T-Rex: Assuming that time isn't ACTUALLY changing, this means that my brain has the incredible ability to slow down my perception of time! I must harness this, Dromiceiomimus! I could become TRULY UNSTOPPABLE. I could read books faster AND also do well on timed tests!
Dromiceiomimus: It does sound like it would be an evolutionary advantage.
T-Rex: I am seriously trying to evolve so hard over here!
Utahraptor: But wouldn't it be boring?
T-Rex: Nope!
Utahraptor: Sure it would! If you're all "I perceive the world slowly, allowing me more reaction time", wouldn't this conversation be slowed down? Wouldn't everyone look like statues and sound like dull rumbles when they open their mouths?
T-Rex: THERE IS ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
Narrator: T-REX INCREDIBLY GAINS THIS POWER FOR ONE DAY ONLY! IT'S SO PLAUSIBLE
T-Rex: [thinks] I'm trapped in a body that moves so slowly as to seem motionless. Ah well! At least I have plenty of time to think about... mammalian breasts?
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Self, what is the deal with mammalian breasts?


Narrator: EPISTEMOLOGY COMICS
T-Rex: If I say "Guys, I know I'm rad", what am I saying? What does it actually mean to KNOW something? Philosophers have struggled with this for ages!
T-Rex: Luckily the answer is super easy and they should have come up with it sooner!
T-Rex: Knowledge of anything, radness included, comes about if three conditions are met: that this thing is true, that I believe it to be true, and that I have a JUSTIFIED cause for this belief! Perhaps my justification of radness is that I've been shot out of a cannon onto a motorbike, which is extremely rad. When these three conditions are met, then I've got what's called a Justified True Belief, and that, my friends, is what knowledge is!
Utahraptor: Okay, so we're hanging out, and I say "T-Rex, I'm gonna go nap in your bed."
T-Rex: I say, "Dude, feel free!"
Utahraptor: However, once in your room I startle a sleepy murderer, who without alarming you, quietly murders me, stuffs me in the closet, and then goes back to nappy times - in your bed!! A few minutes later you say "Nice. An orange dude is sleeping in my bed". Clearly, this is justified, and it may even be true.
Off panel: But only if the murderer was orange! Don't you see? It's sheer luck that this murderer was coloured to make your belief true. Are you really going to call random chance "knowledge"?
T-Rex: Utahraptor!!
T-Rex (punchline): Please don't get murdered in my bedroom, Utahraptor


T-Rex: If my parents had named me "Lord Britishface the Third", would I be a different person?
T-Rex: The answer is "I say, most certainly!"
T-Rex: A name sets up EXPECTATIONS. "T-Rex" says, "This awesome dude will probably be a great friend!" But Lord Britishface III says "Here is a man who will wear a monocle in his old age; surprise him, it may pop out comedically. He takes his tea by the Hamptonshire while reminiscing of the summers of his youth." And these expectations are set up not only in others, but in the child himself!
Utahraptor: I agree such a name might colour a child's life!
T-Rex: Excellent. Then it's settled!
Utahraptor: But I also know that you can't legally choose a name with military titles or other honourifics in it. The government won't accept it!
T-Rex: Man, whatever! I'll just legally name my kid "T-Rex Jr." and then refer to him exclusively as "Lord Britishface the Third"!
T-Rex: What's the government going to do? ARREST ME?
T-Rex: I'd really like to see them try!
T-Rex (punchline): ...to ignore my provocation and leave me alone, that is!


T-Rex: You know what's super important? FEELINGS. Especially other people's feelings which are not boring at all. Yes, that is most definitely a fact. We should all be concerned about them.
Narrator: HOW TO BLUFF YOUR WAY THROUGH EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT FEELINGS
T-Rex: Okay! So first off, start every sentence with "I understand where you're coming from" and then say the person's name. That'll get you 80% there!
Dromiceiomimus: This is kind of insulting, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I understand where you're coming from, Dromiceiomimus, but with respect, you need to let me finish.
Dromiceiomimus: Daaang, that WAS pretty good!
Utahraptor: Okay, so what if I said I wanted to break up?
T-Rex: Are we dating?
Utahraptor: For the purposes of this experiment, yes. We are rhetorical sweeties!
T-Rex: Okay, well: I understand where you're coming from, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: ...Yes?
Utahraptor: Go on!
T-Rex: That's it! I understand where you're coming from SO DANG HARD that I think we should break up too!!
T-Rex (punchline): Look bro, this fake rhetorical relationship has meant like, nothing to me


T-Rex: [stops dreaming]
T-Rex: Holy crap!
T-Rex: THAT WAS.
T-Rex: THE CRAZIEST.
T-Rex: DREAM YOU GUYS.
T-Rex: There were hot dates AND weddings AND makeouts! And tiny elephants and tiny bugs and long before that some racoonocephalopods and I think a talking bottle of vanilla extract was in there somewhere and the craziest thing was, everyone called me "T-Rex"! Isn't that crazy?
Dromiceiomimus: It is PRETTY CRAZY, Antonio Xavier Kavalier III!
T-Rex: It felt long too, like maybe I'd been dreaming for... SEVEN YEARS??
Utahraptor: Seven years of dreams?!
T-Rex: It really felt that long, Doctor Professor Jim Junior!
Utahraptor: Then don't go back to sleep! You could easily have another dream that lasts that long - maybe even longer!
T-Rex: Man, that's crazy and I LOVE HAVING DREAMS. I'm going to have one right now!!
T-Rex: Besides, we all have stupid names here anyway
T-Rex (punchline): [starts dreaming]


Off panel: Let's discuss your holes, T-Rex.
[no text]
T-Rex: Okay, you know what? YES. Let's discuss my holes! My body has many holes, including my earholes, which allow soundwaves to be entered and processed. I've got noseholes for smell, a mouthhole for food, and let's not forget my cloaca, my super-hot shared reproductive, intestinal, and urinary opening!!
Dromiceiomimus: ONE-STOP SHOPPING, BAYBEE.
Utahraptor: Not to mention your pores!
T-Rex: Yes! Lots of holes there!
T-Rex: Plus if you get to the subatomic level, my atoms are mostly empty space anyway, so really what are we but walking collections of holes at various convenient scales?
Utahraptor: I'm convenient holes all the way down, T-Rex.
T-Rex: YEP, THANKS.
Narrator: EARLIER:
Off panel: Let's discuss your holes, T-Rex.
T-Rex: AHHHHHH
T-Rex: ASK ME AGAIN IN A MONTH AND I'LL BE SO READY
Off panel (punchline): Okay, cool


T-Rex: [thinks] OMG YOU NEED TO GET A TATTOO
T-Rex: OMG, I need to get a tattoo!
T-Rex: Okay, here's what I'm thinking: a dog bone that says "dogs" inside of it, OR a dog bone that says "dogs" inside of it in Times New Roman, OR - and this one is my favourite - a dog bone that says "dogs" inside of it in an awesome 80s computer font.
T-Rex: ...Big into dogs over here.
Utahraptor: Got anything that's not about dogs?
T-Rex: No, I'm afraid that doesn't interest me!
Utahraptor: Really? No interest for a tattoo of a robot with cool pecs? Or a tattoo of a burger surrounded by a banner that reads "I KINDA LIKE EATING THESE"? Or a chest tattoo that says "IF YOU CAN READ THIS THEN WOW, I GUESS I TOOK MY SHIRT OFF"?
T-Rex: STOP YOU ARE BREAKING MY MIND WITH THESE AWESOME IDEAS
Off panel: A tattoo on your butt that folds in when you clench to reveal the message "FLEX TO MEET YOU"?
T-Rex's head: *crack*
T-Rex: !!
T-Rex (punchline): Oh man, now you've done it


Narrator: FORK FACTS
Narrator: now with executive summary!
T-Rex: We eat many meals with forks today because we're like, "wow, this is way easier than getting spaghetti sauce all over my hands, face, clothing, and/or naked chest"!
T-Rex: We were, sadly, not ALWAYS so smart!
T-Rex: Personal "I'ma eat my food with this" forks showed up around the 4th century in Byzantine Empire, which was very exciting for people who liked clean hands. Then it took us literally FIVE HUNDRED YEARS for them to catch on in the Middle East, and another hundred or so until they arrived in Italy. In 11th century Italy, forks were a big forkin' deal!
Utahraptor: You HAD to go for the "forkin'" pun.
T-Rex: I... forkgot not to??
T-Rex: But here's the crazy part: forks still took HUNDREDS of years to reach Europe. They made sense in Italy because of pasta, but the rest of Europe was like "wow, forks are for stupid babies", due to their Italian Racisms! So they just DID WITHOUT.
Utahraptor: Friggin' Europe.
T-Rex: Right?!
Narrator: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Narrator: - forks: good thing to eat a food with
Narrator: - you CAN eat spaghetti naked
Narrator: - Europe: racisms??
Narrator (punchline): - forks not actually recommended for stupid babies


Narrator: "EUPHEMISMS" FOR DATING
T-Rex: Yes! Maybe sometimes you don't want to throw the fact that you've found happiness in the arms of another in my face? Maybe you need some "euphemisms".
T-Rex: For example!
T-Rex: Instead of saying "Sally and I are now dating exclusively" you can say "Sally and I are now seeing other people ONLY WITH REGRET." On second thought, maybe you should keep the "Sally and I are now dating exclusively" because if I don't want to acknowledge your commitment, I can play dumb and say, "Sally and you are now dating exclusively... axe murderers? Mad scientists? Um, DOGS?"
Utahraptor: So, hey, your euphemisms are pretty weak so far!
T-Rex: Yes. Allow me to correct that!
T-Rex: Instead of "T-Rex, we're dating": "T-Rex, we're eating an awful lot of picnics on Sundays", "T-Rex, we're hanging out more than can be politely explained away", "T-Rex, we're playing Mega Man in two-player mode".
Utahraptor: Mega Man doesn't have a two-player mode.
T-Rex: Not for us, Utahraptor! Not for us.
T-Rex (punchline): *sigh*


T-Rex: Go to a wedding and you're liable to hear classical music! Go to a funeral, what do you hear?
T-Rex: Heck, it's probably classical music that's supposed to give you the sad feelings!
T-Rex: Even GRADUATIONS normally have some classical music in 'em. All these major life events have classical soundtracks, and you know why?
Dromiceiomimus: Because it's classy?
T-Rex: Because it's really old! Exactly!
T-Rex: At the time they were pop songs, but now they're Ultra Class!
Utahraptor: Your point, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh, just that hundreds of years from now they might be playing our Top 40 Dance Megahits at funerals because of how classy they sound to their modern ears!
Utahraptor: Hah! Wow, that'd be awful. Well, at least we won't be around to see it, huh?
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex (punchline): Wait what


T-Rex: Hey, I wonder if I got any emails while I was out?
T-Rex: Oh boy! Emails!
Narrator: BACK AT HOME:
T-Rex: What? No emails?!
Narrator: SHORTLY...
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, how come you never send me any emails?
Dromiceiomimus: I see you in person often enough! What do you want emails for?
T-Rex: I want emails!
Utahraptor: You'd get more emails if you sent more out!
T-Rex: But I already do!
T-Rex: I sent you four surveys AND an email where if I forwarded it, some charity would get 3 cents AND a list I found of reasons why T-Rexes are better than Utahraptors (green is the new black!)
Utahraptor: Man, I don't need that sort of stuff in my mailbox! I meant REAL emails.
T-Rex: Do you mean to imply that T-Rexes are not better than Utahraptors?
T-Rex (punchline): Because if so, I would advise you to check your email!


T-Rex: It's safe to eat chalk, right? Probably?
T-Rex: Probably it's safe to eat chalk?
T-Rex: Let us totally assume that it's safe to eat chalk!!
T-Rex: And seriously, if it's not safe to eat chalk then it's DEFINITELY safe to eat sawdust. And even if it's not, there's got to be things that'll pass through you ENTIRELY UNDIGESTED but that also won't cause any harm when you gobble them!
T-Rex: Guys! We should be making food out of these things!
Utahraptor: Another weight-loss scheme?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, this one's perfect though!
T-Rex: You'll be able to eat ALL YOU WANT and get that great "I'm so full, you guys" feeling, but never gain any weight!
Utahraptor: Ah, yes, that coveted "I'm so full of chalk and sawdust, you guys" feeling.
T-Rex: Don't knock it 'til you've tried it!
Narrator: T-REX TRIES IT:
T-Rex (punchline): bleh


T-Rex: Oh man, I haven't bought anyone any presents yet! I AM SO POOCHED! I am the worst friend in the world.
T-Rex: This will consummate my social ruin FOR SURE!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Oh, hey, Dromiceiomimus! How's - how are things?
Dromiceiomimus: Things are alright, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Haha, that's cool! Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow: Christmas Eve! I have a very special present for YOU, my friend.
Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah, sure thing! Thanks!
T-Rex: Why did I say that?? I AM EVEN MORE POOCHED THAN EVER BEFORE.
Utahraptor: No presents, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Nope! And then I compounded it by telling Dromiceiomimus that I had something extra special for her. And OH MAN, now you know my secret. I'm out of control!
Utahraptor: It's okay! We'll be your friends even without presents.
T-Rex: I know I know but still!
Narrator: LATER: A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE??
T-Rex: Hey!!
T-Rex (punchline): I could give Dromiceiomimus my toaster!


Narrator: T-REX HAS WRITTEN A NEW STORY!
T-Rex: Yes! It's about a guy named "Clarke Kente"! His name is CLOSE to Superman's secret identity, but legally and creatively distinct.
T-Rex: And then in my story Clarke's looking for a girlfriend!
T-Rex: And then he meets a woman named "Louise Laan" and then they're dating and there's some smooching and romance and it all ends in marriage. The end!
Dromiceiomimus: What? That's it? That's the story?
T-Rex: It's a good story! It's heartwarming and the theme is that, SOMETIMES, people can fall in love. Aww! Everyone loves to be reminded of that!
Utahraptor: So do Superman comics exist in this story?
T-Rex: Nope! Nobody knows about Superman.
Utahraptor: Ah, so you use the characters to finally give Clark Kent the quiet and stable relationship with Lois he could never have as Superman.
T-Rex: No, that would be good, but that's not my story. MY story is a simple love tale about simple people, with names that are legally and creatively distinct.
Narrator: LATER: PHONE CALLS!
T-Rex: DC Comics, quit hasslin' me! Clarke and Louise AND Bruce Swaine are my own characters!
Off panel: Um, I'm just a telemarketer who wants to sell you some long distance?
T-Rex (punchline): Listen, if we both pretend we can both get what we want out of this conversation, okay?


T-Rex: It's the future! And all media is now owned by a single company!! This has a lot of downsides...
T-Rex: ...but it DOES allow the most ambitious crossover of all time!!
T-Rex: That's right! Now you can find out what happens when PRINCESS LEIA meets WHOEVER YOU LIKE FROM GAME OF THRONES (I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET)!! What sparks will fly when DOCTOR ROBOTNIK teams up with EVERY CHARACTER EVER PLAYED BY MICHAEL J. FOX to solve crimes??
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex... what if I told you this future was available now, without the dystopia of a single corporation owning all culture?
T-Rex: I'd scoff! SCOFF!!
Utahraptor: Well, you can read it in fan fiction!
T-Rex: That's ILLEGAL!
Utahraptor: Oh please. It's not, but even if it were... I can think of nothing more badass than reading ILLEGAL FICTION, of hiding BANNED BOOKS from the BOOK POLICE.
T-Rex: Dang man, you're right! Fan fiction, here I come!!
Narrator: BUT THEN:
T-Rex: Michael J. Fox does WAY too much kissing on his alternate universe selves in this for MY puritan tastes!!
Off panel: T-Rex, you can read a story WITHOUT kissing in it.
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): The very IDEA


Narrator: WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PART OF BEING ALIVE?
T-Rex: My favorite part is the food!
T-Rex: AND ALSO THE KISSING
Dromiceiomimus: Mine's solving puzzles: that moment of insight when everything seems possible. I love it!
T-Rex: Hmm, yes, that's definitely something I too regularly experience, as a fellow smart person.
T-Rex: It's truly, uh...
T-Rex: ...good.
T-Rex: [small] and cool
Utahraptor: I like the senses!
T-Rex: All of them? Even the duds?
Utahraptor: Yep!
Utahraptor: You put something in front of me and I can see it, touch it, TASTE it, smell it - I'm like this walking talking chemical testing facility, only instead of experiencing information as NUMBERS and DATA, I experience it innately, as colour and sound and taste and everything else. It's kinda bonkers.
God: MINE'S THE EXTRA SPIDER-BASED SENSES I GAVE MYSELF, LIKE THE TINGLING SENSATION I GET WHENEVER DANGER IS NEARBY
T-Rex: Oh my god
God: YES
God (punchline): SPEAKING
