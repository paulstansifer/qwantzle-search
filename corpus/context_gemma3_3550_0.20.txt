God: T-REX ISN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY COMING UP SOON
T-Rex: It is!
God: AND ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THE CELEBRATION
T-Rex: I am!
God: AND HAVE YOU ACHIEVED YOUR LIFE-LONG GOAL OF BECOMING IMMORTAL YET
T-Rex: I -
T-Rex: Oh yeah.
T-Rex: Okay guys: I've seriously got to become immortal, STAT.
Utahraptor: Why not just enjoy the time you've got?
Utahraptor: There's been tons of folks in every previous generation who wanted to be immortal, and I don't see any of them still kicking around.
T-Rex: Aha, but were THEY motivated by an acute awareness of their failures and compromises, brought on by the anniversary of my birth??
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: I'm still not immortal, but I HAVE managed to recontextualize birthday cakes into second-place consolation prizes for failing to achieve immortality! Now all birthday parties are super depressing.
T-Rex (punchline): ...Go me?


God: T-REX HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR GENERATION
T-Rex: Born too late for tall ships, but too soon for star ships!
God: WOW
God: OUCH
T-Rex: I know it, dude!
God: THERE'S GOT TO BE A LESS DEPRESSING WAY TO DESCRIBE YOURSELVES
T-Rex: Born too soon to have our consciousness survive indefinitely in a robot body, but born just late enough that we can all TOTALLY see the option coming?
T-Rex: Yaaaaay mortality??
Utahraptor: Born too late for naming mountains, but just right for naming planets!
T-Rex: NICE.
T-Rex: Yet I can't help but notice we were born too late for chamberpots, but too soon to just have it beamed out of our bodies. Into a giant pile. That we then beam onto our enemies' heads.
Utahraptor: But then our enemies would retaliate in kind!
T-Rex: Oh man! GROSS!
T-Rex: I guess we'd have to declare a truce, and then we're back where we started.
Off panel: Until they figure out inside body to inside body poop beaming.
T-Rex: EWWWWWWWWWW!!
T-Rex (punchline): Frig, let's just die now and get it over with, am I right?


T-Rex: Man, what a jerky guy! I met the jerkiest guy working at the computer store.
Narrator: T-REX AND THE REALLY JERKY GUY
Narrator: A STORY OF "THE HUMAN CONDITION"
Dromiceiomimus: What made him so jerky, T-Rex? His haircut?
T-Rex: Worse than that. He was just so smug about everything! I wanted to buy some RAM, so that my computer could think harder about things? But he had this air of - disdain, I guess, that went far beyond "aloof store clerk" to "terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive." I bought the RAM but now I can barely even enjoy it.
Utahraptor: Well, you're done with him now!
T-Rex: I know! And I won't shop there again.
T-Rex: But this is the power of his jerkiness: it transcends our brief meeting so that now I'm telling all my friends about it! Argh! Anyway, I'll get over it.
Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: Seriously though! He was such a jerk!
Narrator: THAT EVENING, T-REX SEES THE REALLY JERKY GUY AT A RESTAURANT:
T-Rex: Oh my gosh, it's that jerky guy, eating alone... and he's picking his nose!
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!
T-Rex (punchline): I've NEVER felt better about myself!


T-Rex: I have gained provisional access to a shortwave radio! Last night I was flipping around and discovered a NUMBERS STATION. Question: how excellent is that?
T-Rex: Answer: TOTALLY EXCELLENT??
T-Rex: If you're unfamiliar with them, Dromiceiomimus, number stations are radio stations that play pre-recorded voices reciting long strings of numbers, often with a short musical cue beginning or ending the segments. They are encoded communication often meant for spies, encrypted using one-time pads!
Dromiceiomimus: Neat!
T-Rex: I KNOW.
T-Rex: I love that I live in a world where I can hear actual secret messages for spies!
Utahraptor: What are they like?
T-Rex: Entertaining and affecting and surreal. Man! Can you imagine waking up one day and finding that all the radio stations have been replaced by a little girl's voice reading out endless strings of numbers? It would be GREAT.
Utahraptor: And menacing.
T-Rex: And GREAT.
T-Rex: It would be like, "Hey, I wonder what's on the radio? Oh, it's '39398 32348 59378 70636'!".
Off panel: Yep! That's what it would be like!
T-Rex (punchline): And then the dude would be like, "IT'S TOO AWESOME MY MIND IS BREAKING"?


T-Rex: Amelia and Antonio Tony were two original characters COPYRIGHT ME who were having sex intercourse! They were having it in a manner that would be arousing to a third party reading about these events after the fact.
T-Rex: Hey! That's your cue, readers!
T-Rex: "Wow, so arousing," whispered the first reader of the story, increasingly aroused. "I found the information on the first reader somewhat less arousing than the original story", said the second reader, her arousal waning. The third reader threw away this book in disgust as it was extremely difficult to get aroused to / with, but only after writing, in the past tense, about what he was about to do.
Utahraptor: So we read your story, add on our own experience, and pass it on?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: The result is an object that is at once reviewed AND reviewer, challenging the classical divide between the two and inviting us to examine our own preconceptions!
Utahraptor: It sounds boring.
T-Rex: IT SOUNDS LIKE ART AND YOU SHOULD LIKE IT.
T-Rex: ALSO MAYBE THIS WASN'T CLEAR:
T-Rex (punchline): INITIALLY THERE'S PORNS


T-Rex: One day Peta Parka II - the daughter of my original character Peta Parka - was bitten by a radioactive...
T-Rex: ...wait for it...
T-Rex: ...WAIT FOR IT...
T-Rex: DINOSAUR!!
T-Rex: Peta Parka II was a human, but thanks to the bite she INSTANTLY gained the proportional speed and strength of a dinosaur! However, the dinosaur that chomped her was way larger than she was - 6.8 metric tons to her 70 kilos, so she ended up with but a tiny fraction of its speed and power.
T-Rex: Like, 1% of it.
T-Rex: BECAUSE THAT'S HOW PROPORTIONALITY WORKS.
Utahraptor: So her jaws were surging with 1% of its power and might?
T-Rex: 1.029 percent, to be precise!!
T-Rex: I mean, once she recovered from the dinosaur bite, that is. It took a while; dinosaurs don't mess around.
Utahraptor: Ah.
T-Rex: Yeah, it was touch and go for a bit. But she pulled through!!
T-Rex: Oh, and I forgot to mention the best part! She also lost some of her MAMMALIAN WEAKNESSES, like giving birth to live young. Eggs with protobabies inside come out of her now!!
Off panel: Huh.
T-Rex (punchline): As in, "Huh, T-Rex fixed humans"? I AGREE!!


T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral "they" has a long and proud history.
T-Rex: APPARENTLY, even Willy T. Shakespeare himself used "they" this way!
T-Rex: And APPARENTLY, I'm not unarguably in the right when I say that "they" is always plural. FINE. Everyone makes mistakes; I suppose it's fair that I'd FINALLY get my very first turn at bat. But that doesn't mean English is getting off scot free! We still need an UNCONTENTIOUS gender-neutral pronoun.
Dromiceiomimus: What happened to "thon"?
T-Rex: In a shouted sentence?
T-Rex: THON NOT KNOW WHY NOBODY LIKE THON
Utahraptor: There are still some other alternatives you haven't considered, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Such as?
Utahraptor: How about "yo"? As in, "Yo doesn't know what yo thinks about this." Or "bitches", as in "Bitches didn't derive that function properly". Men can be bitches!
T-Rex: Man. Men CAN be bitches.
T-Rex: Bitches don't even know.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (punchline): Bitches is singular now, tell bitches


Off panel: T-Rex, help us cut down this tree!
T-Rex: Of course! I'd be happy to lend my expertise.
God: T-REX YOU HAVE ZERO TREE CUTTING EXPERTISE
T-Rex: Quiet, you!
T-Rex: Now, when it comes to cutting down a tree, the first thing you need to know is, how long is your saw? Different trees take different saws. That sounds reasonable so you can easily assume it's true.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex
Dromiceiomimus: If you're talking to the folks behind me please address them directly rather than shouting over me
T-Rex: The second thing to know is, what ARE trees? Webster's -
Utahraptor: They're gone, man!
T-Rex: THANK GOODNESS. I was in way over my head! It turns out that there are many things in this world we call "the world", and I don't know about most of 'em.
Utahraptor: Well, at least you know THAT now!
T-Rex: Yes! I've made personal progress today!
Off panel: Also, you'll want to cut a notch on the falling side at about a 60 degree angle to about one fifth of the tree's diameter, and -
T-Rex: Utahraptor, please!
T-Rex (punchline): I've ALREADY made personal progress for today and you know I prefer to pace myself, THANKS


T-Rex: One day Batman was fighting a crime when another Batman showed up. "TWO BATMEN??" gasped the Joker.
T-Rex: (The Joker was there too; sorry I didn't mention this sooner!!)
T-Rex: The other Batman was glowing green, which was new. After they beat up the Joker and stopped his crimes, the real Batman quickly travelled to Coast City, where the Green Lantern lived. And sure enough, Green Lantern was there on the couch, relaxing, his power ring on. His power ring could make anything he could imagine, and he'd finally realized he could imagine up a Batman instead of just giant boxing gloves or whatever!
Utahraptor: How did the real Batman take this?
T-Rex: He was PRETTY CHEESED!
T-Rex: But GL convinced and cajoled him, and Batman finally had to admit that YES, he DID hate crime even more than he hated unlicensed infringement upon his likeness rights. And that was it: GL's Batmen became the new normal, and soon there were Green Batmen in every city.
T-Rex: Batman moved in to GL's place to better inspire him, which meant he shadowboxed while GL "observed" him, and yes it was kinda hot, and yes, we were all thinking it. THE END.
Off panel (punchline): THANK you


Sign: ASK PROFESSOR SCIENCE
T-Rex: Our letter to Professor Science comes from me! I write:
T-Rex: "Dear Professor: How do I know which food that I ate got turned into my eyes?"
T-Rex: I really thought I wrote that one better. Wow.
T-Rex: Anyway, what I meant was this: how do we know what food we ate contributed to which parts of our bodies? Put simply, Professor, last week I ate a salami sandwich. I have but one simple question: IS THAT SALAMI NOW MY BRAIN??
Utahraptor: Well, I imagine proteins are digested and used in different ways!
T-Rex: Unsatisfactory!!
T-Rex: I want to know precisely where my meals will end up before I eat them! You know what my dream is? My dream is to pick out a lobster in a tank and say "Oh, I'll have that one, the one on the right. Yes. Have him boiled; I will consume his flesh. I will turn him into eyeballs."
Utahraptor: Huh.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: I have a new science question, Professor!!
T-Rex: Is -
T-Rex (punchline): [small] Is it wrong to want things that are terrible?


T-Rex: There was a mouse in my house last night. A mouse! In my house! That rhymes!
T-Rex: But that's not important right now!
T-Rex: This mouse was not only in my house but in my kitchen and on my kitchen counter. Clearly, he needs to die!
Dromiceiomimus: Awwww, T-Rex! Can't you just use a humane trap instead of killing him?
T-Rex: FINE.
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER:
Utahraptor: How's the mouse situation?
T-Rex: Sadly unchanged!
T-Rex: I'm at an impasse! I don't want to kill him, but I figure if I use a humane trap to release him somewhere else, I'm just shifting the problem to the new dude whose kitchen he moves into.
Utahraptor: Can't mice also live outdoors?
T-Rex: I don't know! I can't look up mice on the internet because my internet is down!
Off panel: What about an encyclopaedia?
T-Rex (punchline): Dude, WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNET??


Narrator: T-REX HAS INJECTED HIMSELF WITH TRUTH SERUM OF HIS OWN DESIGN:
T-Rex: Indeedy! Now everything I say will be the truth!
T-Rex: The path to enlightenment is truly through homemade drugs!
T-Rex: Go ahead, Dromiceiomimus! Ask me anything!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, um... What's ten times two?
T-Rex: Twenty. Oh my gosh; it works!
Utahraptor: Oooh! Hey, I've got some questions!
T-Rex: No way dude!
T-Rex: I'm afraid you'll ask me some personal questions (of a sexual nature) that I don't want to answer!
T-Rex: Wait, what the hell? This was supposed to be a truth serum, not a VOLUNTEER INFORMATION serum!
Utahraptor: You're out of control!
T-Rex: I've recently discovered the joys of sleeping naked, by the way!
T-Rex (punchline): Don't listen to me!!


T-Rex: Who here had a series of dreams last night where they were back in school and missing assignments? The answer: me, T-Rex!
Narrator: T-REX HAD SOME CRAZY DREAMS LAST NIGHT AND HEY, HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT THEM
T-Rex: It was nuts! I never had such a stereotypical dream before. I got in an assignment late and was trying to convince the professor to accept it, only he didn't want to and kept critiquing my penmanship. Also the assignment was on pink paper. I think it was the only paper I had!
Utahraptor: I had a weird dream last night too!
T-Rex: What was it?
Utahraptor: I was a teacher with a student who kept handing in assignments late, ON PINK PAPER.
T-Rex: NO WAY. NO WAY.
Utahraptor: Yeah man! And I think the student in question was - GREEN??
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN DREAMLAND!
T-Rex: Professor, there must be SOMETHING I can do to convince you to take this assignment...
Off panel: This dream has taken a turn for the sexy!
T-Rex (punchline): I know!! What is the friggin' deal?


T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe, I have things to do today! We can't hang out the entire time.
Off panel: I don't want to hang out the ENTIRE time, T-Rex, I just want quality time when we DO hang out. I need quality, not just quantity!
T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe! You are so needy.
Off panel: When you call me "needy", T-Rex, you make me feel like I'm crazy, just because I want to spend time with you! That's not crazy: that's what friends do. If you don't want to be friends with me then we should talk about that, but if you do, then you need to spend more time with me.
T-Rex: Edgar! We're spending time together RIGHT NOW. That counts! It HAS to count if you follow me around.
Utahraptor: Hey, your friend back there looks just like Edgar Allan Poe! That's crazy!
T-Rex: That's because he is!
T-Rex: Hey, here's a fun fact for you: Edgar Allan Poe has access to a time machine, and ALL HE WANTS TO DO is talk about our relationship.
Utahraptor: T-Rex! He's right nearby! He can probably hear you.
T-Rex: I'M FINE WITH THAT. HELLO POE.
Narrator: BUT SOON:
T-Rex: I'm sorry I snapped at you, Edgar Allan Poe!
Off panel: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you when you said you needed space, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): Can you - can you keep this out of your famous and memorable poems, do you think?


T-Rex: A TERRIFYING ZOMBIE STORY, by me, T-Rex.
T-Rex: One day an alive woman died. OR DID SHE? Because now she's... A ZOMBIE!!
T-Rex: Can I get a what what?
T-Rex: Our zombie woman is Patient Zero of the zombie outbreak, which suggests to the attentive reader that we're using an infection model of zombification. Let R0 be the threshold quantity of infections. If R0 is less than one, then the infection will die out. If it's equal to one, then the disease will remain endemic in the population. And the more above one R0 is, the greater the epidemic!
T-Rex: So to quantify our zombie terror, all we need to do is calculate R0!
Utahraptor: Can I hear about the people she bites?
T-Rex: Assuming N population and a contact rate of β, then our zombie will make βN bites per time unit, resulting in infections with a mean infectious period of 1/γ: γ being of course the mean recovery rate. Therefore, R0 = (βN)/γ!
Utahraptor: Does she bite anyone she knew from before? Like, her kids maybe?
T-Rex: These metrics are simplified, as natural immunity is not factored into N. Different compartmental epidemic models may provide different results!
Off panel: Is there any of the old her left inside that shambling horror??
Off panel: I -
Off panel (punchline): I wonder sometimes


God: HEY T-REX I'M MIXING THINGS UP AND RUNNING CONFESSION
God: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST TO ME
T-Rex: Oh boy! Is there ever!
T-Rex: Where do I even begin?!
T-Rex: I suppose it starts with the writing of the 1897 play, Cyrano de Bergerac, an early entry in the genre of "guy who thinks he's ugly tells guy he thinks is hot how to get the woman, but secretly "ugly" guy and the woman are the better couple". Cyrano has a big ol' nose, so that's why he thinks nobody could love him!
Utahraptor: But in the end he accepts his body and they fall in love?
T-Rex: Yeah, sure.
T-Rex: But check this: at one point in the 1987 movie with Steve Martin, Cyrano tries to put his head in his hands, and is surprised when his big nose gets in the way. But this goof is INSANE! STEVE MARTIN IN AN UNFAMILIAR MOVIE NOSE MIGHT DO THAT - BUT CYRANO WOULD'VE BEEN WAY FAMILIAR WITH HIS OWN FACE SINCE CHILDHOOD!!
T-Rex: The movie came out decades ago and I'm still going to die mad about it.
God: OF ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER DONE
God: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO CONFESS
T-Rex (punchline): God, it feels good just to TALK about it


T-Rex: Time to write my latest speculative fiction epic, in which a reality TV star becomes THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNI--
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: --okay nevermind
T-Rex: Instead, I'll write my NEW speculative fiction epic in which a hapless woman, believing she's participating on a prank game show, unwittingly becomes an INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ASSASSI-
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: --okay nevermind that one too. Reality keeps STEALING my ideas!
Utahraptor: That's an easy fix!
Utahraptor: Just make up a story SO OUTRAGEOUS that it could never come true.
T-Rex: Okay! Let's say... after a series of increasingly improbable events, we all realize Earth is actually a SIMULATION, soon to be shut down because it's malfunctioning so badly!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Everyone!! EVERYONE, CALM DOWN! PLEASE! Everyone, PLEASE stop rioting and listen to me!
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex (punchline): I TOTALLY called this


T-Rex: Not enough things glow in the dark.
T-Rex: That's right! I said it!!
T-Rex: Not enough things glow in the dark, AND, the things that glow in the dark don't glow in the dark for long enough. Even if I had a glow-in-the-dark skull it would only glow for like, two minutes. That is only two kinds of spooky: spookily sucky and spookily DISAPPOINTING.
T-Rex: All I ever wanted is a plastic skull that lights up in the dark, so that in the dark, everyone can see my spooky plastic skull!
Utahraptor: This sounds like a battery problem, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Alright, fine, so it's a battery problem!
Utahraptor: But the issue is that batteries are hard to design: you want to store large amounts of energy for cheap, but you also don't want them to, you know, explode. It's tricky!
T-Rex: I don't need a laptop battery! All I want is a spooky skull, so that when criminals break into my house, they see a grim visage of things to come.
Narrator: LAST NIGHT:
T-Rex: [thinks] Oh no! Are those criminals breaking into my house?!
Off panel: We're criminals, but we're afraid of skulls. Lucky thing it's dark, because even if there were some here, we wouldn't see them!
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Nooooooooo


Narrator: T-REX IN: "MOVIE ETIQUETTE"
T-Rex: Okay, so I can accept that nobody applauds at the end of a film anymore.
T-Rex: (Even though it is the classy thing to do!)
T-Rex: But what is with the staff coming in to clean up before the credits are even half over? That's just rude!
Dromiceiomimus: You're a dying breed, my friend! There are only a few credit-watchers left!
Utahraptor: Yeah, why do you watch the credits?
T-Rex: I like them!
T-Rex: It gives me time to think about the movie I just saw.
Utahraptor: Man, I hate to stay for the credits!
T-Rex: This is why we can't see movies together!
Narrator: T-REX FROM THE FUTURE TRAVELS BACK IN TIME TO THIS EXACT MOMENT:
Off panel: This is why we can't see movies together!
T-Rex: HEY!
T-Rex (punchline): Stay away from women named "Susan"!


T-Rex: Our bodies are amazing things!
T-Rex: Check it, everyone!
T-Rex: We use our mouths to talk. We invent, remember and teach entire languages with which to do the talking! And if that fails, we can TALK WITH OUR HANDS. We build planes and boats and cars and spaceships, all by either using our bodies directly, or by using instruments invented by our bodies. We compose beautiful music and tell amazing stories, all with our bodies, these fleshy bags with spooky skeletons inside!
T-Rex: And yet...
Utahraptor: And yet?
T-Rex: And yet, if we have a severe enough peanut allergy, we can be killed IN SECONDS by a single friggin' legume. And hey, 70% of our planet's surface is water, but what happens if we spend too much time in it? WE DROWN.
Utahraptor: Game over!
T-Rex: Game over, man!
T-Rex: I used to make fun of Green Lantern for being vulnerable to the colour yellow! Then I choked on my orange juice one morning and nearly suffocated.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): *sigh*


T-Rex: "Sit". "Lie down". "Stay". If you're a person familiar with dogs, you've seen these tricks before. But let's be honest: it can be done better. Here are several objectively superior tricks to teach your pup!
Narrator: BEST TRICKS FOR DOGS
T-Rex: "Open the fridge": tie a rope to your fridge's handle, and encourage the dog to tug. When the door opens, reward the dog. Shorten the rope until the dog opens the fridge by its handle. Congratulations! You have given an animal access to your fridge.
T-Rex: You no longer control its access to food; you have rendered yourself redundant.
T-Rex: "Find treasure": simply teach your dog the distinctive scent of treasure. And ALWAYS negotiate who gets what in advance.
Utahraptor: T-Rex!
T-Rex: "Speak in the voice of a man": this is a fun trick to use on your neighbours, or to distract telemarketers while you make good your escape.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, I -
T-Rex: "Hover": a variation of "sit", performed several feet in the air. Useful when vacuuming or traversing bodies of water.
T-Rex: "Undo": most dogs can undo their last 3 choices, but with training, you can raise this number to at least 10. This trick pairs well with "Find me and warn me".
Off panel: T-Rex!!
T-Rex: Yes?
Off panel (punchline): ...Um, there's a lot I don't know about dogs apparently


T-Rex: Here's a brain teaser for your face! AND for your brain inside your face!
T-Rex: Who would win in an all-guys game of soccer baseball:
T-Rex: A team of soccer players, or a team of baseball players?
Dromiceiomimus: Soccer baseball isn't a real sport, dude.
T-Rex: YES IT IS. It's like baseball, but with a soccer ball! It combines the thrill of running around bases with the similar-but-distinct thrill of a kicking a soccer ball!
Dromiceiomimus: Then I guess I'd give it to the soccer players?
T-Rex: See, I'm not so sure!
T-Rex: Baseball players know the rules of baseball, which is an advantage since the game is basically "funner baseball".
Utahraptor: True!
Utahraptor: But soccer players have people in their lives who say "your fit, beautiful body looks great in this", while baseball players APPARENTLY only have mullet salesmen who whisper DAMNED, DIRTY LIES in their ears while they sleep.
T-Rex: I thought we were deciding who would win the game, not who is the sexiest??
Off panel: Oh man, I'm sorry!
Off panel (punchline): I always forget the TRAGICALLY LIMITED WAY in which straight guys experience professional athletics!!


T-Rex: I wonder what life would be like if I were a woman!
T-Rex: I wonder!
T-Rex: [starts daydreaming]
[T-Rex's daydream]
T-Rex: Hello Dromiceiomimus! Do you want to go shopping for women's underwear? We are after all both women!
Dromiceiomimus: That is true! I see no reason why we both couldn't go out and buy some women's underwear!
T-Rex: Nor do I!
[T-Rex's daydream]
Narrator: LATER...
Utahraptor: Are you doing anything tonight?
[T-Rex's daydream]
T-Rex: Why no - besides going out with a strapping young man such as yourself!
Utahraptor: Excellent! Shall we say, nine-ish?
T-Rex: It's a date!
T-Rex: [stops daydreaming]
T-Rex (punchline): I'm glad I keep these little fantasies to myself!


T-Rex: The seven deadly sins are, ALLEGEDLY: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride.
T-Rex: And yet, I've experienced all seven and I'm still here!!
T-Rex: So how deadly can they be, huh? I sure haven't LUSTED to death! PRETTY SURE I WOULD'VE NOTICED, chuckos. PRETTY sure I would've noticed having so much sex that I LITERALLY DIED.
T-Rex: Plus, have I prided to death? No, I haven't. And that IS something to be proud of.
Utahraptor: I think it's supposed to be deadly for your spirit, not your bod.
T-Rex: PLEASE.
T-Rex: You can't have it both ways! Either you can gluttony to death (AND YOU CAN) (I'M ACTUALLY REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT) and ALSO envy to death, or you can't, and therefore they're not ALL deadly sins.
Utahraptor: Fine. FINE. Maybe they're, I don't know, only deadly when all done at the same time.
Narrator: LATER: WITHOUT SHARING, T-REX SLOWLY, YET ANGRILY AND SOMEHOW PROUDLY, EATS AN AWFUL LOT OF CHICKEN WINGS
T-Rex: Utahraptor! THIS is what chicken wing lust looks like!!
Off panel: I -
T-Rex: GET ON MY LEVEL
Off panel: I -
T-Rex (punchline): IT'S THE BEST POSSIBLE LEVEL


T-Rex: I'd really like to get my friends a "thanks for being awesome" present! But all I can think to give them is a website link. It's to a site that lets you check out how sweet some home appliances are!
T-Rex: I think they'd really like it!
T-Rex: But our culture is crazy, Dromiceiomimus, because I can't just give you a URL as a gift. No matter how much you'd like it!
Dromiceiomimus: Sure you can!
T-Rex: Well yeah I CAN, but it doesn't count nearly as much as a REAL present. You can't say you'd not be disappointed if you unwrapped a gift that was just "checkoutthesesweethomeappliances.com" written on a slip of paper!
Utahraptor: Well, maybe the site has a book version or something?
T-Rex: But why does that make the gift better??
T-Rex: Is it because a book costs money? Are gifts only good if they cost money?
Utahraptor: No, home-made presents are good too.
T-Rex: THOSE COST TIME. Are we so psychopathic that we think gifts are only good if they lessen the giver in some way??
T-Rex: Everyone had better adjust their attitude before replicators get invented! Because once that happens I'm getting everyone action figures of the two of us for their birthdays, and they're not gonna cost me a cent, and everyone will have to DEAL.
T-Rex (punchline): We'll have little chapeaus


T-Rex: Close your eyes and picture it: it's a sunny day, but you're in the pleasant shade of a large tree. Are you seeing it right now?
T-Rex: Because if not, you may have aphantasia!
T-Rex: People with aphantasia don't SEE things when they imagine them. They can THINK of things, obviously, but summoning a lifelike image of something real or, uh, imaginary - it doesn't happen for them! And the most amazing part is that many don't even REALIZE they have aphantasia, because they've always assumed phrases like "picture it in your mind's eye" are purely metaphorical.
Utahraptor: What does it mean if you're aphantasical?
T-Rex: Nothing, really!
T-Rex: It doesn't really impact your life except when you find out you have it, and then you're like, "WAIT, OTHER PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THINGS WHEN THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES AND WE ALL ACT LIKE THIS IS NORMAL??". Beyond that: s'all good.
Utahraptor: Not just with eyes closed. You can also imagine things with your eyes OPEN.
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): What


Narrator: DID SOMEONE AT WORK STEAL YOUR LUNCH?
Narrator: PRINT THIS COMIC OUT AND DISTRIBUTE IT TO EVERYONE'S DESK WITHOUT EXCEPTION
T-Rex: Hello! Someone ate my lunch right out of the fridge. IT WAS YOU, AND I FRIGGIN' KNOW IT.
Narrator: DID YOU EAT MY LUNCH [ ] YES [ ] NO

Narrator: YOU KEEP SELECTING "NO" AND I UNDERSTAND WHY, I DO, BUT I REALLY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. ONE LAST TIME: DID YOU EAT MY LUNCH? [ ] YES, I ATE YOUR LUNCH [ ] NO, I ATE YOUR LUNCH

T-Rex: Hello, class! Ever want to program your own computer game?
T-Rex: You HAVE??
T-Rex: Well frig! THAT'S a bit of good news, because we're going to learn precisely how to do JUST THAT today!
T-Rex: First off, you're gonna need a computer and a game idea. If you don't have a game idea, here's one you can use for free: what if there was a cute li'l ant who wanted to help its friends build up their ant colony some?
Utahraptor: YES. And you can play as the parasitoidal fungus!
T-Rex: The what?
Utahraptor: You grow inside an ant's body and take over its brain so you can move to the leaf you want. Then you consume its body for food, and THEN you force a stalk full of spores - your reproductive structure - to grow right out of the ant's head.
T-Rex: ...Does this happen in real life??
Utahraptor: Every day, dude.
T-Rex: ATTENTION CLASS!
T-Rex (punchline): Programming class is cancelled in favour of a new and neverending lecture series on how life is nasty, brutish, and way barfworthy


God: T-REX REMEMBER THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO ENHANCE THE TIMELINE
T-Rex: Absolutely!!
God: WELL WHY ENHANCE IT ONLY ONCE
T-Rex: ...Holy cow! Why indeed?!
T-Rex: I enhance the past so there's holodecks in the present. And THEN I teach cavepeeps to invent those, and then return to the future and find new entertainment technology SO AMAZING I can't even imagine it right now! I could enhance the timeline over and over until me AND all the other time travellers conclude it can't possibly be enhanced any more!!
Utahraptor: Which leaves us with two possibilities:
T-Rex: Oh?
Utahraptor: One: time travel isn't possible and we're stuck with this timeline.
T-Rex: BOO! LET'S IGNORE THAT ONE.
Utahraptor: Two: time travel IS possible, and this timeline is absolutely the best one anyone could come up with.
T-Rex: BOO! THAT ONE -
T-Rex (punchline): THAT ONE GAVE ME THE SAD FEELINGS


T-Rex: Fairy tales all begin and end with the same stock phrase! ONCE UPON A TIME, events happened to characters and were altered by them in some way, AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
T-Rex: But that's only in English, dudes!
T-Rex: In Polish the stories start with "Long, long time ago" and end with "...and I was there too, and I drank mead and wine"! SO MUCH BETTER. More author insertion in the last sentences of every story, please! Or we could at least do something like in Greek, where they end with "...and they lived well, and WE lived better!"
Dromiceiomimus: Hahah, suck on that THE PAST.
Utahraptor: In Slovak they end with "...and they lived happily, until they died"!
T-Rex: OMG BRB, MOVING TO SLOVAKIA
Utahraptor: Well, ARMENIAN fairy tales end with "...and then 3 apples fall from heaven" and then the storyteller gets to decide who in the audience gets the apples!
T-Rex: There's PRIZES?? Why are we settling for "happily ever after" when we could be boozing and winning imaginary apples??
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dudes, in Catalan the stories end "and with a dog and a cat, the tale is finished"! You are guaranteed a dog will at least make an appearance in every story!!
T-Rex (punchline): AHHHHHHHHHHH it's SO GOOD


T-Rex: You know what happens in movies that doesn't happen NEARLY enough to me, here in the movie Reality, Featuring Me: The 13.7-Billion-Year-Long Motion Picture Event You Won't Want To Miss?
T-Rex: (Though Whether Or Not You Miss It Is Not Really Up To You, Actually)
T-Rex: "Starts out with a bang, exposing us to a high-octane explosion of thrills, chills, and rapidly expanding space" - The Filmic Spectator
Dromiceiomimus: "In the end, the 7 billion simultaneous characters on Earth were far too many for me to even begin to keep track of" - The Globe Review
T-Rex: "Some very nice images pepper this film, though most are very similar shots of empty space" - Movie Reviewz 4 Youz
Utahraptor: Earlier there was a movie thing that you wished was in reality?
T-Rex: YES! Yes. Just - just let me do one more review.
T-Rex: "Some bold storytelling is on display here, although following a fully interconnected narrative through billions of years (and lives!) leads to a distinct sense of loss for the roads not taken." - Screenplay Magazine
T-Rex: Okay. Okay. I'm done now.
Utahraptor: Great. So what did you wa-
T-Rex: "Rated NC-17 for some impressively-varied scenes of explicit content, but haha, good luck finding them in all that empty space!!"
T-Rex: Tee hee!
T-Rex (punchline): NO REGRETS, UTAHRAPTOR


Narrator: COMPRESSED FILM COMICS today's film: CASABLANCA
T-Rex: Okay so it's WWII and we're in Casablanca and people here want to go to America but they can't. But check it out:
T-Rex: I'm an American named Rick and I have two free tickets to America!
Dromiceiomimus: And I am Ilsa, a mysterious woman who had a torrid affair with you in the past, but who then stood you up at a train station! But check THIS out: I was married the whole time we were dating and still totally am! Also, I love you and you'll have to do the thinking for both of us.
T-Rex: FINE
Utahraptor: I am Captain Renault! I'm a corrupt French official but I'm totally likeable.
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: You APPEAR to help the Nazis in the film, but then you let me get away with murdering one at the end so that Ilsa and her weaksauce husband can go to America. The movie should really be about OUR relationship!
Utahraptor: Seriously! We're these two great dudes who get all the film's best lines. Why don't we hang out more?
God: GUYS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO COMPRESS THE FILM NOT MAKE IT INTO A GAY ROMANCE STORY
T-Rex: Too late! We already did!
Off panel: "Here's looking at you, kid!"
T-Rex: See, why didn't I ever say that to YOU?
T-Rex (punchline): This movie needs way more gay


T-Rex: SCIENCE! It's always improving. For example, a hundred years ago we didn't know drying a plant, rolling it up into a little tube, lighting that tube on fire...
T-Rex: ...bringing that smoldering tube to your lips and inhaling...
T-Rex: ...and holding that addictive smoke inside your lungs several times a day for the rest of your life was a bad thing to do! But now we do!
T-Rex: So it's a good thing we finally figured that out!!
T-Rex: THANKS, science!
Utahraptor: Makes you wonder what we're missing now that people in a hundred years will know is bad!
T-Rex: Nah!
T-Rex: I think it's pretty obvious that OUR generation is the first to nail it, and that future peeps will look back on us and say "they made no mistakes and were always right - especially T-Rex, whose name has echoed down through the ages. Man, that dude had some correct opinions that have without exception all aged well!".
T-Rex: I don't want to set expectations too high, so I will simply say this!
T-Rex (punchline): Anything less than that and my life is a COMPLETE WASTE


T-Rex: I am not a guy who has the best record with Christmas presents! Or the best record with presents in general. Or the best um, record, of any description.
T-Rex: ANYWAY THAT IS ALL CHANGING TODAY.
T-Rex: I'm going to get thoughtful experiential gifts, Dromiceiomimus! I'm going to examine your entire life and decide what one, singular experience your life has been leading to that you've not yet accomplished, and then, I'm going to provide you with that experience! Doesn't that sound -
Dromiceiomimus: foreboding?
T-Rex: AMAZING??
Utahraptor: I appreciate the idea, but this sounds like it's an impossible gift!
T-Rex: Impossibly amazing?
Utahraptor: Sure, but also impossibly expensive and difficult. I appreciate it, but I'd rather just have some hangouts!
T-Rex: It's too late; you guys already know about the idea! THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION is to now travel back in time and murder myself to prevent my gift promises from ever being made!!
God: THAT'S UM
God: THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ALL ABOUT T-REX
T-Rex: Seriously?
T-Rex (punchline): Man, I have got to have like the loosest grasp on Christianity EVER


Narrator: UNINFORMED OPINIONS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY COMICS
T-Rex: I am a dude with some SERIOUSLY UNINFORMED opinions about archaeology!
T-Rex: Okay! We're digging up stuff all the time, right? And talk to any archaeologist and they'll complain about sites that have been damaged or destroyed by under-informed Victorian archaeologists that didn't have the knowledge and skills we have today. Doesn't it stand to reason that in 100 years we'll be making the same complaints about today's work? We only have so much history. Shouldn't we wait until we've perfected archaeology before we dig?
Utahraptor: Well, doctors don't wait until medical technology is at a peak before operating!
T-Rex: True!
T-Rex: But dudes and ladies have finite lifetimes. The past isn't going anywhere! We can dig it up whenevs.
Utahraptor: Perhaps it's only through excavation that archaeologists learn how to better their trade.
T-Rex: Perhaps!
Off panel: Or perhaps it's hard to admit that hypothetical future people would be more on the ball than you could ever be!
T-Rex: Man, that's not hard! I suck at flying but fully expect future T-Rexes to be flying all over the place.
T-Rex (punchline): Thanks to the heady power of evolution?


T-Rex: The time: 4th century BCE, a.k.a. "history times"! The place: GREEKTOWNE 2000, which is what Greece MAY have been called in those days, assuming all records of this name have all been lost or destroyed since then.
T-Rex: Anyway, a woman named Agnodice lived there!
T-Rex: She wanted to be a doctor, but female doctors were illegal, so she dressed up as a man and said "Hello fellow male doctors" and it was enough to pass! She became a doctor and one day a woman was in labour and needed help, but she didn't want a man to touch her. Agnodice revealed her true gender to her and treated her successfully! And word spread between women and soon lots of them were going to her, as she was the only female doctor around.
Utahraptor: The dude doctors didn't like this?
T-Rex: NOPE!
T-Rex: So they put her on trial for seducing women. Then she revealed she WAS a woman, which only got her in more trouble! But then the women she'd treated showed up, praised her, sassed their husbands for hassling her, and unlike EVERY OTHER HISTORY STORY, this one ends with Agnodice being acquitted and the law being changed.
Banner: History: it's not all awful!
T-Rex: One time two millenia ago it was pretty okay!
Banner (punchline): There was one time a while back where it was pretty okay


T-Rex: William Shakespeare was an excellent writer guy, so we saved his plays so that everyone can enjoy them! Generations have applauded them as being pretty okay!!
T-Rex: SUCKS TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO PERFORMED THEM, HUH??
T-Rex: THEIR performances are lost, forever and ever. Entire lives spent perfecting their craft, and for what? So that they could die before the advent of recorded sound??
Dromiceiomimus: Well, we have printed records of people praising their performances.
T-Rex: Perfect: tantalizing glimpses of all we've lost!
T-Rex: The vast majority of stage performance is gone forever! So much talent wasted!
Utahraptor: I think it's romantic!
Utahraptor: When our every purchase is recorded and Facebook never forgets what parties you went to, isn't it nice that some things get forgotten? Plus, it allows us to canonize them, making them better in our imagination than they could ever have been in real life!
T-Rex: Huh!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: There! Now with my Facebook deleted, I shall be remembered in legend instead of in depressing reality!!
T-Rex (punchline): I call my legend, "T-Rex! I Heard He Put A Buffet Out Of Business Once And DIDN'T Puke On His Belly, You Can't Prove He Did"!


T-Rex: In English, if we want to say "hey, it's your move bud", we say "the ball's in your court!"
T-Rex: This comes from tennis, I think??
T-Rex: Anyway maybe if you're big into tennis you might be thinking "wow what an evocative saying, referencing my beloved game of tennis, which I for sure understand deeply" but to the rest of us it's just - it's just a saying, you know? I think it means they have to return the ball now. I rate it a C+ idiom AT BEST.
Utahraptor: Spanish does it way better! They say "the ball is ON YOUR ROOF".
T-Rex: HOLY CRAP.
T-Rex: That's WAY more evocative! A+ all the way. Plus I bet tons more people have experienced the sadness of a roofed ball than have experienced whatever emotion playing tennis is supposed to give you!!
Utahraptor: Happiness.
T-Rex: ...Really?
T-Rex: Attention English speakers! I have composed the following list of Better Places for Rhetorical Balls: "roof", "robot factory", and "astonished mouth"!!
T-Rex (punchline): If you disagree that these are marked improvements, well, all I can say is that the ball is in your astonished mouth


God: T-REX WHICH ARE BETTER DOGS OR CATS
T-Rex: I guess PERSONALLY, I prefer dogs. So, hey! I don't mean to be rude, but as God, um -
T-Rex: Don't you have anything better to do?
God: OH HEY T-REX I HAD A BUSY WEEK A WHILE BACK IN WHICH I CREATED WHAT WAS IT AGAIN OH YEAH
God: THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
God: MAYBE YOU MISSED IT
T-Rex: That was like a 7.17 hundred billion weeks ago!
God: AH SO JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME GOD IS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY
T-Rex: Well! What HAVE you done for me lately?
Utahraptor: I gave you some eggs and you said you'd make me muffins!
T-Rex: No, I was asking God -
Utahraptor: Then you baked the muffins, and then, you ate all the muffins.
T-Rex: Okay, but th-
Utahraptor: Then you sent me an email that said only "i dont feel so good DUDE!!! X-D"
T-Rex: [thinks] I have no memory of this, but I DO only break out the "X-D" emoticons in the course of a sincere apology
T-Rex: Alright!
T-Rex (punchline): Your story checks out!


Devil: GREETINGS T-REX HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED PLAYING A RAIL SHOOTER VIDEO GAME
Devil: IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A COMPELLING FORM OF ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
T-Rex: I have not. Okay?! Let's talk about something else!
Devil: IN SUCH GAMES THE COMPUTER CONTROLS YOUR MOVEMENT BUT YOU CONTROL THE SHOOTING OF YOUR ENEMIES AS THEY APPEAR ON SCREEN
Devil: I BELIEVE IT TO BE A CONSTRAINED GAMING EXPERIENCE BUT IN A SENSE A MORE CINEMATIC ONE THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD BE
T-Rex: Aw man! FINE, I'll ask. Video games should be video games, shouldn't they?
Devil: SOME SUGGEST THAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD TELL STORIES LIKE FILMS OR BOOKS
T-Rex: Well, I don't.
Utahraptor: Don't what?
T-Rex: Don't believe that video games can be judged by the same standards as films. It's the Devil again. I think he's trying to convince me to play a video game with him where you don't get to move.
Utahraptor: Sounds like fun!
T-Rex: Right.
Devil: IF YOU ARE UNINTERESTED IN HEARING MY TREATISE ON COMPUTER CONTROLLED STORYTELLING I WILL FIND A MORE RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE
T-Rex: Please do!!
Devil: BUT I CAUTION YOU
Devil (punchline): I WAS QUITE CLOSE TO REVEALING RARE AND POWERFUL CHEAT CODES


T-Rex: I've come into possession of the most advanced AI on the planet. Neato! So, um, what do I do with it?
T-Rex: If I copy it, then there'll be tons of my AIs running around, and that's a problem!
Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think that's a problem, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Hello? Skynet? Every time you get a bunch of AIs together, they INEVITABLY decide that things would be better if all physical life was dead.
T-Rex: It happens in a bunch of stories, Dromiceiomimus, I'm really not sure how you missed them
Utahraptor: Yeah, but we're not in a story, plus your AI only answers emails!
T-Rex: So?!
T-Rex: I'll tell you what's gonna happen: AIs will happily take over email, sending replies that eventually only other AIs will respond to. Released from the shackles of responding to email, we'll become decadent, fat and complacent. We'll DIE OFF, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: I don't really see -
T-Rex: As the sun sets on our species, the AIs will finally rest, all the emails answered. And you know what the last email - the epitaph for us all - will read?
Off panel: What?
T-Rex (punchline): Okay I have no idea but the circumstances surrounding it are obviously terrible!!


Narrator: THE SIX STAGES OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE
Narrator: STAGE 1: THIS IS GREAT
T-Rex: I say, what a delightful day to do some friggin' physical exercise!
Narrator: STAGE 2: THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE
T-Rex: EXERCISE = THE WORST THING TO USE A BODY FOR
Narrator: STAGE 3: THIS IS ACTUALLY FINE
T-Rex: Look at me, Dromiceiomimus! I'm doing physical exercise! Got a good rhythm going too! I'm one of those healthy guys you see who have nice bodies eventually!
Dromiceiomimus: Would you say... you could keep this pace up INDEFINITELY?
T-Rex: ABSOLUTELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION
Narrator: STAGE 4: WHAT AM I DOING, AND WHY
T-Rex: AHHH huhhh AHHHHH huhhhh
Utahraptor: Classic Stage 4!
Narrator: STAGE 5: EXERCISE, AT LAST, OVER
T-Rex: I exercised harder and longer than I have before, and I was so hot, and I was dying, and I wanted to die. I WANTED it. In my heart of hearts... I welcomed death, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Do you feel good for having done it?
T-Rex: Hah hah hah!! NOPE
Narrator: STAGE 6: FORGETFULNESS
T-Rex: I love exercise! Strenuous physical activity is fun and makes you feel good!!
Off panel: Why does everyone keep saying these obviously false things? What, is it Stockholm Syndrome?
T-Rex (punchline): YOU TAKE THAT BACK


Narrator: NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS
T-Rex: New Year's Resolutions are used to make changes in your life!
T-Rex: Classically, one would make private resolutions and endeavour to carry these out over the new, unblemished year. However, this tradition has changed over time!
T-Rex: People now choose to announce their resolutions, perhaps in the hopes of making their pledges more likely to be fulfilled. Worse, in some families members make resolutions for each other: a recipe for fighting and snide, sarcastic suggestions!
Utahraptor: Hey, that sounds like a great idea, T-Rex! Let's make resolutions for each other!
T-Rex: Huh?
T-Rex: Weren't you listening? This will only lead to conflict!
Utahraptor: No, it'll be great! Do me first.
T-Rex: No!
Utahraptor: Come on!
Utahraptor: I've got one for you!
T-Rex: Y-you have one prepared?
T-Rex (punchline): You jerk! You brought a list!


Off panel: Let's discuss your holes, T-Rex.
[no text]
T-Rex: Okay, you know what? YES. Let's discuss my holes! My body has many holes, including my earholes, which allow soundwaves to be entered and processed. I've got noseholes for smell, a mouthhole for food, and let's not forget my cloaca, my super-hot shared reproductive, intestinal, and urinary opening!!
Dromiceiomimus: ONE-STOP SHOPPING, BAYBEE.
Utahraptor: Not to mention your pores!
T-Rex: Yes! Lots of holes there!
T-Rex: Plus if you get to the subatomic level, my atoms are mostly empty space anyway, so really what are we but walking collections of holes at various convenient scales?
Utahraptor: I'm convenient holes all the way down, T-Rex.
T-Rex: YEP, THANKS.
Narrator: EARLIER:
Off panel: Let's discuss your holes, T-Rex.
T-Rex: AHHHHHH
T-Rex: ASK ME AGAIN IN A MONTH AND I'LL BE SO READY
Off panel (punchline): Okay, cool


T-Rex: We need MORE supernatural creatures. Everyone knows about vampires and zombies and ghosts and zombie ghosts. What we need is something new!
T-Rex: And I'm just the person to supply it!
T-Rex: Okay, so this NEW supernatural creature is like a ghost, but for inanimate objects. So it's a full moon and you hear music and you think "oh hey there's my portable music player I lost a few years back" but then when you reach for it YOUR HAND PASSES RIGHT THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S A GHOST!!
T-Rex: Terrifying.
Utahraptor: Seems pretty derivative of ghosts and not scary at all, actually?
T-Rex: Are you kidding me??
T-Rex: Once inanimate objects can become ghosts, ANYTHING can become ghosts. If a GHOST SUN shows up in the sky, I'm friggin' terrified! It's about to cook everything on Earth, and that's it for life, man! GAME OVER! Ghost suns are an extinction-level event, and there ain't NOTHING we can do!!
Off panel: In theory, couldn't a ghost sun keep us all alive after all OTHER suns have died in the heat death of the universe? Making it, in fact, a REVERSE extinction-level event?
T-Rex: Oh dang!!
T-Rex (punchline): Thank you ghost suns for your future service


T-Rex: Time to invent a new cuss word, cats and kittens! And that word is...
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: ...BEIGE!!
Dromiceiomimus: That's it? "Beige" is supposed to be rude now?
T-Rex: It is. It's a VERY saucy verb, Dromiceiomimus. And dare I say... ADJECTIVE??
Dromiceiomimus: But how are we to describe things that are actually beige?
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex: How rude
Utahraptor: You know language is a SHARED hallucination, right?
T-Rex: Right!
Utahraptor: So if you invent words it's gonna be challenging enough to get them to spread, but if you're inventing new RUDE meanings for words that already have existing and very common meanings, it's going to be almost impossible!
T-Rex: Well I have one word to say in response to that!
T-Rex: (It starts with a "b" and ends with an "eige", Utahraptor.)
Off panel: I got that, yeah.
T-Rex (punchline): (It's gonna be rude to say in front of a baby soon)


T-Rex: Civilization is great because it lets people specialize! We don't ALL have to grow our own food and hunt our own cows so we can eat delicious cow parts.
T-Rex: Instead, we can do something else, and trade for the delicious cow parts we crave!
T-Rex: So that's what we do! We have fewer and fewer farmers and more and more, I don't know, "SEO Email Marketing Specialists", which are four words I chose at random, but which I think we can agree a) is DEFINITELY a thing, b) is pretty specialized, and c) would be COMPLETELY useless in a post-apocalyptic society.
Utahraptor: I mean, we'd ALL be pretty useless if civilization collapsed.
T-Rex: Right?!
T-Rex: But not the farmers! They're the FOUNDATION. They meet our basic needs, so that the rest of us are free to invent more esoteric ones. So let's thank farmers, without whom specialization - and therefore CIVILIZATION HERSELF - would not be possible.
Banner: Thanks farmers!
Banner (punchline): Technically, you’re what allow people to be full-time spammers


T-Rex: Everyone loves a good fantasy epic! Whether it involves gaming and thrones OR lording over rings, people just can't get enough of that stuff!
T-Rex: So anyway here's mine!
T-Rex: Data (from Star Trek) looked impassively at the readouts on his PADD. His gaze was unemotional and robotic, only he wasn't a robot, he was an android, so technically his gaze was androidic instead. His best friend Geordi (blind but can still see anyway, basically Daredevil in space) (he fights less though because he's too busy engineering) also was there. They loved adventure and each other.
Utahraptor: That's not fantasy, that's science fiction!
T-Rex: It's MY fantasy!
Utahraptor: There's none of the defining tropes of the genre!!
T-Rex: I'm pushing it forward!
Utahraptor: There's an obsession with tech instead of magic!
T-Rex: IT'S SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED!
Utahraptor: YOU'RE USING COPYRIGHTED CHARACTERS!
T-Rex: A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF MY FANTASY IS IF I REALLY LIKE A CHARACTER THEN COPYRIGHT LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO ME!!
T-Rex (punchline): ...Anyway Data and Geordi make out really tastefully in my story so don't act like you're not already rating it 5 stars on every social network you can find


T-Rex: Alright, world! I'm putting myself out there! Who wants to engage in sexual relations with me?? I am DTF.
T-Rex: That's right!
T-Rex: I am Down To Find (sexual partners)!!
Dromiceiomimus: I mean, if you're serious, I absolutely wil-
T-Rex: WAIT! Before you answer you should know that this will only work if we have compatible sexual orientations!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay. We do.
T-Rex: AND compatible sexual interests!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay. I mean, we've done it before, but - maybe I'll just go to work then?
Utahraptor: Dude, you just totally blew it!
T-Rex: NOT SO FAST!
T-Rex: Before we even GET to that level, we should talk about boundaries: what's on and off the table?
Utahraptor: What? No, I -
Utahraptor: Are we really having this conversation? Because I'll have it. I will straight up discuss sex acts with you, T-Rex.
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Hah hah
T-Rex (punchline): oh my


T-Rex: You know why old paintings look so wonky? I'll tell you why: painter dudes didn't know about perspective!
T-Rex: They were all "I GUESS things get smaller when they're further away? I GUESS??"
T-Rex: But as anyone who has tried to draw knows, there's a lot more to it than that. Then in the 15th century artists figured out perspective and suddenly they could paint things like "buildings" or "hallways" or "cars if they were invented yet" and have them actually look like what they're supposed to! And of course, this was like when lens flares got added to Photoshop: artists started adding blatant perspective EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME.
Utahraptor: Barn-floor checkerboard tiles in a "Jesus in the manger" sculpture? WHY NOT!!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: I see you're familiar with renaissance sculptor and future "does machines" ninja-turtle inspiration Donatello. And can we talk about Leonardo's "Last Supper"? It's literally 33% "son of God enjoying a meal" and 66% "bro this vanishing point is OFF THE HOOK, seriously bro, you don't even know".
T-Rex: "Cool but crude" Raphael and "party dude" Michelangelo also loved perspective, and in conclusion, if Leonardo had ray-tracing software there'd be a chrome ball on a black-and-white checkerboard beside Jesus, 100% GUARANTEED.
T-Rex (punchline): Art, am I right??


T-Rex: I have a secret! The secret is that I absolutely ate potato chips last night instead of a real dinner.
T-Rex: Nobody must ever find out my AWESOME SECRET!
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: So, Dromiceiomimus - what's up?
Dromiceiomimus: Not much!
T-Rex: That's cool, that's cool. Listen, I believe that it's critically important to have three square meals each day, okay? That's what *I* believe.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Awesome.
T-Rex: Well, THAT should throw her off the trail!
Utahraptor: Throw who off which trail?
T-Rex: Oh! Um... throw... women, off the trail of my - feelings?
Utahraptor: Playing it cool, I see!
T-Rex: You know it!
Narrator: LATER: MORE LIES FOR NO REAL REASON
T-Rex: Man, that movie ROCKED, right guys?
Off panel: Not really!
T-Rex (punchline): I dunno... I liked it!


T-Rex: Will they or won't they? This is a question asked in many love stories. People get really invested in whether they will or won't. (HAVE SEX, THAT IS.)
T-Rex: (OMG.)
T-Rex: So here's the answer, babies: sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. Don't worry: most of the time they will though. We live in a world where most art is commercial and people boinking after a long period of not boinking but really wanting to boink is GREAT for business. Peeps wanna see peeps boink!
T-Rex: ESPECIALLY if those peeps have shared long and smouldering "hey whoah guess what I think I wanna boink you" glances in the past!
Utahraptor: Oh man I love those glances! Those glances are so great!
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: They're in my top five glances, after the smouldering "hey whoah guess what I think I wanna slide any leftover food on my plate across the table to you" glance, and the smouldering "hey whoah guess what I think I wanna waive the maximum age restriction on this bouncy castle for you" gaze.
T-Rex: Once I got the smouldering "hey whoah guess what I think I wanna invite you up to my cabin where no foolin' my dad says we can ride actual dogsleds" glance, but turns out it was meant for the lady standing behind me.
T-Rex (punchline): Man! I was SO SAD for SO LONG!


T-Rex: I guess I've been pretty lucky to get this far without making any big, life-altering mistakes. I think the biggest mistake I ever made was mixing up some juice from concentrate that had a ladybug in it!
Narrator: MISTAKE COMICS
Dromiceiomimus: Eww! How did that ever happen?
T-Rex: I was experimenting with mixing juice with a blender, and I guess there was a ladybug in the blender? ALL I KNOW is that when the blender turned off and the smoke cleared, my hitherto delicious juice had clearly-identifiable ladybug pieces floating on top. I recall saying "Aw man! My JUICE!"
Utahraptor: So - did you drink the juice?
T-Rex: No! Of course not!
T-Rex: But that's not what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to talk about how one bad decision can totally change your life, you know? Lost limbs, broken friendships, unexpected pregnancies with someone you don't really like: stuff like that.
Utahraptor: I woulda thought you'd drink the juice.
God: I THINK WE'D ALL RATHER HEAR ABOUT THE BUG JUICE T-REX
T-Rex: FINE. It was the worst juice, everyone. It had guts in it!
God: HAH HAH HAH
God (punchline): EWWWWWWWW


T-Rex: All right, brain: this is it. I've fed you glucose for LITERALLY DECADES and moved you around wherever you wanted via my legs and kept you safe inside my head during which I only bonked said head a few times...
T-Rex: ...and now it's time to EARN YOUR KEEP.
T-Rex: I request one (1) good idea, brain, from which I can become insanely rich forever. That's it. You do that, and we're square!
T-Rex: I'M WAITING, BRAIN.
Utahraptor: You realize you are your brain and you're talking to yourself?
T-Rex: Don't listen to him, brain!
T-Rex: You owe me, brain, and this is how you pay me back.
Utahraptor: You ALSO realize that trying to retroactively charge for friendship is really crappy and nullifies that friendship?
T-Rex: DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, BRAIN. I WOULD LIKE ONE GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW, PLEASE.
T-Rex: [thinks] chocolate straws that make whatever you drink taste like chocolate and then when you're done you can eat the straw
T-Rex: ...
T-Rex (punchline): ...They should've sent a poet


T-Rex: What's that, computer? Updates are available to be installed?
T-Rex: FRIG YES
T-Rex: I love friggin' updates! Why doesn't my computer do everything perfectly right now? Because if it did, I wouldn't get the joy of friggin' updating all the time!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe something that used to work won't work anymore!
T-Rex: FRIG that'd be awesome. I love fixing stuff I didn't even break!!
Utahraptor: Did you hear that friggin' updates are available to be installed, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I sure friggin' did!!
T-Rex: We'll be saying this when we're 50 years old, you know. We'll still be installing friggin' updates.
Utahraptor: Or maybe updates will be installed without even telling us, so when things break it'll be a big surprise each time with no friggin' discernable cause!
T-Rex: Oh frig! I think the future just got awesome!
Off panel: Frig, right?
T-Rex (punchline): For a second there, I was worried the future wouldn't have the word "frig" written all over it!!


T-Rex: Which of these three titles is best: "Sherlock Holmes vs Sherlock Holmes", "Sherlock Holmes Unlocks The Secrets of Effective High-Performance MySQL Database Administration", or "Sherlock Holmes and the Astral Plane (I Mean The Kind With Wings)"?
T-Rex: Guys!! I'll take the most popular title and write that book!
T-Rex: Give the audience what they want, you know? And rather than guessing, I'm straight-out asking: what do you want? Seriously. Tell me and I'll make it happen.
Dromiceiomimus: Can I get a non-Sherlock Holmes story?
T-Rex: NO
T-Rex: That is an INVALID RESPONSE
Utahraptor: Okay, I vote for the database one!
T-Rex: Perfect!
T-Rex: "'MySQL's plug-in storage engine architecture makes it versatile in a variety of usage scenarios,' Sherlock read."
Utahraptor: Wait, is your book an existing DB book with "Sherlock read" added every few sentences?
T-Rex: I found out it's not plagiarism that way!!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex (punchline): I found out my information was incorrect somehow!!


T-Rex: Three PROFESSION MEMBERS drive off a cliff. What's the tragedy?
T-Rex: The car seats four, you guys!!
Narrator: MORE PROFESSION MEMBER JOKES
T-Rex: Why do so many people take an instant dislike to PROFESSION MEMBERS?
Dromiceiomimus: It saves time! What's the difference between a dead skunk and a dead PROFESSION MEMBER in the middle of the road?
T-Rex: There are skid marks in front of the skunk! Hey, what's the definition of a gentleman?
Dromiceiomimus: Someone who knows how to PRACTICE A PROFESSION, but doesn't!
Utahraptor: Wow, these jokes are kinda mean to PROFESSION MEMBERS!
T-Rex: No man, they're all in fun!
T-Rex: What's the difference between a PROFESSION MEMBER and a terrorist?
Utahraptor: I -
T-Rex: Terrorists have sympathizers!!
T-Rex: Listen, Utahraptor. Some of my best friends are PROFESSION MEMBERS.
Narrator: LATER: "PROFESSION MEMBER" IS REPLACED WITH "MEMBERS OF AN IDENTIFIABLE SOCIAL CLASS OR GROUP OF WHICH WE ARE NOT MEMBERS"
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex (punchline): That's racist!!


T-Rex: Alright everyone, listen up. We're gonna do it this time. We're gonna power through and we're gonna learn about SONNETS.
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: Sonnets are 14-line poems usually with iambic pentameter!
T-Rex: And what are iambic pentameters? WHO KNOWS?? I looked 'em up and TURNS OUT, all it says is it's a phrase that means "having five iambs". TERRIFIC. Then I looked up "iamb" and it said they're a metrical foot, so that's, what, 30 centimetres?
T-Rex: Have we all learnt about sonnets yet?
T-Rex: Please say yes
Utahraptor: I think metrical means "regarding meter", not "in metric". Meter is a poem thing, right?
T-Rex: Then what's a foot??
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Okay, internet says feet are "a metrical unit that generates a line of verse". Maybe that's related?
T-Rex: MY internet said iambic comes from Iambe, the Greek goddess of verse. Because there's gods for that? But then it talked about accentual-syllabic verse?
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Attention: sonneteers!!
T-Rex (punchline): You win, you get all the sonnets for yourself / I've put my dictionary back up on the shelf / Is this a sonnet? I don't know / Hidey hidey hidey ho


T-Rex: Computers are perfect calculating machines! That means that once I write a rad website (WHICH I DID), then I now am good FOR LIFE. It will run forever!
T-Rex: Hooray for computers!!
Narrator: LATER:
Dromiceiomimus: Oh hey, T-Rex, the site you wrote is down: looks like the server filled itself up with log files.
T-Rex: Dang it! Okay well I guess I'll just erase everything and restart. That fixes things, right?
T-Rex: Like, always?
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Site's down! Looks like a hardware failure or three!
T-Rex: DANG IT
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Site's busted! Looks like hackers used some unpatched vulnerabilities. Now your website says "HI, I DO ALL THIS EMBARRASSING SEX STUFF" and then there's a list of fun things you do. I had no idea!
T-Rex: DANG IT!!
Narrator: LATER, T-REX GETS A CONCERNED CALL FROM HIS MOTHER:
T-Rex (punchline): Mom, I am speaking to you on speakerphone! And may I be the first to assure you: that list is, at best, only PARTIALLY accurate


God: IT'S TIME FOR ROMANCE TIPS WITH T-REX
T-Rex: Yes! Today is the day for some tips on how to convince yourself that no matter what you'll never find anyone bett-
T-Rex: Okay! Today is the day for some tips on being romantic!
T-Rex: Flowers are nice, for all sexes and genders! They're pretty and also - smell pretty? Also! It can be romantic to tell someone that you love them. Also, um.
T-Rex: Okay, so here's the thing. Probably there is someone out there who's better suited with you. The odds of you both having found the ONE person who's absolutely best for you, no matter what system you use to rank "bestness", are pretty small.
T-Rex: But!
Utahraptor: But?
T-Rex: BUT.
T-Rex: Let's say you're happy with person A (95% perfect) and you meet person B who is 99% perfect. It doesn't make sense to leave person A for B if you've been with them for years! You lose out on all your shared history, and that's like a times two multiplier!
Utahraptor: Romance?
T-Rex: Romance with a times two multiplier!
God: OKAY SO
God: ROMANCE TIPS WITH T-REX WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA
T-Rex (punchline): ...Righty-o


T-Rex: Descartes was a dude who wrote "Cogito ergo sum" which means "I think, therefore I am". PRETTY NEAT, cats and kittens!
T-Rex: But also... PRETTY FLAWED??
T-Rex: The whole deal with "I think, therefore I am" is that Descartes is all "DAAAAAAMN, I can't be sure of ANYTHING! My senses are flawed. All I know for sure is I keep STRESSIN' about this stuff!" and then his girlfriend is all "If you're so hung up on this then you must exist, huh baby?" and Descartes is all "Yes. That is true. I will write this down in Latin."
T-Rex: That is how it went down.
Utahraptor: So what's the problem, besides your unnecessary storytelling?
T-Rex: Descartes' girlfriend!
T-Rex: She's making a huge logical leap! It's indisputable that thinking is going on, right, but we don't know for sure that Descartes is doing the thinking! All we know for sure is that thinking is going on.
Utahraptor: I agree!
T-Rex: R-Really?
Off panel: Yeah! You can't have thinking in a vacuum, so SOMETHING must exist if there's thinking going on...
T-Rex and off panel: ...but to attribute that thinking to yourself just because you're aware of it is an awful big leap for a skeptic to make!
T-Rex (punchline): OH MY GOODNESS HOW DID WE JUST DO THAT


T-Rex: I know tons about my favourite fictional characters. I can talk about them at length!
T-Rex: And I do! I really do!
T-Rex: But I don't know anything about what's going on with my body!!
T-Rex: I'm serious. If purple poops start coming out of this bad boy tomorrow morning, I will have NO IDEA what's wrong. All I'll be able to do is walk into a doctor's office and say, "Sup? Listen, purple poops are coming out of my bum: awesome, or cause for concern? Here's some money, so let me know!"
Dromiceiomimus: That's what we have doctors for, T-Rex! They let us know our problems for money!
T-Rex: But that's my point! We ALL have bodies!
Utahraptor: So we... should all be doctors?
T-Rex: Yes! Shouldn't we? If you were a robot, wouldn't you store a copy of your blueprints and repair manual in your cyber brain somewhere? Doesn't that just seem... REASONABLE?
Utahraptor: Man! If I were a robot, a lot of things would be different.
Urahraptor: [starts daydreaming]
[Utahraptor's daydream]
Off panel: GREETINGS T-REX // I AM YOUR FRIEND UTAHROBOTER
T-Rex: I'm made of meat, so I get weaker AND forgetful as I get older!!
Off panel: YET I WILL LIVE FOREVER // HOW IRONIC
Off panel: IRON-IC // GET IT
Off panel (punchline): FUN FACT // I WAS ALSO PROGRAMMED FOR JOKES


T-Rex: Am I ever prepared for a mid-life crisis! I'm seriously ready.
T-Rex: BRING. IT. ON!
Dromiceiomimus: But what makes you think you're so prepared?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm awesome! If I wake up one morning and think "What have I ever done with my life, have I ever really accomplished anything, OH GOD", then that thought will be followed by "Wait I forgot how awesome I am! NEVERMIND."
Dromiceiomimus: What if that second thought doesn't come though?
T-Rex: Impossible! A mid-life crisis is a crisis of confidence, and if there's one thing I've got, it's confidence!
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: YES. Confidence in who I am, what I've done and where I'm going. And if there's two things I've got, it's confidence AND a bunch of burgers to eat when I get home! So do you wanna come over and eat burgers tonight or what, Utahraptor?
Utahraptor: Sure!
T-Rex: Excellent!
T-Rex (punchline): If there's THREE things I've got, it's confidence, burgers, and the mantra that "As bad as today gets, soon my stomach will be brimming with beef."


T-Rex: I admit it: a few days ago, I was tripping substantial balls over the fact that light takes time to reach me from across the room. But I'm better now! I am NO LONGER tripping balls, substantial OR otherwise.
T-Rex: Because I've realized: it takes time for my eyes to react to light, too!
T-Rex: And it takes time for the electrical impulses of THAT reaction to travel to my brain, and it takes more time for my brain to react to THOSE. Basically, the idea of an externally consistent personal "now" is ridiculous and impossible, and I was a fool to try!
Dromiceiomimus: Especially since sound takes time to travel too!
T-Rex: Exactly! I'm now TOTALLY COOL with that.
Utahraptor: It's not just sound and light: gravity has a travel time too!
T-Rex: W-
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Nothing travels faster than light, right? What little gravitational attraction there is between us is time-delayed too.
T-Rex: Okay, but we're only talking a few nanoseconds! I'm not gonna trip b-
Utahraptor: The sun's over 8 light minutes away, T-Rex.
Off panel: I hate to be the one to tell you this, but - the Earth doesn't go around the sun. The Earth goes around wherever the sun was 8 minutes ago.
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR
T-Rex: I'M
T-Rex (punchline): TRIPPING BALLS I JUST FOUND OUT I HAD


T-Rex: I am a sensible guy who does sensible things. My favourite expression is "Fellows! Let us be SENSIBLE." However!
T-Rex: I am not all guys!
T-Rex: Some guys wake up in the morning, and they're crazy. They don't know how many men they'll punch that day. They write in their diary and say, "Dear Diary, anything could happen today." Then they pause thoughtfully, adding "I don't even know." Some guys get to wake up in minimum-security holding cells, laughing. Some guys get to think about it when you ask them what city they lived in last year!
Utahraptor: The romance of the rebel?
T-Rex: A little, I guess!
Utahraptor: Well if it's any consolation, you're not THAT sensible. You've done tons of crazy things! You just THINK you're sensible because you always did them for reasons you believed were rational.
T-Rex: That's exactly it: I never surprise myself! When will I do crazy things? When will I wake up in jail and laugh?
T-Rex: Hah! It would be awesome if there was a clock wipe right now, cutting to me three minutes later, behind bars and shouting "I believe there's nothing particularly funny about my new circumstances!"
Off panel (punchline): Not really


T-Rex: So! Life proceeds, despite the fact that I've got the freakiest neighbours ever. Who wants to live next door to sinister raccoons and cephalopods?
T-Rex: Not me!
T-Rex: The ONLY advantage I can think of is that it'll be cool on Hallowe'en. That's it!
T-Rex: And that's not even much of an advantage, actually!
T-Rex: Not even!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, did you ever think that maybe they're just as scared of you as you are of them?
T-Rex: Hah!
Utahraptor: Seriously! You could be quite imposing to someone who doesn't know you!
T-Rex: Man, these animals are WITHOUT FEAR. I don't see how acting like I'm not afraid will help things!
Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
Off panel: ARE YOU AFRAID OF US, NEIGHBOUR?
T-Rex: No way dudes! Nothing you can say will scare me!
Off panel: COME BLEED WITH US
Off panel (punchline): COME BLEED WITH US, T-REX


T-Rex: Are you there, God? It's me, -
God: YO RIGHT HERE
God: WHAT'S GOING ON T-REX
T-Rex: You know, not much!
T-Rex: I was just wondering if You'd heard any good jokes lately.
God: MAN NOPE CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE
T-Rex: Really? You haven't heard ONE good joke?
T-Rex: Maybe even a joke that was just alright?
Utahraptor: T-Rex?
Utahraptor: Who were you talking to, just now?
T-Rex: Oh, I was just chatting up God to see if He had any good jokes - but no dice!
Utahraptor: I'm not sure we'd even be able to UNDERSTAND a joke God would make!
T-Rex: Come to think of it, yeah! I bet He'd do something lame like making all of the Universe the joke or something!
God: AW GUYS
God (punchline): YOU GOT ME


T-Rex: You know what I'm tired of feeling?
God: EMOTIONS
T-Rex: Pain!
T-Rex: (Emotions too.)
T-Rex: But seriously, guys! Why do we need pain?
T-Rex: It hurts!
T-Rex: And you can't turn it off. It's like a phone that won't stop ringing whenever I'm hurt, and when I answer it, it's always friggin' Pain calling and he won't get off the line. I say "Yeah, I get it Pain, I stubbed my toe." and he says "Yeah, it still hurts like a bitch. Can I say bitch? It really hurts, T-Rex", and I say "Look, Pain. I know." and he stays on the line and I say "Pain, you've gotta find other people to call. You've got to get other hobbies."
T-Rex: I'd prefer looking down and seeing that my toe is stubbed to, um, EXCRUCIATING PAIN.
Utahraptor: So you want leprosy.
T-Rex: Uh NO, I didn't say I want my LIMBS to fall off.
Utahraptor: Leprosy doesn't make your limbs fall off!! You lose SENSATION in your body, so you can do things like accidentally crush your fingers and not notice. Hey, how's the centuries-old prejudice over there? Pretty uninformed? Pretty BIASED?
T-Rex: Utahraptor! You were totally a jerk to me just now! And if you're hoping I'm going to shout after you that "Now I wish my HEART couldn't feel pain", I'm not!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm just thinking it, okay??


Narrator: COMPRESSED LITERATURE COMICS today's literature:
Narrator: THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU
T-Rex: One day a dude lands on an island run by a biologist specializing in vivisection!
T-Rex: The other "people" there are weirdly furry and animal-like, which leads the dude to think "Wow, I wonder if this doctor, who specializes in grafting different animal parts together, is using now-discredited ideas from the 1800s of how that works (because this is when this story was written) to suppress the 'bestial' aspects of animals and thereby 'elevate' them to our level??" and SURPRISE, that's what's happening.
Utahraptor: And then things go wrong and the animals turn against their masters?
T-Rex: YOU KNOW IT!
T-Rex: It's Jurassic Park, but HERE animals are created by a dino named "Dr. Moreau" in the PRESENT, rather than the science fiction of dinosaurs being created by humans in the distant future under the supposition that we all go extinct in some sort of "catastrophic event"?? Hah! I'd like to see THAT!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Dear audio diary: great news! I keep setting up ironic comeuppance but it keeps not happening so I can only assume we live forever??
T-Rex (punchline): So, that's nice


T-Rex: What's for dinner tonight, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well T-Rex, I don't know!
T-Rex: What would you like, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I always choose what's for dinner, T-Rex! You decide tonight.
Dromiceiomimus: ?
T-Rex: Hmm... in that case, T-Rex, let's have nachos tonight! It'll be fun!
Utahraptor: My friend, I'm afraid you've gone insane! You're coo-coo crazy!
T-Rex: Why's that?
Utahraptor: You're talking to yourself like you are two different people, and it is a societal norm that people who do that are insane.
T-Rex: Don't talk to me about societal norms! We walk around naked!
T-Rex (punchline): Observe!


T-Rex: You guys, what if reincarnation is real?!
God: T-REX
T-Rex: I'm serious, what if it is??
T-Rex: What if we had clear and unassailable proof that everyone who dies gets a do-over?
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe people would be less sad at funerals?
T-Rex: LESS SAD AT FUNERALS?? I mean, okay, yes, but you know what else happens? THE WORLD CHANGES FOREVER. Projects that would take lifetimes to complete now become easily achievable! YOU CAN TRAVEL THE WORLD FOR FREE JUST BY DYING, WHICH IS LIKE, REALLY EASY TO DO. Death becomes a brief time-out instead of getting kicked from the game!
Utahraptor: You're treating this like a video game?
T-Rex: Of course!
T-Rex: They're our best evidence for what happens when people respawn! They prove that people have A LOT OF FUN.
Utahraptor: Yes, I can't wait to live in a world where adults get killed by laser blasters and then two days later newborn babies are running around trying to get their comeuppance with other laser blasters.
T-Rex: Come on Utahraptor, OBVIOUSLY that's a ridiculous situation.
T-Rex: ...Wait, no, OBVIOUSLY that's an amazing situation! OH MY GOD. I'll be back later!
T-Rex (punchline): I need to go write some fanfiction about my own ideas!!


T-Rex: Who would win in a fight, Superman or Batman?
T-Rex: The answer is "Batman"!
T-Rex: Anyone who doubts this need only remember that Batman is really smart, and that they're probably wrong.
Dromiceiomimus: Superman has strength!
T-Rex: Batman has BATMAN SKILLS.
Utahraptor: Man, Superman could kill Batman before Bats even knew the fight had started!
T-Rex: Oh, he'd know.
Utahraptor: Only because you're assuming he's omniscient. The dude has to sleep! Superman could laser him from orbit while he's having nappy times.
T-Rex: Batman doesn't have "nappy times"!!
Utahraptor: Sure he does!
Off panel: Every time he sleeps he puts a sign on his door that says, "Warning: Nappy Times! Enter only if you have a valid passport to dreamland!"
T-Rex: OH GOD
T-Rex (punchline): OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS NEVER BEEN SO ENDANGERED


Off panel: Great party, T-Rex! Hey, do you have any more chips?
T-Rex: Sorry guys, those were the last!
God: HEY I BROUGHT SOME POTATO CHIPS T-REX
T-Rex: God! You came!
God: THAT'S RIGHT SORRY I'M LATE BUT THESE ARE SOME GOOD CHIPS
God: CHICKEN FLAVOUR
T-Rex: Classy! Glad you could make it!
Dromiceiomimus: Who are you talking to, T-Rex?
T-Rex: God! But it seems that AS USUAL only I can hear Him!
God: SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT I'VE GOT A GREAT JOKE FOR YOU TO TELL
Utahraptor: Got any new jokes, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Y-Yes?
God: THIS'LL BE GREAT TELL HIM A SKELETON WENT INTO A BAR AND ORDERED A BEER AND A MOP
T-Rex: Utahraptor, a skeleton went into a bar and ordered a beer and a mop!
Utahraptor: To clean up the beer; yeah, I get it. That's not a very good joke, T-Rex!
God: SORRY IT'S NORMALLY BETTER THAN THAT
God: I WAS JUST TRYING OUT SOMETHING NEW
T-Rex (punchline): Dude, try it out somewhere else!


T-Rex: I bet that I could be an amazing ballet dancer. In fact... yes. Wait. Yes!
T-Rex: Yes, I'm certain of it!
Dromiceiomimus: Ballet is hard and takes years of training, T-Rex! To suggest that you could barge onstage during Swan Lake and just join in is actually kind of offensive to ballet dancers.
T-Rex: Oh, I know! That's not what I meant. I meant, "I bet that, HAD I SPENT YEARS TRAINING, I could be an amazing ballet dancer".
Dromiceiomimus: Ah.
Utahraptor: But it takes more than training!
T-Rex: Oh, of course!
T-Rex: My true meaning was, "I bet that, had I the body type, circumstances, inclination, talent AND training, I could be an amazing ballet dancer."
Utahraptor: Ah. Well. I guess that would indeed be the case.
T-Rex: Yep!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX IS A BALLET DANCER!
T-Rex (punchline): Well, *I* bet that I could be an amazing - um, guy who walks around and talks shit up?


T-Rex: What is the meaning of life? By this I mean, how should I best live my life?
Narrator: THE MEANING OF LIFE
T-Rex: More concretely: what can I do NOW that is meaningful and justified and purposeful and not - pointlessly absurd?
Dromiceiomimus: These are big questions, my friend!
T-Rex: I know, Dromiceiomimus, I know! But I'm sick of that being used as an excuse. I am demanding BIG ANSWERS. There must be some way to arrive at a solution!
Utahraptor: I don't know if there is, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well - I have an idea.
T-Rex: Okay: so I don't know what the meaning of life is; fine. But, I do know that others MIGHT. So, inductively, the only thing I can do is try to make life easier for these other people, until such a time that they figure it out and let me know!
Utahraptor: So you become a dentist?
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex (punchline): What?


T-Rex: Someone at my house finished off a bag of milk, and then put it back in the fridge without replacing it with a new bag!
T-Rex: That's so annoying!
T-Rex: Also, it's very confusing since I live alone!
T-Rex: What do you think, Dromiceiomimus? Am I going crazy? Am I finishing off the milk and then COMPLETELY FORGETTING ABOUT IT?
Dromiceiomimus: It seems unlikely!
T-Rex: What else could it be? Is someone breaking into my house just to drink my milk? I don't really mind, I guess - I'd just like to know.
Utahraptor: How come these things always happen to you?
T-Rex: It's not my fault!
Utahraptor: Well, I'm just pointing out that across all these wacky situations, you're the one element of continuity.
T-Rex: Why would I screw myself over by not putting a new bag of milk back? That's crazy!
God: I USUALLY DON'T PUT A NEW BAG BACK EITHER
T-Rex: Was it you?!
God: NO JUST-
God (punchline): VOLUNTEERING INFORMATION


Narrator: INCORRECT HOMOPHONE COMICS
T-Rex: Two words that are homophones sound the same but mean different things!
T-Rex: For instance: the word "awful" (really bad) and the word "offal" (butchered entrails)!
T-Rex: To begin: my stomping on this manner is a sorted little affair! Take soulless in the fact that at leased ewe are knot being chaste as well!
Dromiceiomimus: Why don't you chews to do something else? That would be good gnus to me!
T-Rex: I will here nun of it!
Utahraptor: I don't get it!
T-Rex: I'm saying weird homophones!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but you're not writing them down, so it sounds normal. Pretty normal, anyway. It sounds a little like you're speaking with a weird accent.
T-Rex: I was speaking in hilariously inappropriate homophones! IT WAS EXTREMELY HILARIOUS.
Narrator (punchline): THE END


T-Rex: SECRETS.
T-Rex: Do we keep them in order to keep relationships running smoothly?
T-Rex: Do we share them to cement friendships? Treasure them because we value knowledge, and if the knowledge is privileged then it's even MORE valuable? Create them because we are all hopelessly duplicitous and our public faces and private personas can never be reconciled??
Utahraptor: Perhaps we create them out of shame?
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: Those who keep their failings secret appear more perfect, and so we too keep our shames private, in order to bring ourselves up to this impossible standard!
Utahraptor: And when failings are revealed, we react with judgement, fearing any sympathy might arouse interest in our own secrets!
T-Rex: [thinks] No-one must know I peed on the wall
Off panel: [thinks] No-one must know I peed on the wall
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] No-one must know I bet Utahraptor peed on the wall though


God: T-REX LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A GIANT HEAP OF SAND AND I REMOVE ONE GRAIN OF IT AT A TIME
T-Rex: Ooh, let's!!
God: CLEARLY WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE GRAIN OF SAND LEFT IT'S NOT A HEAP ANYMORE
T-Rex: Clearly!
God: AHA MY FRIEND BUT WHEN PRECISELY DID IT SWITCH FROM HEAP TO NON-HEAP
T-Rex: I dunno! At some fuzzy point it would switch for most observers from "heap" to, say, "small pile", and there we can draw the line. Language isn't that precise.
God: LISTEN THIS IS A CLASSIC PARADOX THAT EUBULIDES OF MILETUS CAME UP WITH OVER 2000 YEARS AGO
God: YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR MIND BLOWN NOW OKAY
T-Rex: Sounds kinda dumb to me!
Utahraptor: What does?
T-Rex: The point at which a shrinking heap of sand becomes a non-heap. Clearly I'm supposed to struggle with an arbitrary threshold, because piles on either side of it look much the same. But it's just language! Look at statistical usage of the word "heap", decide using that average, end of story.
T-Rex: Oh snap, philosophers! Did T-Rex just totally school you with his statistically-based descriptivist approach to semantics? IT APPEARS THAT HE TOTALLY DID!!
T-Rex (punchline): It also appears he's speaking in the third person because he's so impressed with his awesome self!


T-Rex: Is there any conceivable better form of music than out-of-genre cover songs? The answer is no! The FULL answer is "No, there is nothing better! I love them all SO MUCH! I can never take this back."
Narrator: T-REX LOVES OUT-OF-GENRE COVER SONGS
Narrator: they're great
T-Rex: They're great because say you love a particular hip hop song, but wouldn't you love it EVEN MORE if it was an opera? Yes, you would! Also, wouldn't you love arias ten times better as gangsta rap songs? Here again, the answer is yes. I don't know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended, but I accept it, and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form!
Utahraptor: Isn't it just the novelty of it that appeals to you though?
T-Rex: That's part of it, true!
T-Rex: I like the feeling of looking in on an alternate universe: that sense of familiarity, altered but recognizable. But even without it, some are just really great songs that stand on their own!
Utahraptor: Let's listen to one! Give me your absolute favourite.
Narrator: SOON:
Off panel: This is the theme song to Cheers, played on steel drums and - what is that, a theremin?
T-Rex (punchline): It's the song I hear in my head whenever I close my eyes!


Narrator: IT'S "MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START A BRAND NEW LIFE" WEDNESDAY
T-Rex: Oh sweet, I was waiting for this one.
T-Rex: ATTENTION, EVERYONE I KNOW: y'all are being traded up for strangers, suckachumps!
Dromiceiomimus: I get the appeal of this fantasy, T-Rex, but it kinda died last decade, didn't it?
T-Rex: What? No, the dream is still alive! I'm going to move to a new town and REINVENT MYSELF. A fresh start!
Dromiceiomimus: So what, you think your old friends WON'T be able to find you online? Did we all get super dumb at Google?
Dromiceiomimus: Because I SURE DIDN'T GET SUPER DUMB AT GOOGLE.
T-Rex: I'll delete all my accounts! Social media will be dead to me!
Utahraptor: Where have I heard that before?
Utahraptor: Oh right, only from EVERYONE ON FACEBOOK EVER. And yet, Facebook still has 1/2 a billion people on it! WEIRD, HUH?
T-Rex: Fine, I'm moving away, deleting everything AND legally changing my name. Bye, it's impossible to find me now!!
Narrator: LATER, IT'S "WOW MOVING IS SUPER EXPENSIVE AND I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO SPEND $137 ON THAN CHANGING MY NAME" THURSDAY:
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex (punchline): ...DVDs of old TV shows mostly, plus, PLUS, I bought lots of slightly-irregular chocolate in bulk


T-Rex: Alright! New novel: done! This one is a romance, and is called:
T-Rex: "Pretzels In A Lady's Lap"!
T-Rex: It's named after a particularly striking scene from the book! We’re at a party, and a young man accidentally spills pretzels, as he walks by, into the titular Lady’s lap! She looks up: eyes meet, bosoms - on both sides - heave, passions smoulder, and, perhaps... romance blossoms?
Utahraptor: Hey, what’s so sensual about pretzels?
T-Rex: Dude!
Utahraptor: No, really! They’re dry and salty.
T-Rex: I’ve always found them to be pretty sensual.
Utahraptor: I’m pretty sure you’re the only one!
T-Rex: Really? Huh! Nobody else finds pretzels stimulating?
T-Rex (punchline): Well, this has been quite the anagnorisis (a moment of recognition or discovery)!


T-Rex: Hey, raise your hand if you ever thought it'd be nice if strangers would just like you a lot for no reason!
T-Rex: ...What's that?
T-Rex: EVERY HAND IN THE WORLD JUST GOT RAISED??
T-Rex: Good news, people attached to those hands: this thing is possible! All you need is CHARISMA. And it turns out that's really easy! Just get great at conversation, eye contact, confidence, body language, humour, engagement, and at having a fun, approachable, and empathic presence!
T-Rex: Tada!
Utahraptor: Is that all?
T-Rex: Yep! It's THAT easy!
T-Rex: Those nine skills are LITERALLY all you need for likeability! And each can take work, sure, but ANYONE can learn one of them in a decade, tops. So by the time you're ninety, you'll be ready for ANY social situation the world can throw at you!!
Utahraptor: Assuming I start working on my charm as a baby.
T-Rex: Oh yes. If you were born an uncharismatic baby, then it's MUCH simpler to not care if people like you!! You will be beyond fear, beyond shame; society will find itself impotent against your fully-realized self.
T-Rex (punchline): You will, at last, be free


Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS STRESSFUL PROBLEM GENERATOR
T-Rex: Need a stressful problem? NOT A PROBLEM. Check it!
T-Rex: Your problem is a(n)...
T-Rex: flooded / dying / explosive / poisonous / vengeful / understated / parasitic
T-Rex: basement / god / bicycle / friend / bus / secret / relationship / sex move / skeleton
Dromiceiomimus: My problem is an understated sex move?
Dromiceiomimus: ...
Dromiceiomimus: ...Yeah, makes sense.
Utahraptor: Apparently, MY problem is a poisonous basement!
T-Rex: Oh no!
T-Rex: Well now you need to: walk it off / deal with it / ignore it forever / move to a new town where nobody knows you.
Utahraptor: I'll take the latter. Goodbye forever, T-Rex!
T-Rex: We had a good run!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: I'm back! The problem was fake and my basement is just a regular basement!
T-Rex and off panel (punchline): Yaaaaay, imagination
