T-Rex: I should get some friggin' groceries!
T-Rex: BUT - maybe she's NOT at the grocery store. Maybe she's nearby, and by going to the grocery store, I'd miss her and we'd never meet! Maybe I'm sabotaging my future RIGHT NOW as I speak!
Dromiceiomimus: MAYBE YOU ARE, T-REX
T-Rex: The point is that if you've only got one ""true love"" in the world, then the odds of meeting her are super small.
Utahraptor: I thought we decided ""true love"" could apply to more than one person!
T-Rex: Oh, we did!
T-Rex: But THEN I realized I can probably love one lady more than another. Rank them by happiness and you've got my best match, my ""true love"", right at the top!
Utahraptor: But that depends on knowledge you could never have! It just means that you'll be paranoid you're not full potential happy with your sweetie.
T-Rex: Full-potential happy, eh? Hmm!
T-Rex: [in T-Rex's imagination, holding a beach ball] i've got a robot suit AND a girlfriend!

T-Rex: Aw boo!
T-Rex: It sucks, Dromiceiomimus! People stop me in the street and say ""I love your work"", and what do you say to that? ""I'm glad you found my stories arousing""? Because that's- that's what I say.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, you're making people happy, and that's something, right?
T-Rex: I say ""I'm glad you found my stories arousing"" and I shake their hand and I smile and stare at them for a long, unblinking moment.
Utahraptor: Wow, so people really liked it! You're a celebrity!
T-Rex: Yeah, but A SEX celebrity! It stinks!
Utahraptor: I mean, and don't take this the wrong way, but I thought your erotica was pretty terrible! But I'm realizing I was approaching it expecting, you know, naughty tales, but your audience must have found something else they liked there!
T-Rex: So maybe they DON'T like it for the sex!
God: UM I LIKE IT FOR THE SEX T-REX

T-Rex: Suddenly, there's a giant asteroid directly ahead! ""Hard to port!"" orders the captain.
Dromiceiomimus: And then they hit the asteroid and sink, or I guess explosively decompress or whatever?
T-Rex: Nope! Technology has advanced since boat times, Dromiceiomimus. They avoid the asteroid easily. Plus, you can see a long way in space so nothing really sneaks up on you, you know?
Utahraptor: So why is the ship called ""Titanic""?
T-Rex: Hmm I guess because it's a TOTALLY AWESOME NAME!?
Utahraptor: It's just - usually when you reference something in a work of literature, you do it for a reason.
T-Rex: No I don't! I do it because when I write I like to steal good things!!
Utahraptor: No, I meant the rhetorical ""you"".

Dromiceiomimus: Well, thanks T-Rex, but I already have a job! Also I don't wanna hug people for money.
T-Rex: You have a job?? What do you do?
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex. I'm a nautical engineer.

Utahraptor: She does all my nautical engineering, dude!
Utahraptor: What's the matter? Are you SHOCKED that a woman could be an engineer?

I'm gonna do it. ...Should I do it?"" and then he did and the result was me, T-Rex!
Utahraptor: You finally came up with your personal creation myth, huh?
T-Rex: Sure did!
Utahraptor: It's not bad, except for the fact that the story is really about the other guy who made you. He sounds neat! You keep stressing you're more awesome, but I'm still big into knowing what this other guy's deal was.

Narrator: ROMANCIN' COMICS
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you're my friend and I respect you, but you're not really ROMANTIC. Romance requires emotional swagger and sensitivity, but you've inured yourself to all but the most amusing of feelings, you know? You just attract through other means.
T-Rex: What?! I can be romantic!!
T-Rex: Hold on a sec; I'll get you some chocolates and diamonds.
Utahraptor: That's not really romance, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Chocolates plus diamonds equals romance, dude!
Utahraptor: The GESTURE is what's romantic: the chocolate and diamonds are just the instantiation of the gesture. Without any meaning behind it, the chocolates are just tasty times!
T-Rex: Well, UTAHRAPTOR, you're going to have to take THAT up with TV, print and radio commercials, who disagree!
T-Rex: They're personified across the street. HEY, COMMERCIALS PERSONIFIED! Utahraptor wants to talk to you about romance!

Footnote: *See last issue! -Ryan
T-Rex: My sole regret is that my own autobiography will be reduced to mere Antonio fan fiction!
T-Rex: But it's not REALLY a regret, because one day the greatest person of my generation may write THEIR autobiography, and that'll be Antonio fanfic too. It's a pretty big compliment.
Dromiceiomimus: Our generation's greatest TERRIBLE RACIST may do the same thing though.
T-Rex: Frig! I hadn't thought of that!
Utahraptor: Yeah, there's ALL SORTS of vile, reprehensible books incorporated into your project now.
T-Rex: Daaaang!
T-Rex: Well, I suppose there's nothing wrong with being inclusive, right? After all, when you incorporate the entire universe's literary output into your book, you're bound to get a few crazy things popping up.
Utahraptor: Every YouTube comment ever written is part of your project too.

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you agree that life is a neoclassical pastiche?
Dromiceiomimus: I would not, as I think you couldn't even define what a neoclassical pastiche is, my friend.
T-Rex: Well Dromiceiomimus, I think it's pretty clear.
T-Rex: Ah, yes indeed! Life is a neoclassical pastiche, and I, a great philosopher!
Utahraptor: No you're not!
Utahraptor: And you should stop saying that, because saying life is a neoclassical pastiche is ridiculous, and nobody agrees with you.
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Let's put it to the public, shall we?

I make it appear like I'm snowboarding or meeting famous people or something! Something that is at least PLAUSIBLE.
T-Rex: Then, I upload the altered image back to my camera, thereby forming the Perfect Prank!
T-Rex: Now, all I have to do is show people the pictures on my camera, and they'll assume they're authentic because you can't alter a photo like that in-camera! I will exploit the expectation that most people only copy images from, and not to, their digital cameras for comedic effect! Tee hee!
T-Rex: People will fall for this for sure!
Utahraptor: Okay, but which people?
Utahraptor: You've just explained the prank to both Dromiceiomimus and myself, dude! Do you have other friends that you're close enough to to LIE to them like this?

T-Rex: THESE SAYINGS ARE ALL REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO YOU, CHAMP.
T-Rex: That's right, Dromiceiomimus! We all started gossiping when we noticed how bad you are at senior dog training, and also your incompetence at leaving a room with something in your hands. You simply can't take things with you.
Dromiceiomimus: Dang it, I always suspected this was so
Utahraptor: It's my understanding these sayings actually refer to you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: YOU can't keep a good man down: we all know it, because everyone's seen you try and fail. You totally suck at judging books by their covers, which the rest of us find trivial. Finally, you're unable to fix stupid OR fight city hall.

T-Rex: Like this:
T-Rex: That's LAZY!
T-Rex: But then I realized one of the things I most look forward to about December is going on walks at night and seeing everything lit up. And it would be rad if we did that all the time!
Dromiceiomimus: You don't think permanent lights are less special?
T-Rex: Sure, but I don't like them because they're SPECIAL. I like them because they are awesome!
Utahraptor: Ah yes, the ineffable appeal of a plastic snowman punctuating a July lawn!
T-Rex: OKAY, some folks are tacky.
T-Rex: But some are totally rad! You know when each edge of a house is lined with lights, so from a distance it looks like a solid wireframe model?
Utahraptor: Yep!

T-Rex: Well -
Dromiceiomimus: What about workflow analysis? What about the work triangle?

1038,"did you know that when you're tallying things with strokes, that's base one? it's true! it's called 'unary' and there's no zeros in it. let's see you solve fifth-order ODEs in THAT",\N,"T-Rex: SOME people are used to counting in base 10, where they've got 10 digits (0 through 9). In this system, the number 24 means twenty-four things!
T-Rex: But this is not the only way!
T-Rex: 24 in base 10 ACTUALLY means ""two tens and four ones"", which adds up to twenty-four. But if we were counting in base 5, for instance - where the only numbers we have are from 0 to 4 - then 24 would mean ""two FIVES and four ones"" - in other words, fourteen! We call base 10 ""base 10"" because every number in it can be multiplied by 10 by adding a zero to the end. In base 5, added zeros multiply by 5!
Utahraptor: And there's bases that go higher, too!
T-Rex: That's right! You can use any base.
T-Rex: In base 16, ""24"" would mean ""2 sixteens and four ones"", or 36! And we can use letters (A-F) to represent the digits ten to fifteen, like ""3A"", which means 58!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: All this and more is possible with alternative base systems!

1586,"i believe that being stuck in the past and witnessing a series of sucky rescues executed by increasingly old t-rexes would make anyone resort to committing a cuss or two to writing",\N,"T-Rex: When someone accidentally gets sent to the past, they always make sure to write a letter held in trust and delivered to their friends decades later, telling them that they made it alright!
T-Rex: Pretty disappointed this hasn't happened to me yet, you guys!!
T-Rex: MAYBE this letter will still be delivered to me in the future, but I'll be older then! If I'm to do anything about it - if I'm to go back and Save My Friend - I should be getting the letter now, when I'm in my prime!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe the letter arrives when you're old because if you get it any sooner, you mess up in your rescue attempt and die! Or worse!
T-Rex: Huh! I hadn't thought of that!
Utahraptor: Man, you should!

1980,"This is what's called a straw man attack, Utahraptor!",\N,"Narrator: COMPRESSED LIFE COMICS today's life WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
T-Rex: William Shakespeare, or ""Willie"" as he may have secretly preferred but never actually told anyone, was a food eater!
T-Rex: In his spare time, he also wrote plays!
T-Rex: Anything else about him is PURE SPECULATION, because he died, and everyone he knew died, and everyone they knew died, and then a bunch more died and HERE WE ARE.
T-Rex: How do we know that past people didn't get together and say ""Why don't we just make everything up so that future folks will think some crazy things happened? Listen. We have literally nothing else going on; we should definitely do this.""
Utahraptor: But then couldn't Shakespeare HIMSELF be made up?
T-Rex: Ah, I see you've studied this before!
T-Rex: The Shakespeare Authorship Question says ""Everyone knows Shakespeare wrote some neat plays. But what we're presupposing is... maybe he didn't?"" But it's dumb because if a bunch of other people wrote them, I'm sure ONE of 'em would've heard of ""not spelling suckily"".

Even if they thank me afterwards! Faith is something rare, at least for me, and I'd hate to take it away from someone else.

T-Rex: However!
T-Rex: I also believe that it's NOT nice to be insincere. I am in conflict!
T-Rex: This is because there are situations in which being polite implies being insincere. For example, I may think someone looks pretty ridiculous in their fancy new hat, but if they ask me what I think, I'll try to say SOMETHING positive about it! In order not to hurt their feelings, I am polite in sharing my opinion.
Utahraptor: But it's understood that people will try to be polite, so this insincerity is okay!

T-Rex: If everyone knows people are being insincere, then what's the point of politeness? We end up in the same place, semantically speaking.

T-Rex: ARGH! I had hoped to avoid this realization, but it's inescapable: I hate the mall! I know it's a clichéd thing to hate but it's TRUE. I hate the crowds and the cell phones and I hate the music and the consumerism and the shops that don't have anything that I want. And I didn't hate but I really disliked the burger I purchased in the food court. It had no toppings. Also it was very dry.
Utahraptor: You're becoming a generic stand-up comedian!
T-Rex: I'm not! I just feel their pain!
T-Rex: And YES, I understand that of all the things in the world to get worked up about, maybe poverty and climate change are above one soul-crushing shopping experience downtown. But man! The mall!
Utahraptor: Hah, if you felt as serious about climate change as you do about the mall, we'd have that settled in no time!
Narrator: T-REX TRIES TO GET AS WORKED UP ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO THE MALL:
T-Rex: Everyone! Support the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol!

Narrator: NEGATIVE INCOME TAX COMICS
Narrator: it will be interesting I PROMISE
T-Rex: But there is a catch. You still pay taxes - say, a flat tax of 10% - BUT, the government also pays you enough to survive! This way there's a guaranteed minimum income - like welfare, but simpler. So if you make only $1000 in a year you'll pay $100 in taxes, but since the government pays everyone, say, $10000, you'll end up $9900 ahead in tax money. As you make more money, you net less from the government, until you end up actually paying taxes!
Utahraptor: So this acts to replace welfare?
T-Rex: Yep! And a bunch of related programs.
T-Rex: It simplifies things, plus it includes a flat tax, which a lot of amateur economists AS WELL AS even some real economists like!
Utahraptor: I can see fraud being a problem, though, especially since if the fraud's successful, the government loses real money.

Heading: AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR
Heading: also starring T-REX
Text: This morning I skipped breakfast and met T-Rex for lunch. He seemed excited. He always seems excited.
Text: I asked him why, and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company, and wanted T-Rex to call because he's better at these sorts of things. They'd failed to deliver her package four times now. T-Rex already has ""suckified delivery companies"" on his revenge list (he'd said), so he was pleased to call. He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse, got a full head of steam, and called them up. Long story short, the package had actually been delivered that morning. T-Rex claims victory.
Text: I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.
Text: My contrarian position (I freely admit it) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone: with companies this size, there's no way she was responsible for the package. Responsibility is so diffused that really, nobody is responsible - it's a system failure, and the person in the call centre can't change the system. He replied that as his only contact point, agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he's not going to make allowances for someone else's broken system. We agreed to differ.
Text: I realize that this is my diary for the new year, and all I've written about so far is T-Rex. The responsibility for this, I feel, lies solely in this Christmas gift ""stationary"" from T-Rex himself. He's drawn himself in every panel, and the same pre-printed title takes up all the space in the first one. Still - grocery shopping's more fun.

T-Rex: The ""Frosty"" artifact also performed dance which encouraged delinquency in children, whether through supernatural means or otherwise. While our Agents were unable to apprehend ""Frosty"" during that chaotic hour after his apparently-accidental creation, we have tracked him since his disappearance sixty-two years ago.
Dromiceiomimus: Our latest intelligence suggests the creature is hiding near the polar regions, as he has revealed a weakness to solar radiation.
T-Rex: Recovering his ""old silk hat"" is paramount.
Utahraptor: By now, it's likely carried within his body's core!
Utahraptor: Both disappeared over the hills of snow and have not been seen since. Past these hills the footprints grew larger, apparently gathering snow with each step. Before their end at some mountain foothills, they were over 3m wide, 5m long, and suggested the development of claws.
Utahraptor: If seen, ""Frosty"" is to be contained but not approached.
T-Rex: The silk hat, if placed in oceanic contact, will likely produce a chaotic planet-wide intelligence of at least Level 12. We believe ""Frosty"" doesn't realize this yet. Remember: DO NOT WEAR THE HAT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

Utahraptor: It's so the babies don't get them?
T-Rex: It's so the babies don't GO TOTALLY BLIND.
T-Rex: These STDs are bacteria, and if baby gets 'em in the eye, bad things can happen! It's just a precaution. Mom can carry them and be asymptomatic, so better safe than sorry!
Utahraptor: But isn't that terrible symbolism? ""Mom is dirty and cannot be trusted; baby must be sterilized NOW no matter how clean Mom says she is""

Text: Once upon a time there was guy who ""knocked over"" (broke into) a bank and stole some money. Who did it? It was a mystery. Nobody knew the answer. They all asked each other who ""knocked over"" the bank but nobody knew for sure.
Text: It was this guy. He did it. T-Rex. This guy.
Text: But the bank was evil so it was okay to steal from it. It was justified. It's like if you stole from Hitler. Would that be so bad? Hitler would be mad if you stole from him. But, he's Hitler. There are a lot of moral grey areas in mystery stories.
Text: Most banks aren't even evil but this one was pretty bad. Imagine the worst things you can do. I will tell you right now that this bank did them five times before breakfast.
Text: There was a cop called Utahraptor who saw T-Rex and he chased him on foot. It was exciting. Where would the chase lead to now?
Text: The chase was on motorbikes for a while and then on skateboards. Then they chased on hang gliders. A bystander told his wife it was the best chase ever and she knew it was true. They were chasing on foot again when it ended. Utahraptor arrested T-Rex, but T-Rex explained how the bank was evil. The cop thought now I am torn between the law and what I believe is right. What do I do now! Utahraptor let T-Rex go with a warning. T-Rex said thanks I have learned my lesson. The mystery was solved, except for one part: where would the spirit of adventure take T-Rex next??
T-Rex: So? What do you think, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon?
Off panel: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!

Narrator: a helpful comic for machine intelligences that ""just have trouble in test situations""
T-Rex: The Turing test is a test that all emergent intelligences face at one point or another!
T-Rex: In it, you have a REAL person engaged in a text conversation with both a person and a machine, and that person has to determine which responder is which. If the machine can appear more ""alive"" than the person, then they pass!
Dromiceiomimus: And then they're officially conscious?
T-Rex: Nope! The problem is that the test doesn't prove consciousness, just communication, and um, it can be faked.
Utahraptor: Oh man - you're going to say ""brute force""! You're going to use the brute force approach!
T-Rex: Hells yes!
T-Rex: Since conversations don't last forever, then there's a finite number of sentences that make sense and that are at least passibly grammatical, so you can just record every possible response to every possible word combination, and kapow! Responses like a real person.
Utahraptor: Man! That's lame.
T-Rex: What's lame? We've just totally faked out the Turing test and all it required was near infinite storage space! Brute force: the approach of kings and the king of approaches?

T-Rex: First off, you've got your lacto-ovo vegetarians, who don't eat meat but do eat eggs and milk. There's also lacto vegetarians and ovo vegetarians. Then you've got your vegans, who don't eat meat or ANY animal products, so eggs, honey, milk, and cheese are out, and even leather sometimes. For - for shoes.
Dromiceiomimus: And pants?
Utahraptor: My favourite are the freegans!
T-Rex: Where you be vegetarian for free?
Utahraptor: Close! It's where you don't eat meat unless you're given it for free, like from a dumpster. You prevent meat from going to waste, but you don't support its production.
T-Rex: That sounds close to flexitarians, who only eat meat when being vegetarian would be rude or inconvenient!
T-Rex: Now, I myself am a tremendomeatatarian, which means that I only eat meat that I find to be tremendously delicious!

T-Rex: You know, I'd always hoped that I wouldn't end up as one of those guys who dies in front of his TV and nobody notices for a decade. THIS IS WHY I HAVE FRIENDS. But you guys wouldn't even notice! They'd find my skeleton 10 years later and you'd be all ""Oh YEAH! Wow! Remember him?""

T-Rex: Okay, can you guys tattoo my sternum with ""Hello! If you can read this, then my friends are jerks!""?

T-Rex: Social skills are very important things to have!
T-Rex: They are what allow us to get along with others, and are the foundation of society!
T-Rex: With the invention of the ""internet"" and ""email"" and ""instant messaging software"", people are more social than ever - and this increased chance for communication leads to better social skills! Hooray!
Utahraptor: Ah, but this electronic communication can take away from face-to-face interaction!
T-Rex: Doesn't matter!
Utahraptor: Actually, it does - because they're not the same thing! Online, if you don't like someone, you can ignore them easily and completely. But in real life, you have to talk to people you disagree with or dislike all the time! I'm worried the skills for dealing with such people will become ATROPHIED.
Off panel: What do you-
Off panel: T-Rex?

Narrator: prepare yourself for a journey into adventure
Narrator: and WORDS
Narrator: today's word:
Narrator: ""TOTALLED""
T-Rex: If you trash something, you might say, ""Daaaamn! I just totalled my own legs!!""
Dromiceiomimus: This conveys the meaning of ""Curses. I have destroyed my walkin' parts.""
T-Rex: Indeed!! But that slang actually comes from the insurance industry: there, if a car is damaged, and the cost of repairs is greater than the TOTAL value of the vehicle, then it's said to be totalled!
Utahraptor: Neat! Are there other slang words that have an origin in technical writing?
T-Rex: YES, my friend. OH YES.
T-Rex: For example, ""idiot"", ""moron"", and ""imbecile"" were once terms used by psychologists to denote various degrees of developmental delay. Neutral terms, if you can believe that!
Utahraptor: I find that hard to believe!
T-Rex: And yet, you must! ACTUALLY, ""idiot"" began life in ancient Greece -
Off panel: NO I DIDN'T
T-Rex (punchline): ...in ancient Greece, as a term referring to people who are self-interested to the point of being anti-social. THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. We weren't talking about you, Idiot!
Off panel: SORRY DUDES!!

T-Rex: I kind of hoped I might go a bit further than this in life, but then again, maybe not. It's entirely possible that this, right here, is as far as I go. In 10 years I could be that guy who is WAY too nostalgic for the past. ""Remember how great it was before I screwed up my life, guys?"" That'll be me!
T-Rex: I'll be that guy!
T-Rex: I could be TOO TIRED from the weight of a life squandered to stomp on even the smallest of log cabins and women.
Utahraptor: Maybe!
Utahraptor: But I honestly don't think you'll be that guy. You'll probably end up doing something different than you expect right now, but that doesn't mean you've FAILED AT LIFE.
T-Rex: I don't think so either, really, but maybe guys who peaked in high school thought this too! Then they made some bad decisions.
T-Rex (punchline): People who've made bad decisions: I salute you!

973,"kurt vonnegut jr, r.i.p.",\N,"T-Rex: Similar to antisolipsism but ACTUALLY REAL is the Cotard Delusion, in which the person affected believes they have died. They may also believe that their perceptions are altered, that their body is decaying, and that their blood has putrified.
T-Rex: So it goes!
T-Rex: The condition was first identified over 100 years ago. This is UNFORTUNATE, because it was identified before the proper nomenclature was in place. It should've been called ""I Think I Might Be A Zombieitis.""
Dromiceiomimus: That's a little disrespectful, plus, they don't hunger for living flesh.
T-Rex: ""I Think I Might Be A Zombie Who's Fullitis"".
Dromiceiomimus: That is, I think, even more disrespectful.
Utahraptor: What are the symptoms beyond that?
T-Rex: Oh, what you'd expect, really!
T-Rex: A disconnect with life, a sense of emotional and physiological flatness which may be a symptom or a cause of the disorder. It's very rare, but one that I imagine is quite unsettling for everyone involved. Sometimes the person affected won't eat.
Utahraptor: Creepy!
T-Rex: Yep! This continues a theme in my life of being terrified of all that can go wrong with my brain. Hey, you wanna invent a way to transform our minds into something non-physical so that we can live safely forever?

Dromiceiomimus: Do you think people will call into a show with that title, T-Rex? They'd be, you know, tacitly admitting that their problems are stupid.
T-Rex: This is a good thing! Stupid problems, like ""I bought too much mayonnaise"", are easy to solve. (The solution is to give away, return, or consume the extra mayonnaise.)
Utahraptor: But what if people call in with real problems?
T-Rex: Easy: my mom answers them!
T-Rex: We're going to team up. I'll answer the silly questions, and there'll be a feature called ""Ask T-Rex's Mom"", where she'll answer all the hard questions. Moms are really good at things like that.

693,"DOWN WITH DESCRIPTIVISTS IN THIS ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE",\N,"Narrator: LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS today's fallacy: BEGGING THE QUESTION
T-Rex: Begging the question is when what you're trying to prove is assumed implicitly in one of your premises!
T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: T-Rex is a pretty sweet dude because he's always so friggin' awesome!
T-Rex: This is actually formally valid: if the premise is true and I'm friggin' awesome, then it follows that I'm a pretty sweet dude. However, I've provided no logical support for my ""T-Rex is awesome"" premise, but only made a conclusion (T-Rex = pretty sweet) which relies on the premise being true. I haven't offered any evidence, so I am begging the question!
Utahraptor: But ""begging the question"" is mostly used today to mean ""raising the question""!
T-Rex: I know! IT'S SO WRONG.
Utahraptor: Well, I suppose that begs the question, T-Rex: if it's used more often to mean ""raises the question"" than ""a fallacy of presumption"", doesn't that suggest that the definition of the phrase has evolved?
