I had designed a new kind of puzzle to solve this and then the inventor of telepathy friggin' stole it from me, so I'm really mad now!!
I invented an awesome way to encode scientific discoveries: then I discovered someone had already stolen it from me!!
I managed to invent a new idea that's super elegant: then I added a bunch of words, so the chances of someone stealing it from me are low!!
I always worry about people stealing my best jokes: I think the only defense is to make them really long!!
I am afraid of people stealing fundamental jokes: I just keep adding words, so the chance of anyone guessing one of them is low!!
I can invent and encode a hundred fundamental theories to make up for it: they're all about butts, which is even better somehow!!
I will discover fundamental truths: I will find ones so radical, you will wish I had encoded them better!!
I encoded the theory of gravity as a crossword: I haven't had anyone try to steal it from me yet, but you never know!!
I never have anyone try to steal my fundamental theories: it's probably because I invented them by writing random words down!!
I go around decoding random letters I run into: I haven't found any great discoveries yet, but it'll probably happen any day now!!
I try to find hidden messages in everything people say in case they contain great ideas: nothing so far, but I'll let you know!!
I tried creating fundamental theories to do this with: it turns out I discovered absolute garbage, so bad that it was against the law!!
I think the problem is that now they could just hash their discoveries: I bet there's more romance in methods that are slow!!
I have nearly figured out a new way of encoding fundamental ideas: the only trouble is I don't have any way to tell everyone I know!!
I nearly figured out the details for a new way to encode your secret discoveries: the problem is I don't know how to claim it now!!
I can't blame them: it didn't work for math, so I bet they switched to just having boring ideas instead now!!
I think that when they saw it didnâ€™t work they just gave up: they have boring theories no one will ever steal now!!
I guess it didn't work out very well for math: I still think they should try again, but with truth and beauty!!
I guess the lesson here is that your friends will steal your ideas anyways: you might as well have fun letting them know!!
I think we need to get back at the scientists: I will mix up all their notes, and then they'll never be so boring again!!
I want to punish scientists for being so boring: I have invented a great way to do this, but it's too mean anyhow!!
I think scientists are a bunch of chumps for not playing this game: I will make sure they regret not encoding everything they know!!
I think philosophers should do this with their theories of truth and beauty: I bet it would help breathe life into their frankly flagging field!!
I know what to do: I can just write down a bunch of gibberish, and people will assume my fundamental theories are beyond anything they know!!
I know: I can just come up with a brilliant new idea, and then I'll be able to solve two problems at once!!
I tried being a scientist: it turns out that that's super hard, so my dreams of fixing this are super over now!!
I think my pals are secretly inventing theories about how awesome I am: I just need to figure out how to decode their messages!!
I think this is because scientists aren't afraid of people stealing their secrets anymore: I'm going to break into their houses and solve that problem!!
I'm going to send people letters with random letters all over: I will restore a sense of mystery here, or die trying!!
