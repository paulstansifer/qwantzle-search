120,"we suuure do","","Narrator: SCIENCE VS RELIGION round three
T-Rex: Stupid Science.
T-Rex: He thinks he's such hot stuff!
T-Rex: Just because there are different religions with different opinions on things, he dismisses them all?
T-Rex: Couldn't they all be describing the same shared desire for an understanding of what's bigger than ourselves?
T-Rex: You know what Science's problem is?
Utahraptor: Oh yeah? You know what Religion's problem is?
T-Rex and Utahraptor: You think you have the monopoly on truth!
T-Rex (punchline): We sure have some good times, eh?
"
123,"the last act of a desperate man","","T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for sharing secrets!
Narrator: SECRET SHARING COMICS
T-Rex: Hey Dromiceiomimus, want to know a secret?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure!
T-Rex: Alright, but you have to promise not to tell anyone!
Dromiceiomimus: Ok!
T-Rex: Ok, my secret is that I stole the Utahraptor's couch last night! Don't tell him, alright?
Utahraptor: T-Rex, have you seen my couch? It's gone missing!
T-Rex: Oh?
Utahraptor: Yes, and there were T-Rex prints all over my shag carpet.
T-Rex: Well, ah, heh-
T-Rex: You see, the thing is...
T-Rex: um
T-Rex (punchline): Can I let you in on a secret?

Narrator: also featuring: mild anti-vegetarian sentiment
T-Rex: I once read how to make bombs!
Dromiceiomimus: I once read how to hypnotize anyone!
Utahraptor: I once read how to make a really good salad!
T-Rex: That's it? The whole Internet and you look up salads?
Utahraptor: You don't understand! It's a really good salad!
T-Rex: Is it meat salad?
T-Rex (punchline): Because if not then I doubt it would be a very good salad!
"
180,"it is a straight-forward example that can be applied to your own life","","Narrator: A METHOD BY WHICH SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS SERVE TO LIMIT PERSONAL FREEDOM
Narrator: a comic
T-Rex: Today I am hungry! Perhaps I could satisfy this hunger by eating...
T-Rex: ...everyone?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you look delicious today! I would love to have you for dinner tonight!
Dromiceiomimus: W-what, you want to eat me?
T-Rex: I am going to eat everyone!
Utahraptor: You can't threaten to eat your friends!
T-Rex: Says you!
Utahraptor: Well, you CAN, but then they won't be your friends anymore.
T-Rex: Because I will have eaten them!
Utahraptor: No! Because they will eat YOU and cut you up with their pointy toenails!
T-Rex: Perhaps I will not eat my friends after all!
Off panel: Perhaps!
T-Rex (punchline): Perhaps!

206,"happy american thanksgiving!","","T-Rex: Seeing as I missed Thanksgiving last month, I am celebrating a new holiday today, one which I just invented! I call it, ""American Thanksgiving""!
Narrator: AMERICAN THANKSGIVING COMICS
Narrator: (similar, but distinct, from regular Thanksgiving)
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, would you like to come over tonight for a big ""American Thanksgiving"" dinner?
Dromiceiomimus: Sure! I'll bake a delicious pumpkin pie for dessert!
T-Rex: Excellent!
Utahraptor: What's the deal with this ""American Thanksgiving"" holiday you invented, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Well!
T-Rex: It's a time for us to reflect on all the great things we have, such as food and shelter! You spend an evening with friends and family. Want to come over for American Thanksgiving?
Utahraptor: Sounds great! I'll bring some of my famous pumpkin pie!
Utahraptor: You can never have too much pie!
Narrator: CONCLUSION:
T-Rex (punchline): American Thanksgiving is similar, but distinct, from regular Thanksgiving.

258,"and there's this other great one from two weeks ago where the t-rex totally forgets his line and has to ask for it!!","","Narrator: HILARIOUS OUTTAKES COMICS
T-Rex: It's been a memorable two weeks indeed!
T-Rex: Do you recall a few days ago, when we had that hilarious conversation?
Dromiceiomimus: I thought I would die laughing!
T-Rex: I - um.
T-Rex: Line?
Narrator: HILAROUS OUTTAKES COMICS II
T-Rex: So what meaning do you see my actions representing?
Utahraptor: The futility of life?
T-Rex: Oh man!

287,"all we can do now is lick our wounds and OH GEEZ","","T-Rex: There are a lot of problems in the world! Someone ought to do something.
T-Rex: Wait a second!
T-Rex: I'M someone!!
T-Rex: Okay Dromiceiomimus, I'M going to do something about all the problems.
Dromiceiomimus: Great attitude, T-Rex! And I'm sure people already working on problems will appreciate the help. Which problem(s) are you going to focus on?
T-Rex: Uh... all of them?
Utahraptor: Might help to focus on one or two of them.
T-Rex: Of COURSE! Utahraptor - that's IT!
T-Rex: There's BILLIONS of people alive right now, and surely - SURELY - there's not actually BILLIONS of problems. If everyone take one problem each and solve it, then it won't be a lick of work! And then we could have this licked lickety-split!
Off panel: Great, I'll take solving the problem of world hunger!
T-Rex: And I'll take our sudden overuse of lick-based idioms! It doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'm sure I can lick it into shape!

Off panel: Hey there, hot stuff!
T-Rex: Ladies, please! One at a time!
Off panel: Rrrawl!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you've got to help me! I've doused myself in a chemical I discovered that makes me seem irresistible to women! Only I've become TOO irresistible! It's out of control!
Dromiceiomimus: Sure, I'll help you! Why don't we start with my helping you in the ways of... PLEASURE?
T-Rex: Oh no! It's affected her too!
T-Rex: I'm doomed!
Utahraptor: Well, isn't this what you wanted?
T-Rex: Utahraptor!
Girl: ❤
T-Rex: You've got to help me, Utahraptor! I don't know what to do!
Utahraptor: Why? You're living every teenage boy's fantasy!
T-Rex: It's a stupid fantasy! It doesn't even make sense!
T-Rex: I mean, a chemical that makes me seem irresistible to women? What is that, reverse alcohol?
T-Rex (punchline): I like to keep my sexual fantasies grounded in good science, thanks!
"
353,"being able to transform a compliment about a fact you know into a compliment about yourself is another perk","","Narrator: T-REX AS: ""THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST""
T-Rex: Computers store information in binary code, which is a series of 1s and 0s!
T-Rex: In fact, ALL information in a computer - text, video, sound, even PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES - are stored in the same fashion, as 1s and 0s. Here's the interesting part:
T-Rex: Any series of 1s and 0s can be converted (quite easily) into a regular number! So, for instance, your favourite song is contained - quite literally - in one single, 4 million digit number.
Utahraptor: So copyright law is in a state of self-contradiction!
T-Rex: Quite right!
T-Rex: You can't copyright a fact (like a number), but you can copyright a creative work, like a song or piece of software. But since one can be transformed into another, copyright law is logically INCOHERENT.
Utahraptor: That's really cool!
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex (punchline): But, being really cool IS one of the perks of being a computer scientist!

392,"also, hopefully the person doing the dumping can't be bothered to read more than the first 2 panels!","","Narrator: I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP
Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Dear recipient of this comic:
T-Rex: It isn't working out!
T-Rex: Maybe it's not you, it's me! MAYBE there were many small things that added up to this relationship not working.
T-Rex: I don't know. This card isn't very personalized.
T-Rex: Come to think of it, I'd be pretty pissed if someone broke up with me like this!
Utahraptor: Yeah, this is even worse than a break-up email! You have to at least compose an email.
T-Rex: Too true!
T-Rex: I think whoever is being dumped here is better off without this person!
Utahraptor: Me too!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: Dear recipient of this comic: You're better off without this jerk!
T-Rex (punchline): I would still like to hear about the sex, however!

T-Rex: Huh?

God: WELL IN SOME PLACES PEOPLE DON'T REALLY USE REGULAR PHONES
God: I GOT A CELL PHONE YOU KNOW
T-Rex: You do?
God: YEAH IT'S PRETTY GREAT MY RINGTONE IS THE THEME SONG TO TELEFRANCAIS
Utahraptor: Who are you talking to, T-Rex?
T-Rex: God, again!
T-Rex: He was just telling me that I shouldn't make fun of people with cell phones, because He has a cell phone too!
Utahraptor: What does God need with a cell phone?

401,"t-rex defines himself by wanting all the cool things","","Narrator: T-REX IN: ""YOUNG PARENTS""
T-Rex: Young parents!
T-Rex: What's the deal?
T-Rex: How come they want to have kids so quickly? Don't they want to live a hedonistic adult-child lifestyle, like mine, for just a little longer?
T-Rex: I don’t understand! Marriage?
Utahraptor: Did you think maybe they just found the right person?
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: Yeah, maybe they know what they want, and that’s to share their lives, and a beautiful child, with each other!
T-Rex: MAYBE, but how come I don’t want that? I want all the cool things!
T-Rex (punchline): Also: how come my bed is so cold and empty at night?

473,"s-sometimes?","","T-Rex: So what's the deal with SISTERHOOD?
T-Rex: Hah hah!
T-Rex: Am I right?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, T-Rex! Are you upset because as a male, you'll never be able to know the small joys and frustrations of having and being a sister?
T-Rex: No way! I know all about sisterhood! I know all about all sorts of things.
Utahraptor: I don't think you do! I think this is something which almost by definition is unknowable for you.
T-Rex: Well even if it WAS, I could always get a sex change and a new family or something. I don't know! How nuanced can it be to be a member of a set of two mutually female siblings?
Utahraptor: You'll never know!
T-Rex (punchline): Do you ever wonder what the pillow fights are like?

524,"will this help octopus t-shirt sales, or just make people terrified to wear them?  i'm already kind of terrified!","","T-Rex: My sinister raccoon and cephalopod neighbours are having a sleep-over party. Okay! That's innocent enough. I don't judge!
T-Rex: But putting up fliers for it around town?
T-Rex: That's creepy! That's odd! That's OFF. Who indiscriminately invites people to a slumber party?
Dromiceiomimus: Your neighbours, apparently!
T-Rex: Apparently!
Utahraptor: So are you going to go? You are their neighbour, after all!
T-Rex: No way, man!
T-Rex: I've TOLD you all the creepy things they've said to me! I don't want to put myself in a situation where I'm UNCONSCIOUS and pyjama-clad around them! Holy heck!
Utahraptor: I think maybe you should go! How bad could it be? They're your NEIGHBOURS.
Narrator: THAT NIGHT:
Off panel: COME TO OUR SLUMBER PARTY, NEIGHBOUR?
T-Rex: I'm sorry, I - I think I'm busy that night!
Off panel: YOU CAN SLEEP IN MY ROOM, T-REX.
Off panel (punchline): I JUST WANT TO TASTE YOU
"
526,"not too shabby!","","T-Rex: Isn't it CRAZY how young some people are when they get married?
T-Rex: It's CRAZY!
T-Rex: My parents were only twenty when they got married. Twenty! I was nowhere near marriage material at twenty. I was and still am a loose cannon!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe they just found the right person?
T-Rex: Twenty, though! You're almost still a teenager at that age! A baby! How do you know enough to get married?
Utahraptor: I think that marriage is a very personal thing, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, yeah!
Utahraptor: No, really! It's an expression of love, which is almost by definition inexpressible to someone else. Marrying young probably just seems crazy to you because you didn't meet the right person at that age!
T-Rex: So it's essentially unknowable to me unless I had married at that age myself... Hmmm...
Narrator: ANYWAY, T-REX GOES BACK IN TIME TO WHEN HE WAS 20, FINDS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, AND MARRIES HER:
T-Rex: Kick ass!
T-Rex (punchline): So THAT'S what that feels like!
"
533,"hey, the sensual sensation was my nickname in high school!","","T-Rex: I know one thing that puts us (living people made out of meat) above machine intelligences.
T-Rex: That thing is the ability to feel physical pleasure!
T-Rex: For instance, I'd like to see a machine intelligence feel the relief of a cool breeze on a hot summer's night. They can't, because they're machines!
T-Rex: We are the much more sensual people.
Utahraptor: I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here, T-Rex!
T-Rex: People &gt; machines!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but - couldn't a machine intelligence just press some mental button to emulate a cool breeze or any other sensual sensation? And since they don't really exist yet, I'm not sure why you're arguing small points about them?

Narrator: T-REX IN: ""MAN, I'M AMAZING""
T-Rex: I'm a machine that turns chicken wings into things being stomped on. I turn a whole friggin' bag of chips into new ideas about gender relations! What other creation (besides other dinosaurs, OF COURSE) can turn physical things into abstract ideas? I'm totally great!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're forgetting about Babbage engines!
T-Rex: Shoot, I am!
T-Rex: Though they never advanced beyond the prototype stage, his engines were some of the first machines that transformed physical labour (turning a crank) into mental labour (summing two numbers). It was a revolutionary idea!
Utahraptor: Exactly!
T-Rex: And yet - bags of chips! Gender relations!
T-Rex (punchline): I could probably turn all-you-can-eat ribs into a freakin' aria!
"
555,"hah hah!  me too!","","T-Rex: Today is a good day I think to talk about pretension!
T-Rex: Pretension! Ah, pretension!
T-Rex: Where would we be without pretension? We'd be short a few critical essays on Leonard Cohen, that's for sure.
Dromiceiomimus: Hey, what do you have against singer/poetsmith Leonard Cohen?
T-Rex: Nothing! Of course!
Utahraptor: Pretension's pretty subjective, huh?
T-Rex: Alas, it's true!
Utahraptor: One person's pretension can easily be another's well-argued piece of literature.
T-Rex: I'd like to set up some authority for pretension, but that itself would be pretentious.
Utahraptor: That's probably why nobody's done it before.
Narrator: T-REX DOES IT ANYWAY:
T-Rex: Heck, I've got the time!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm UNEMPLOYABLE.

563,"outer space is only 100 km up!  heck, why visit MY PARENTS when it's closer to visit outer space?","","T-Rex: I think I'll go visit some places overseas. Why not? I could plan a trip to the island nation of Australia!
T-Rex: The worst that could happen is ADVENTURES!
Dromiceiomimus: Why Australia, T-Rex? Are you intrigued by its myriad tourist attractions and locations of geographical splendour, including the Outback, coastal reefs, tropical rainforests, crocodile farms, and the beaches?
T-Rex: Not to mention the many stunning parks of natural beauty, populated by unique, rare and tasty animals!
Utahraptor: You know that Australia is really far away, right? Super far?
T-Rex: I know!
Utahraptor: It's just - you're closer to outer space right now than you are to Australia.
T-Rex: Seriously? Wow, I guess you're right, huh? Huh! Well, that really puts my travel plans in perspective.
Banner (punchline): Why visit Australia, when it's closer to visit outer space?
"
597,"ARE THEY PRETTY OKAY","","T-Rex: I'm not hotted out by women who continue to wear high heels while getting increasingly naked.
T-Rex: I'm just not!
T-Rex: I have a Theory about conventional western civilization being infatuated with a cartoonish idea of femininity.
Dromiceiomimus: Explain!
T-Rex: Well, you look at the women shown as being attractive in the media, and what do you see? An exaggerated female stereotype, with all of the womanly characteristics underlined and highlighted.
T-Rex: It's as if guys are so afraid of being called gay, they go for the most capital-w Woman they can find!
Utahraptor: That's absurd!
T-Rex: I don't think so, man! I think it's a side-effect of homophobia in the media.
Utahraptor: There's so much wrong with your theory, I don't know where to start.
T-Rex: Okay! How about with ""womanly characteristics""?
T-Rex: Isn't that an odd and frankly creepy way to describe something? ""I'm really interested in your womanly characteristics, darling.""
T-Rex: ""What are they like""
T-Rex (punchline): ""What are they like""
"
606,"t-rex is using the gender-neutral 'guys' there.  it is a construction not without controversy.","","T-Rex: Anyway, forget infinite time! I have a better idea. What if this universe is just one... of many?
T-Rex: Okay, people have had my awesome idea before. BUT!
T-Rex: BUT, my idea is actually DIFFERENT. Because what if these universes all exist at once, right now, regularly spaced throughout an infinitely-huge multiverse? Instead of infinite time, infinite space. Then, trillions and trillions of kilometres away from me in every direction is another universe, with another me!
T-Rex: Infinite high fives all around!
Utahraptor: I think this idea has been put forward before, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What? Not again!
Utahraptor: Yeah, the idea of multiple universes is so popular, I'm pretty sure EVERY theory that's at least borderline plausible has been put forward before.

671,"utahraptor does see the benefit of talking about it, of course, he just wants to avoid a discussion about meta-ethics with t-rex.  it would be nice to go one week without talking about meta-ethics, is his opinion.","","T-Rex: When someone says ""murder is wrong"", they're clearly making an ethical statement. But what are they actually saying? Let's totally find out!
T-Rex: Okay, so -
T-Rex: ""Murder is wrong!""
T-Rex: Wait - was I just saying that it is objectively and verifiably true that murder is always wrong? That's a pretty big statement. Or was I merely saying that it's the societal consensus of most that murder is not such a good idea? Maybe it's an emotional statement, saying ""I'm against murder, personally"". Or MAYBE it's more of an imperative, better phrased as ""Don't murder!""
Utahraptor: We've built a whole system around ethics, and you're questioning its foundation!
T-Rex: That's right, baby!
T-Rex: I think it's cool that most people will agree that ""murder is wrong"", but that they all might have very different ideas of what that actually means. We never really specify!
Utahraptor: And we never will! What's to be gained from arguing fine semantic points of justifying MURDER?
T-Rex: A better understanding of ethics? Plus the ability to not feel bad for accidentally ""murdering"" your friends who shoot down your ideas.

T-Rex: T-Rex says, ""probably not!""

T-Rex: I think, as a people, we have kind of dropped the ball!
T-Rex: Seriously! I can't think of any revolutionary philosophical discoveries - like one that would make us all friends - that we've come across recently. Man, even DEMOCRACY was invented in Grecian times and we've just fleshed out some of the details since then. How come we haven't made any ultimate discoveries of essential truth?
Utahraptor: We have, T-Rex! We have made all sorts of SCIENTIFIC discoveries.
T-Rex: TRUE.
T-Rex: But the big questions - why are we here, where are we going - these are left OPEN despite lifetimes of work being thrown at them! I expect nothing less than total truth and civilization has given me five thousand years of LETTING ME DOWN.

The first year, at breakfast, the first monk speaks and says ""I hate oatmeal."" A year later, again at breakfast, the second monk speaks and says ""I love oatmeal."" Finally, one year later, the last monk gets to speak and HE says ""I'm tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal!""
T-Rex: Hee hee! Comedy gold!
Utahraptor: Aw, that's an old joke!
T-Rex: BUT A GOOD ONE! It's funny, I think, because the conversation is spread over three years, and NORMALLY, you'd expect monks not to talk about oatmeal for that long.
Utahraptor: I think it's funny because monks are normally thought of as holy, not as oatmeal obsessed OR oatmeal loathing!

T-Rex: Sweet! Okay, so the idea is, there's this guy, Lee, right? Only one day he gains SUPER POWERS. And I'm not sure how he gets them yet but BASICALLY he's got this slot in the top of his head, and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot, and he gains those qualities! So say a decision has to be made: he writes ""decisive"" on a card and forces it into his head, and he becomes Decisive Lee! He then has the power to do things decisively. SUPER decisively!
Utahraptor: So he's got any power that can be described by an English adverb ending in ""ly""?
T-Rex: PRECISELY!
T-Rex: But not just Precise Lee - he can be Compelling Lee, Obliging Lee - even Furious Lee! But the catch is, the cards stick out, so enemies know what they're dealing with. ""Oh cool, we're dealing with Conclusive Lee"", they'll say. ""We can ask him some questions.""

If he's interested in you, he'll pick it up and play with it, but if he's NOT interested, he'll push it back to your side. The salt shaker represents your feelings here, okay? And playing with a salt shaker represents ROMANTIC INTENT.

1199,"if shakespeare was alive today, future historians could just check his blog record and say, ""aha! on april 7th his current music was 'linkin park' and his current mood was 'cheezed'. right on.""","","T-Rex: Shakespeare was a famous writer guy, but we know basically nothing about him! There's only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day.
T-Rex: And at other times, there's no record of him for years and years!
T-Rex: The fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness, and that he got married. Legal records are all we've got! His interests and tastes, politics and loves - they all have to be (unreliably) extrapolated from his writing.
Dromiceiomimus: Well, he IS from the past, and 80% of the plays from his time survive as titles alone! We're lucky to have the data we do.
T-Rex: That's true! I just wish we knew more about the man, you know?
Utahraptor: You're not alone in that!
T-Rex: So let's agree! If one of us ever get a chance to go back in time, and we run into him, then we'll definitely ask Shakespeare what he was up to. What he likes, what his interests are - all the stuff historians wish they had!
Utahraptor: Hah! Okay, it's a deal!

1216,"well, it seems we both have QUESTIONS","","T-Rex: It turns out there actually is a disease where you cry all the time! Dacryorrhea! I made it up but it already exists.
T-Rex: This is not the first time this has happened!
T-Rex: There's TONS of horrible diseases that sound like they're just made up by somebody, but actually do exist. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, in which connective tissue becomes bone, freezing a person in place! The Capgras delusion, in which loved ones appear to you to be replaced by identical impostors! And these are just the two I know about.
T-Rex: And THEN, there's the diseases that are familiar because they're so common, but still messed up!
Utahraptor: Such as?
T-Rex: Man, Alzheimer's? I mean, I know this disease has always been an issue for me, but it's so terrible. And honestly, it sounds like it's something out of bad fiction. It's ridiculous on the same level as ""always cries"". It shouldn't happen.

T-Rex: But guys! I still totally want to be a stand-up comedian!
T-Rex: So I've been doing RESEARCH. I've been going to Comedy Club after Komedy Klub and figuring out how their performers make jokes. It's easy to duplicate the bad comedians, but it's hard to figure out the good ones!
Dromiceiomimus: How so?
T-Rex: Comedy relies on surprise, I think! There's a twist that makes a joke funny, and I haven't figured out a generative algorithm yet.
Utahraptor: Hey, I wanted to try stand-up too!
T-Rex: Then come with me tonight: we'll go to a show!

"
1225,"the premise of the new batman books? um, hello? it's that alfred and spider-man don't get along and we watch the sparks fly??","","T-Rex: The problem with Superman, and Spider-Man, AND Batman, and pretty much every other superhero, is that their stories don't have ends. They're all stuck in the same productive age range, 20-30 years old, and it's easy to see why!
T-Rex: Companies don't want their most popular characters dying of old age!
T-Rex: But the result is that their stories don't have ENDS. We don't know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age, how Spider-Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks. I mean, we DO, because sometimes out-of-continuity stories explore this, but they're never for real - they don't count! Bats is always 30 again in the next story. It's like David fights Goliath, but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years, and you never see how it ends.
Utahraptor: You know, there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: Soaps have long-running narratives, but characters die all the time. The difference is soaps focus on PREMISE rather than individuals, so they're not killing a cash cow when someone dies. They just bring in someone new!
T-Rex: So Batman dies, and the book focuses on his butler Alfred working for Spider-Man instead!
[T-Rex imagines a dialog]
Imaginary Alfred: Sir, I am old and conservative. You can't expect me to ""loosen up"" overnight.
Imaginary Spider-Man: Alfred, I'm young and liberal! I don't like your ""rules""!!
Imaginary T-Rex: Gentlemen, gentlemen!! Please!

Only that would be irritating, so maybe - well, I'm not sure what the solution is.

T-Rex: Pornography for everyone!
T-Rex: Obviously, you can't control how explicit images are, since they're set. But, you CAN control how explicit text is, since any images there are imagined by the reader.

T-Rex: Nice going, Maslow!
T-Rex: At the top is SELF ACTUALIZATION, which sounds pretty great, right? Except you can't get there unless you've already satisfied the level beneath it, which is esteem. And you don't get esteem - both self and from others - without relationships, and you don't worry about friggin' relationships until your basic safety needs are met. And finally, you don't worry about basic safety if you need to poop!

T-Rex: So Hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms; I believe this was a matter of some investment. But build it he did, and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up, with each of them wanting a room! Lucky for Hilbert he had his infinite hotel, so each guest got a room, and the hotel was filled up to capacity. Nice! But just then another friggin' bus showed up, and it ALSO had infinity people in it!
Utahraptor: Nobody builds for TWO infinite buses showing up right after the other!
T-Rex: Turns out they do!
T-Rex: He just told every guest already there to move into the room that was double their current room number. So the guest in room 3 moved into room 6, and so on! Thus, only the even-numbered rooms were occupied, and everyone on the new bus could have an odd-numbered room!

T-Rex: Why simulate an entire universe when you can just simulate one awesome dude?
T-Rex: Let's assume that if we're simulating universes, we're doing it for a reason. Sure, SOME simulations would be the whole universe, but that's complicated and expensive! Why simulate boring microbes galaxies away if we're just interested in one dude on Earth? And why simulate this one dude at all, unless you're trying to find out more about him and his life, get inside his head, perhaps.. FIND OUT WHERE HE BURIED THE DIAMONDS??
Utahraptor: You're proposing simulations be used for historical research!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: And since MY consciousness is the only one I can confirm, it means that outside this simulation, in my REAL life, I did something SO RAD that people are still trying to figure it out. You're here to ensure I act like I did before, and perhaps, at the end, to ask me -

T-Rex: We used to date!
T-Rex: Anyway, Chuggy G says ""Dear Professor Science: why can't we get all our meals in pill form?"". One time Chuggy G and I went to a pond to feed the ducks; she loved doing things like that. When we got there, all the ducks were gone. I don't remember what we did after that.
T-Rex: Isn't that weird? I haven't thought about that day for years.
Utahraptor: We can't eat only pills because they don't contain the calories we need!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: Calories come from fats, proteins carbs and boozes, and none of them compress very well. Plus eating is primal pleasure that I'm sure many would miss. I wonder what Chuggy G is doing right now.
Utahraptor: Plus pills don't recreate texture.
T-Rex: She always said she'd make it big.
Narrator: LATER, AT PROFESSOR SCIENCE'S HOUSE!
T-Rex: Professor Science! Can you introduce me to your friend, Professor Why Am I Suddenly So Nostalgic For Someone I Haven't Thought About In Years??
T-Rex (punchline): It's definitely possible to get a PhD in that, yes?

1907,"in more precise, technical terms: ""does god like poutine"" problem is reducible to the travelling salesman problem, and it goes the other way too.  you heard it here first!","","T-Rex: God, do YOU like poutine?
God: MAN DOES P EQUAL NP
T-Rex: ...Um. Maybe?
T-Rex: It's kinda the greatest unsolved problem in computer science!
T-Rex: If P equals NP then a whole class of problems are easily solvable! But we've been trying to efficiently solve these problems for years, and so far: NO DICE. But if P doesn't equal NP, why haven't we been able to prove it?
T-Rex: So are you saying ""Probably I hate poutine, but it's really hard to prove""? Or - or are you more saying ""If I like poutine, then all public-key crypto is insecure""?
Utahraptor: So who likes poutine?
T-Rex: God! POSSIBLY. And the problem is, um, equivalent to the P=NP problem.
Utahraptor: Ah. So the Clay Mathematics Institute has a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution to the question ""Does God like poutine?""
T-Rex: Yes. As the two problems are equivalent, this is now the world we live in. ""Does God like poutine"" is the most important open question in computer science today.
T-Rex: Doctor Professor Stephen Cook first pondered whether God likes poutine in 1971; his seminal paper on the subject has made him one of the forefathers of computational complexity theory / God poutine.
T-Rex (punchline): ...Actually that's awesome; I'm glad we live in this wicked sweet world!!

1915,"the moon: french?","","T-Rex: In French, each noun is either a boy or a girl, which means you've got a 50% chance of making a mistake that does not impact the ACTUAL meaning of your sentence, but which still makes you wrong. This is how French says ""screw you"" to every student of the language.
T-Rex: That's right! I've finally confirmed what we've all suspected!
T-Rex: And French isn't the only dick here: most Indo-European languages have gendered nouns too. We don't have infinite space in our brains, and speakers of these languages are forced to use up precious neurons remembering whether the moon - THE MOON, ladies and gentlemen - is a boy or a girl. SPOILER ALERT: it's a dude to the Polish and a chick to the French. Woo hoo. Hey, hope you didn't need to remember where you put your keys!
Utahraptor: Did someone just fail a French test?
T-Rex: If you're asking if I failed to care about imaginary moon sex organs, then YES.
T-Rex: Man, why don't we give everything a sexual orientation too while we're at it? From now on, the moon is gay! The Earth is heteroflexible, and the moon: 100% SUPER HOMOSEXUAL.
Utahraptor: So it's a lesbian to the French and a gay dude to the Polish?
T-Rex: YES. THIS IS WHAT WILL MAKE SENSE TO THEM.
T-Rex: Attention, world! This started out as sarcasm but now I'm honestly 100% behind the idea of a gay French moon!

Narrator: GENDERED NOUNS ANTHROPOMORPHIZE.
T-Rex: This one I'm actually in favour of!
Utahraptor: I know, right?
Utahraptor: It's like you never grew up, and somehow everything around you still has this secret little life. Of COURSE my table is a woman! That's what she identifies as whenever I'm not home and all my furniture comes alive.

1977,"this is not the first time t-rex has priced out a skeleton for his house, but it IS the first time he has considered putting it on display there instead of dressing it in construction worker clothes and stuffing it inside the walls","","T-Rex: Buying a skeleton costs thousands of dollars! How are skeletons so expensive? EVERYONE GETS ONE FOR FREE, and it's not like you're going to be using it forever!
T-Rex: Skeletons should be like the most free thing ever!
T-Rex: It occurs to me, Dromiceiomimus, that my skeleton probably looks pretty awesome, and just such a skeleton would look rad hanging up in my living room. Folks would say ""Oh man, that skeleton is awesome!"" and I'd say ""Yes. Like the rhetorical magic, this too was within you all along."" Assuming they were the same species as the skeleton, I mean.
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: Because we're all different species!
Utahraptor: Maybe they're expensive to stop people from treating them casually?
T-Rex: It's way too late for that!
T-Rex: In movies people fight skeletons all the time, and nobody ever says ""Wait, this sword-wielding skeleton used to be inside someone, let's all consider our feelings when I mention that."" Instead they say ""Time to BONE UP on my swordplay!""
Utahraptor: While true, that fails to address the substance of my criticism.
T-Rex: Ooh! Or they say ""SKULLS to meet you!"" Or ""I've got to HAND it to you"" while slapping them with another skeleton's hand! Or ""Aw man! RIBS AGAIN?"" while punching a skeleton in the ribs!!

Utahraptor: And why do we pay him to bring stuff to us in the first place?
T-Rex: Wait. HE'S GETTING PAID? WHY WOULD ANYONE PAY THIS GUY FOR ANYTHING??

T-Rex: I want robot cars!
T-Rex: Driving is a job that's super boring but that nevertheless requires CONSTANT focus and attention, and if you slip up, you DIE. And do you know what we non-robots are pretty sucky at?
Dromiceiomimus: Not dying?
T-Rex: Whoah. I mean, YEAH: I was gonna say we're bad at staying focused on boring stuff, but man, we ARE bad at not dying, huh? We're terrible at it, like, as a RULE. We die all the time. We die in our SLEEP.
T-Rex: How bad do you have to be at sleep to DIE just by trying to do it??
Utahraptor: You were talking about robot cars?
T-Rex: Yeah, finish inventing them and legalize them already. Hey, can you think of a single thing to do that someone hasn't died attempting?
Utahraptor: ...Maybe something super modern like - posting to Twitter? I guess?
T-Rex: Man, someone's TOTALLY died posting to Twitter. I GUARANTEE IT.

Narrator: OKAY: HOW TO MEET WOMEN
T-Rex: Meeting a woman is about getting to know her, and what better way to ""meet"" a woman than to know her very thoughts?? Yes, the easiest way to truly meet women is to pick up a book and learn all about her, including what her motivations and plot points are. What are you waiting for? Millions of single women are waiting to meet you tonight!!
Narrator: HOW TO PICK UP WOMEN
T-Rex: You'll love to ""pick up"" women when you're picking up a book with female characters inside!
Utahraptor: And how!
Narrator: LISTEN I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO START A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ACTUAL WOMAN
T-Rex: Easy! Just patronize businesses. For example, I myself have a nodding relationship with a cashier at the grocery store, and many bus drivers are women.
Utahraptor: A driver patron relationship is a very practical one.
Narrator: PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO GET ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH AN ALIVE PHYSICAL WOMAN
T-Rex: The fact you call her ""an alive physical woman"" says you have tons of unresolved issues; I suggest you work those out first.

Look it up and you'll know how long the Average You will live!
T-Rex: GOOD THING I'M NOT AVERAGE, baby!!
Dromiceiomimus: Pfft. Death's old hat, T-Rex! Birth is where it's at.
T-Rex: MAN, I already know I got born. I even have the date!
Dromiceiomimus: But there's also an average period between fertilization and birth/hatching, and people will readily discuss how much a baby is ""early"" or ""late"" in regards to this average! So do you want to know... THE EXACT DAY YOU WERE CONCEIVED??
T-Rex: Oh my gosh!! I could calculate this, right?
Utahraptor: Trivially!
Utahraptor: But be warned: once you know the exact day your parents boinked you into existence, there's no going back. You'll notice the anniversary every year and you'll wonder if you should be celebrating it. Is a gift for your parents appropriate?

T-Rex: That's right, I said it!
T-Rex: You are a bunch of fake-ass bros, giants!!
T-Rex: But maybe INVISIBLE giants exist? Again, the answer is no: such giant weight would require giant feet, which would leave impressions in the ground visible in satellite imagery. It's kinda why we invented satellites in the first place?
Dromiceiomimus: No it's not.
T-Rex: FINE. It's kinda among the reasons some speculate we had for inventing satellites in the first place?
Utahraptor: Okay, but what about FLYING invisible giants?
T-Rex: Again, these are imaginary.
T-Rex: Any living being requires energy, which means we'd notice them when they fed. And they can't be solar powered, because light's already passing through them! Therefore: fake.
Utahraptor: Huh.

T-Rex: Soon you'll be staring at an obscure compiler error and no magic will be left in the world!
Dromiceiomimus: Are you starting with object-oriented development or structured programming? And either way, how are you introducing declaration scope and abstractions?
T-Rex: I thought I'd actually start with logic gates, and build up to simple machine languages from that?
Dromiceiomimus: Hmm... maybe start with functional programming, so state isn't a concern?
Utahraptor: Computers: more complicated than they seem?
T-Rex: NO, DON'T SAY THAT!
T-Rex: People don't learn about computers because they worry it'll be hard, and if word gets out that they're actually machines so incredibly complex that the last CPU to be designed without other computers helping us was the 386 processor back in 1985, then we're DOOMED.
T-Rex: I'm serious! Don't tell a soul that current processors are so complex that we literally cannot fully understand them, and engineers work in teams where each only understands a little bit at a time!!

Also, she only understands a few limited languages, and getting her to do anything non-trivial can take WEEKS. In fact, whole companies of specialized teams will work for years on trying to get her to do specific tasks! Sounds pretty frustrating, right?
T-Rex: WHAT IF I TOLD YOU SHE EATS ELECTRICITY AND CAN REPLACE HER BODY PARTS AS THEY FAIL??
Utahraptor: Whoah, she sounds kinda awesome!
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: The only downside is she's got a growing army of friends who are all ""inter-networked"" together in an ""inter-net"", so if one finds out a secret the rest NEVER FORGET. Also, her friends spy on you.

T-Rex: Scarred nerve tissue doesn't transmit signals well!
T-Rex: So even if you got a brain transplant without dying, you'd end up being left in a body you couldn't move. This, my friends, is SUBOPTIMAL. Also, the brain is a super sensitive organ and gets damaged really quickly if it doesn't get oxygen. Therefore, brain transplants: super hard. We've never pulled one off here in the mortal world. But what if you had a brain that didn't NEED oxygen? What if you had a body that didn't FORM scar tissue?
Utahraptor: Vampires?
T-Rex: VAMPIRES.

The time: whenever Earth's inhabitants finally invent ships cool enough to take them into space.
T-Rex: ...Or so they thought!
T-Rex: Because when they launched them, the astronauts crashed directly into the firmament!
T-Rex: It was exactly how medieval people supposed: the firmament is a solid mass surrounding the Earth, dotted with windows. Some open to let the sun and moon travel through, while others can be opened to allow gigantic warehouses of water, snow, and hail to discharge their contents. Stars are just lights on the surface.
T-Rex: Needless to say, this was super surprising for the astronauts!
T-Rex: ""Yo, how could we have been so wrong?"" they said. ""We screwed the pooch on this one for sure.""

He met two tailors who promised to make him a suit made of the finest fabric: one visible to ONLY the most intelligent people!
Narrator: THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
T-Rex: The Emperor's ministers couldn't see the suit, but they pretended to so they'd seem smart, and the Emperor did the same. But when he took his new suit out in a parade, little kids shouted ""The Emperor has no clothes!!"".
Dromiceiomimus: Was the Emperor embarrassed?
T-Rex: Why would he be?? His clothing is DESIGNED to be invisible to dumb kids. Nothing about what those kids shouted surprised him!
Utahraptor: So what'd he do after the parade?
T-Rex: He cornered the market on the fabric!
T-Rex: He realized a generally-invisible fabric would have great applications in law enforcement: invisible nets and traps, for example, caught all but the most intelligent criminals. The fabric was also woven into ropes and used to construct beautiful ""floating"" bridges, stairs, and other architecture.
T-Rex: Einsteins and Hawkings could see the wires, but to everyone else it was the most gorgeous, most impossible - and most peaceful - kingdom in the entire world.

Utahraptor: The answer has something to do with quantum physics, right?
T-Rex: Sure! WHY NOT.
T-Rex: Chip, quantum physics allows the collapse of particle superpositions from high-energy nonlocalities, which can result in emergent, time-symmetric, non-deterministic behaviour.

They will look in front of them, they will look around, they will notice things on the ground.
T-Rex: But if you're three stories up, they probably won't see you!
T-Rex: This is a useful fact in a lot of situations. In first-person video games designed to be played by humans, you don't want to put important things above their eyeline, because they won't get seen. In architecture, people might look up your building once or twice, but they'll notice ground-level details all the time, so make them the most attractive and your building's middle section can be just okay.

Utahraptor: And the world flooded and everyone scrambled upon any available boat to survive, while those left behind clawed at the hulls until the water claimed them.
T-Rex: Well, I cried so much MORE that there was so much water that Earth collapsed into a sun, powered by my sorrow!!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND:
T-Rex: In conclusion, Shakespeare, hyperbole is really really really really realLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY just okay!!
Off panel (punchline): PLEASE knock before entering my room

3500,"we will talk about the universal constant stuff AFTER we talk about how much it sucks when your back hurts for no reason","","T-Rex: All right! Who here wants to discuss...
T-Rex: ...THEIR AGING BODIES??
T-Rex: Wooo! Let's all sound off about how our bodies are changing, in every way objectively for the worse, as they get older! Who wants to go first?
Dromiceiomimus: ...
T-Rex: ...
Dromiceiomimus: ...
T-Rex: ...I'll go first!!
T-Rex: My feet hurt when I walk which is strange because THAT'S THEIR ONLY JOB AND THEY SUCK AT IT NOW??
Utahraptor: Hah! Wow!
Utahraptor: As an ageless immortal - better conceptualized as a universal constant slumming it in mortal flesh for a while before I return to my higher plane than as anything that could be compared to your small, limited forms - I can't really relate to this, but it sounds sucky!
Off panel: Also, in this limited form I have temporarily assumed, sometimes my back hurts for no reason.
T-Rex (punchline): Oh my gosh, RIGHT??

3521,"see if you re-read the comic you will find that god is correct!!  is it magic, or is it an animated gif??  I'LL NEVER TELL","","Image description: The image is animated and some of God's lines change after some time; the transcript lists both versions
T-Rex: God, which is the best bird?
God: I DUNNO [before] THEY'RE ALL PRETTY GOOD [after] PROBABLY KORI BUSTARD
T-Rex: But come on, you've definitely got a favourite, right??
God: UH
God: I MADE THEM ALL [before] SO I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE ALL TIED FOR FIRST [after] AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE KORI BUSTARD IS BEST
T-Rex: Come on, tell me the REAL truth. Which one rules the most??
God: T-REX IF I MADE A BIRD THAT WAS BETTER THAN ANOTHER THEN THAT [before] OTHER BIRD WOULD BE LESS PERFECT WHICH IMPLIES I MADE A MISTAKE [after]  FIRST BIRD WOULD BE THE KORI BUSTARD WHICH I LOVE MAKE NO MISTAKE
T-Rex: Just tell me what the best bird is!!
Utahraptor: Kori Bustard.
T-Rex: Is that, uh, its PERSONAL name, or?
Utahraptor: Species. Big ol' birds in Africa. The males puff out their throats to try to look sexy. Just an A+ bird all around, and a personal favourite with ol' Utahraptor.
God: OKAY MINE'S KORI BUSTARD TOO
T-Rex: You can't steal his choice!!
God: NO I JUST WENT BACK IN TIME AND MADE IT SO THIS WAS ALWAYS MY CHOICE
God (punchline): GOD ALWAYS WINS BABY

3539,"if i may be so bold: awataf,a","","T-Rex: When people say ""WTF"" sometimes they add in ""actual"" as an intensifier: what the ACTUAL frig!
Off panel: Only they're not saying ""frig""!!
T-Rex: I KNOW!!
T-Rex: And this, I believe, suggests a productive class as expressions: the Internet Acronym Actual Intensifiers. For example, instead of ""GTFO"", you might say ""get the actual frig out"", or perhaps even ""actually, get the frig out."" I know if someone said that to me I'd say ""holy smokes, that's an intenser version of what I was expecting, well bye!!""
Utahraptor: ""Oh my actual god""?
T-Rex: ""Actually just kidding""!
T-Rex: REST IN ACTUAL PEACE.
Utahraptor: FOR THE ACTUAL WIN.
T-Rex: SHAKING MY ACTUAL HEAD.
Utahraptor: BE ACTUALLY RIGHT BACK.
T-Rex: IN CASE YOU ACTUALLY MISSED IT!!
T-Rex: As you can see there are no flaws with these scheme, so I must insist everyone adopt it immediately. Hit me actually up with these new intense acronyms.
Off panel: This sounds NSFAW.
T-Rex (punchline): Well. TIAL.
