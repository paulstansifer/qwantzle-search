1.03%:  listen.
1.02%:  that was gross
1.01%:  clearly this formula gets worse and
1.01%:  clearly this formula is over.

0.95%:  final
0.94%:  this was clearly
0.94%:  my last one is for
0.94%:  that wasn
0.94%:  I guess this formula is only
0.94%:  that is
0.93%:  I confess

0.45%:  so my formula sounds
0.45%:  my formula is now
0.45%:  so there
0.45%:  hold
0.45%:  I guess this formula was
0.45%:  clearly nurses should start
0.45%:  that sounds awful. I
0.45%:  this formula does
0.44%:  clearly this formula grows
0.44%:  my last advice is for the nurses
0.44%:  I have to say
0.44%:  my last one is for lovers!
0.44%:  my last advice is for women
0.44%:  that one is clearly worse.

0.65%:  I never said my formula was gr
0.49%:  I never said my formula is
0.43%:  I never said my form
0.43%:  so nurses are
0.43%:  this formula is way
0.43%:  my formula sounds less
0.43%:  I guess this could
0.42%:  so I guess my advice isn
0.42%:  this formula is really great.
0.42%:  clearly this formula is an
0.42%:  clearly this needs
0.42%:  not
0.63%:  not really
0.67%:  not really sure
0.46%:  not all
0.68%:  not all advice
0.42%:  screw

0.42%:  I deserve
0.42%:  my advice formula is great!
0.42%:  clearly the formula is strong
0.42%:  finally!
0.41%:  my last formula is this
0.41%:  you can tell
0.41%:  this sounds
0.41%:  I confess!
0.41%:  my last advice for the
0.41%:  clearly whatever
0.41%:  whatever man.
0.41%:  clearly nurses should give
0.41%:  clearly the formula is over
0.41%:  clearly this formula gets more
0.41%:  I totally
0.41%:  clearly this formula is even
0.41%:  so clearly this formula is awesome!
0.41%:  clearly this formula grows tired
0.41%:  my last advice is for nurses.
0.41%:  this formula is way more
0.52%:  this formula is way more vers
0.41%:  so this formula clearly doesn
0.41%:  that one was really gross. I
0.41%:  this formula IS
0.41%:  this advice formula was
0.41%:  well! I guess
0.41%:  this formula is clearly great
0.41%:  this formula is really not
0.41%:  turns out I have
0.41%:  clearly nurses have it worst
0.41%:  I guess this formula covers all
0.41%:  my last advice for nurses was more
0.41%:  my advice formula will
0.41%:  this isn
0.40%:  what if
0.50%:  what if nurses
0.40%:  this was a
0.42%:  this was a really
0.40%:  I guess my formula wasn
0.40%:  I guess this advice
4.31%:  I guess this advice formula
2.25%:  I guess this advice formula isn
2.19%:  I guess this advice formula only
1.90%:  I guess this advice formula really
1.42%:  I guess this advice formula is
0.64%:  I guess this advice formula is really
0.63%:  I guess this advice formula really isn
0.54%:  I guess this advice formula will
0.42%:  I guess this advice formula is only
0.41%:  I guess this advice formula is really not
0.41%:  I guess this advice formula really is
0.40%:  this formula was never
0.40%:  clearly nurses do
0.40%:  so my advice formula is great
0.40%:  so clearly the formula runs
0.40%:  that one is really gross!
0.40%:  so clearly this formula never
0.40%:  clearly this formula is great! I
0.40%:  this formula will never get
0.40%:  my formula still sounds
0.39%:  this is my last advice for now
0.39%:  my last advice formula is when
0.39%:  well! I guess that
0.53%:  well! I guess that covers
0.39%:  I have clearly run out of ideas!
0.39%:  the last one was really gross
0.39%:  this formula really IS
0.39%:  my formula has issues
0.39%:  this formula is great.
0.39%:  clearly this formula is danger
0.39%:  that one clearly
0.39%:  so clearly this last
0.39%:  my advice has
0.38%:  clearly this formula sounds worse
0.38%:  I can see this
0.56%:  I can see this formula
0.38%:  my last word on this is
0.38%:  that one was a
0.38%:  so clearly I should start
0.38%:  my friends. I have
0.38%:  it sounds awful
0.38%:  sounds
0.38%:  clearly I was
0.38%:  clearly this formula is most
0.38%:  I guess my formula still
0.38%:  how
0.38%:  so clearly nurses would
0.54%:  so clearly nurses would rather
0.38%:  clearly this formula gives me
0.38%:  this clearly isn
0.38%:  clearly there
0.38%:  if
0.38%:  clearly nurses should get
0.38%:  clearly I have more
0.38%:  so clearly this formula is meant
0.38%:  my last advice formula is this one.
0.38%:  my last advice for nurses will
0.38%:  you got
0.37%:  screw this
0.37%:  so I guess my formula still
0.37%:  so my last formula is
0.37%:  this formula is clearly more
0.37%:  clearly I should start using
0.37%:  the formula really
0.37%:  this formula is really coming
0.37%:  my advice formula is still great
0.37%:  clearly this formula turns
0.37%:  so I guess my advice for
0.37%:  so clearly I have some
0.37%:  forget nurses. I
0.37%:  my last class
0.37%:  this advice formula is really strong
0.37%:  not all advice is useful
0.37%:  my last answer is
0.37%:  M
0.37%:  my last advice is to
0.37%:  this formula is clearly a
0.37%:  my last advice formula is this.
0.37%:  my last one was
0.37%:  clearly this is an
0.36%:  clearly this formula is T
0.36%:  who cares
0.36%:  this formula only gives
0.36%:  this formula is mostly
0.36%:  this formula only gets
0.36%:  I guess my advice isn
0.36%:  clearly that one was
0.36%:  clearly the formula is not
0.36%:  this formula is losing
0.36%:  clearly I should not
0.36%:  my advice formula is useless!
0.36%:  sure
0.36%:  that was more
0.36%:  clearly that one is
0.36%:  this was a really fun
0.36%:  so this formula can
0.36%:  clearly this formula is moving
1.37%:  clearly this formula is moving towards
0.36%:  so my last formula wasn
0.36%:  clearly this formula is as
0.36%:  clearly this formula is over now!
0.36%:  that sounds more
0.36%:  so I guess my formula covers
0.39%:  so I guess my formula covers all
0.36%:  you win! I have
0.35%:  so I guess my advice formula wasn
0.35%:  clearly this formula is ST
0.35%:  so I might
0.35%:  I have clearly lost
0.35%:  your turn.
0.35%:  clearly this formula means
0.35%:  whoever you
0.35%:  it was
0.35%:  I really should start coming
0.35%:  that sounds gross
0.35%:  I guess this formula won
0.35%:  not really sure how
0.35%:  my last advice is for writers.
0.35%:  enough!
0.35%:  my advice formula is showing
0.35%:  I guess my formula is sort
0.35%:  so my advice formula is sort
0.34%:  I guess my formula was
0.34%:  my last advice is for nurses who get
0.34%:  whatever guys
0.34%:  I love
1.27%:  I love nurses
0.35%:  I love nurses!
0.35%:  I love nurses.
0.34%:  this formula seems
0.34%:  well.
0.34%:  my last advice formula is not
0.34%:  clearly we should start our
0.34%:  um.
0.34%:  clearly nurses have it good
0.34%:  so this last
0.34%:  I still haven
0.34%:  so my formula needs
0.34%:  whatever. I still
0.34%:  new
0.92%:  new formula
0.42%:  new formula!
0.34%:  so whatever
0.34%:  clearly this formula goes
0.34%:  my formula sounds less clever
0.34%:  clearly I have issues
0.34%:  my last advice formula is worth
0.34%:  this formula sounds really racist
0.34%:  my formula does
0.34%:  you can have
0.33%:  that was really gross! I
0.33%:  good
0.33%:  can
0.33%:  my advice for
6.46%:  my advice for nurses was
1.25%:  my advice for nurses might
1.02%:  my advice for nurses has
0.95%:  my advice for nurses is that
0.71%:  my advice for nurses was a
2.86%:  my advice for nurses was a little rough

0.37%:  my advice for nurses was a little mor
0.34%:  my advice for nurses was more
0.34%:  my advice for nurses was sort
0.33%:  so clearly this formula gives us
0.33%:  so clearly this formula IS
0.33%:  listen. I have
0.33%:  this may
0.33%:  that sounds worse
0.33%:  I guess my advice formula is a
0.33%:  I should really write
0.33%:  so clearly I should give
0.33%:  so this formula could
0.33%:  this last one was really forced
0.33%:  I guess this formula is more
0.33%:  this was my
0.33%:  my last dollar
0.33%:  not every
0.92%:  not every formula
0.43%:  not every formula will
0.33%:  the last one is really
0.33%:  this formula is only
0.33%:  my formula sounds worse
0.33%:  so my formula was
0.33%:  I never said my formula was the
0.33%:  I guess my formula still needs
0.33%:  my friends are
0.32%:  whatever. I guess
0.32%:  so clearly this formula is DE
0.32%:  clearly I should write a
0.32%:  clearly this one
0.32%:  clearly this formula is done
0.32%:  this formula only last
0.32%:  the nurses
0.32%:  so my formula could
0.32%:  that one really is
0.32%:  that one could
0.32%:  the formula runs dry at
0.32%:  clearly this was never
0.32%:  so this advice
2.63%:  so this advice formula
0.83%:  so this advice formula isn
0.57%:  so this advice formula only
0.35%:  so this advice formula is really
0.34%:  so this advice formula really
0.32%:  I guess this formula wasn
0.32%:  I guess my last
0.74%:  I guess my last advice
7.15%:  I guess my last advice formula
1.29%:  I guess my last advice formula isn
0.60%:  I guess my last formula
0.62%:  I guess my last formula was

0.37%:  I guess my last formula is
0.32%:  the formula only covers
0.32%:  this formula runs dry at
0.32%:  now clearly
0.32%:  it sounds worse
0.32%:  this formula is really good.
0.32%:  that one was gross
0.32%:  this formula only gets worse
0.32%:  the formula clearly doesn
0.32%:  I lied.
0.32%:  I guess we
0.50%:  I guess we should
0.32%:  clearly this formula was DES
0.32%:  my last advice is for all the
0.43%:  my last advice is for all the nurses
0.32%:  my advice formula is useless.
0.32%:  this is clearly over!
0.32%:  this formula is over
0.32%:  so my advice formula is wrong
0.31%:  clearly this formula is strong.
0.31%:  clearly nurses have a
0.36%:  clearly nurses have a lot
0.31%:  the formula clearly runs
0.31%:  even
0.31%:  my new
1.45%:  my new formula
0.82%:  my new formula is called
0.31%:  this is clearly never
0.31%:  whatever. My
1.30%:  whatever. My formula
0.78%:  whatever. My formula is still
0.65%:  whatever. My formula still
0.47%:  whatever. My formula is great
0.31%:  clearly this formula gives us some
0.31%:  for
0.58%:  for real this
0.53%:  for nurses
0.31%:  so my formula covers
0.31%:  my new advice
5.01%:  my new advice formula
0.91%:  my new advice formula has
0.77%:  my new advice formula still
0.62%:  my new advice formula still has
0.58%:  my new advice formula is less
0.45%:  my new advice formula is still
0.32%:  my new advice formula is great
0.31%:  so clearly the nurses
0.31%:  this formula really isn
0.31%:  so clearly this formula is not as
0.31%:  from
0.31%:  clearly this formula is so strong
0.31%:  that one is clearly flaw
0.31%:  this formula gets old
0.31%:  yeah I
0.31%:  screw nurses.
0.31%:  so clearly this formula is most
0.31%:  that was really gross. I don
0.31%:  so the
2.84%:  so the formula
1.19%:  so the formula is
1.32%:  so the formula is clearly
0.90%:  so the formula isn
0.74%:  so the formula is really
0.54%:  so the formula clearly
0.47%:  so the formula doesn
0.34%:  so the formula only
0.32%:  so the formula really
0.31%:  it doesn
0.31%:  forget I
0.41%:  forget I said nurses
0.40%:  forget I said nurses!
0.31%:  my last advice formula is to
0.31%:  the formula is clearly not
0.31%:  I guess my formula is a
0.30%:  w
0.30%:  my advice formula turns
0.30%:  clearly I have no
0.30%:  clearly this formula is ins
0.30%:  turns out my advice form
0.30%:  my last advice follows this
0.30%:  those nurses
0.30%:  I must
0.47%:  I must confess
0.30%:  I really want
0.30%:  I guess my advice formula is not
0.30%:  my last advice is from
0.30%:  so my advice formula is less than
0.30%:  so listen
0.30%:  clearly this formula runs its
0.30%:  I have some
0.30%:  clearly this formula is genius. I
0.30%:  so clearly this formula is wrong
0.30%:  my form
0.30%:  I love this
2.66%:  I love this formula.
2.24%:  I love this formula!
0.89%:  I love this formula and
0.40%:  I love this formula so
0.30%:  so my formula covers nurses
0.30%:  my advice formula is now useless
0.30%:  this formula is really strong
0.30%:  I guess this isn
0.30%:  guess
0.30%:  my formula is over.
0.30%:  that one was clearly less
0.30%:  I should really start coming
0.30%:  so clearly this formula is great. I
0.30%:  so nurses should really
0.30%:  my formula is a
0.30%:  so much
2.75%:  so much for nurses
1.66%:  so much for nurses.
0.50%:  so much for my
0.30%:  never call

0.29%:  my head
0.29%:  my last advice formula goes
0.29%:  real
0.29%:  my advice formula is still great!
0.29%:  so I guess that
0.29%:  my last advice is for writers!
0.29%:  I never said my formula was E
0.29%:  I guess my last advice is for
0.29%:  so I have
0.29%:  clearly this formula is in
0.29%:  this formula clearly does
0.29%:  I got
0.43%:  I got this
0.33%:  I got this!
0.29%:  forget this!
0.29%:  my formula is useless
0.29%:  they can
0.29%:  clearly this means
0.29%:  this formula only goes
0.29%:  the formula is still
0.29%:  this is my last advice for now!
0.29%:  clearly this was not
0.29%:  you win! I give
0.29%:  I admit it.
0.29%:  I still have some
0.29%:  this is clearly over now
0.29%:  well. I guess
0.29%:  whoever is
0.29%:  my advice for nurses was a little grim
0.28%:  I guess nurses really
0.28%:  so clearly this formula turns
0.28%:  clearly the nurses formula
0.28%:  whatever! I still
0.28%:  I should really go
0.28%:  so clearly nurses have to
0.28%:  so clearly this formula is genius
0.28%:  my advice formula wasn
0.28%:  you win. I have
0.28%:  this formula can really
0.28%:  we should really
0.28%:  this formula is so
0.28%:  nurses.
0.28%:  I have clearly won
0.28%:  so my advice formula is a little rough
0.28%:  I really should go
0.28%:  my advice formula is sort
0.28%:  so my formula is a
0.28%:  T
0.28%:  that one is really awful!
0.28%:  so nurses are clearly
0.28%:  whatever! My
1.45%:  whatever! My formula
0.86%:  whatever! My formula is still
0.71%:  whatever! My formula still
0.56%:  whatever! My formula is great
0.28%:  my advice formula is a
0.28%:  this is all I can
0.28%:  so clearly nurses should go
0.28%:  sorry nurses
0.28%:  my final words to
0.28%:  nurses are hard.
0.28%:  I never said this formula is
0.28%:  so that was
0.28%:  I finally
0.27%:  I have clearly master
0.27%:  this formula is less
0.27%:  clearly the formula was
0.27%:  you win. I give
0.27%:  that really was
0.27%:  I never claimed
0.29%:  I never claimed this
2.02%:  I never claimed this formula
0.27%:  I guess you can
0.27%:  that advice
0.33%:  that advice formula
0.27%:  this was my last advice
0.27%:  this formula is great! I
0.27%:  my formula is great.
0.27%:  my formula is still great!
0.27%:  clearly this formula is IMP
0.27%:  this is clearly an
0.27%:  whoever says
0.37%:  whoever says nurses
0.27%:  the formula was
0.27%:  that doesn
0.27%:  so my advice for
2.71%:  so my advice for nurses was
1.78%:  so my advice for nurses might
1.68%:  so my advice for nurses is that
0.61%:  so my advice for nurses is to
0.29%:  so my advice for nurses has
0.27%:  I guess my formula will
0.27%:  clearly this formula is serving
0.27%:  sorry for
0.27%:  this is fun
0.27%:  I guess this is over
0.27%:  my last word is
0.27%:  this formula IS really
0.27%:  so the formula can
0.27%:  this is my last advice!
0.27%:  my last class is over
0.27%:  this is clearly over.
0.27%:  clearly this formula is D
0.27%:  I guess my last formula wasn
0.27%:  so clearly this formula is now
0.27%:  my formula could
0.27%:  well I guess this
0.58%:  well I guess this formula
0.41%:  well I guess this formula doesn
0.27%:  that one was really cr
0.26%:  so I clearly
0.26%:  this formula was never really
0.26%:  clearly this formula grows tires
0.26%:  I should really focus
0.26%:  this formula really does cover
0.26%:  the formula clearly isn
0.26%:  not all advice is great
0.26%:  so my last advice is
0.26%:  clearly this formula gets weird
0.26%:  whatever! My formula is great.
0.26%:  my formula is showing
0.26%:  now this formula is really
0.26%:  I admit this
0.26%:  I guess this is all
0.26%:  you got me.
0.26%:  so this formula is clearly not
0.26%:  so my formula wasn
0.26%:  that one was gross!
0.26%:  this formula clearly is
0.26%:  I would
0.26%:  so my formula does
0.26%:  I have clearly run out of words!
0.26%:  this advice formula IS
0.26%:  I ran
1.05%:  I ran out of ver
0.26%:  this is really fun.
0.26%:  clearly this formula is not vers
0.26%:  so they
0.26%:  that was gross. I
0.26%:  mostly
0.26%:  the formula can
0.26%:  their
0.26%:  so you
0.26%:  clearly this formula is good!
0.26%:  I guess you can tell
0.25%:  yes!
0.25%:  I guess this formula is really not
0.25%:  I guess my last advice was
0.25%:  I really should focus
0.25%:  this formula is really vers
0.25%:  last call
0.27%:  last call for random
0.25%:  clearly this formula is good.
0.25%:  not really sure what I
0.25%:  clearly I have lost
0.25%:  I ran out of words
0.25%:  I never claimed this formula was gr
0.25%:  you have
0.25%:  this was really fun! I
0.25%:  I get
0.25%:  my advice form
0.25%:  well I guess this formula is
0.25%:  man
0.25%:  it sounds really
0.38%:  it sounds really awful
0.25%:  that one really was
0.25%:  clearly I have master
0.25%:  clearly the last one is
0.25%:  this was fun!
0.25%:  my last advice is for all women!
0.25%:  so this advice formula turns
0.25%:  this will
0.25%:  I give myself
0.25%:  my last advice session
0.25%:  my formula has a
0.25%:  come
0.25%:  clearly the nurses formula was
0.25%:  the formula still
0.25%:  that clearly
0.25%:  that one is clearly worse!
0.25%:  clearly it doesn
0.25%:  I really don
0.25%:  so my formula is not
0.25%:  my formula is great!
0.25%:  I guess nurses will
0.51%:  I guess nurses will have
0.25%:  this formula is clearly great.
0.25%:  yeah!
0.25%:  whatever! My formula is still good
0.25%:  this formula is great and
0.25%:  so my formula is great
0.25%:  that one is gross
0.25%:  so this formula clearly isn
0.25%:  I guess this formula can really
0.25%:  clearly this wasn
0.25%:  my formula is done
0.25%:  I guess this advice formula still
0.25%:  wait.
0.24%:  so clearly this formula is strong
0.24%:  so um
0.24%:  frig.
0.24%:  so my last advice is for
0.24%:  clearly this formula is awesome! I
0.24%:  so I guess my last
0.49%:  so I guess my last advice
4.10%:  so I guess my last advice formula
0.35%:  so I guess my last formula
0.25%:  so I guess my last advice will
0.24%:  my last advice!
0.24%:  my friends have all
0.24%:  my formula is less
0.24%:  so I still
0.57%:  so I still have
0.41%:  so I still have some
0.29%:  so I still haven
0.24%:  my new advice formula is great!
0.24%:  my advice for nurses was a little rough. I
0.24%:  clearly I should go
0.24%:  well. I guess that
0.24%:  clearly I should write some
0.24%:  I feel
0.24%:  last try
0.24%:  this formula is never
0.24%:  this formula is not really
0.24%:  nurses! I
0.24%:  clearly this is now
0.24%:  my last advice is for nurses!
0.24%:  so my formula covers all
0.24%:  so this is
0.60%:  so this is clearly
0.24%:  this formula really is great
0.31%:  this formula really is great!
0.24%:  this formula needs more
0.24%:  this one was
0.24%:  I guess my last advice formula won
0.24%:  I guess this formula really was
0.24%:  so I guess this advice
1.95%:  so I guess this advice formula
1.65%:  so I guess this advice formula really
1.63%:  so I guess this advice formula only
0.41%:  so I guess this advice formula will
0.24%:  so I guess it
0.24%:  so this was
0.24%:  so my formula still has its
0.24%:  my last advice formula is this one!
0.24%:  with
0.30%:  with nurses
0.24%:  clearly this formula gets worse as I
0.24%:  this clearly needs
0.24%:  this formula is very
0.24%:  that really doesn
0.24%:  well. I guess that covers
0.24%:  whatever man! I
0.24%:  so my formula leaves
0.24%:  I will never use
0.51%:  I will never use this
0.54%:  I will never use this formula to
0.43%:  I will never use that formula
0.24%:  clearly this formula is so awesome
0.24%:  I gotta
0.24%:  not all my
1.67%:  not all my advice is great
1.31%:  not all my advice is great.
1.25%:  not all my advice is great!
0.52%:  not all my advice is useful
0.37%:  not all my advice is useful.
0.35%:  not all my advice formula
0.24%:  so I guess my formula covers all the
0.23%:  I am clearly
0.23%:  forget it.
0.23%:  that one was my
0.23%:  clearly nurses are hard
0.23%:  this formula clearly gets
0.23%:  that one is less clear
0.23%:  I guess this formula only covers a
1.19%:  I guess this formula only covers a limited
0.23%:  my friend has
0.23%:  that sounds scary
0.23%:  when
0.23%:  fine. I
0.23%:  clearly I have a
0.23%:  so clearly some
0.23%:  my last advice formula is this!
0.23%:  so clearly this formula was not
0.23%:  my advice formula IS
0.23%:  my advice formula is still great.
0.23%:  so this formula still
0.23%:  I never said this formula was log
0.23%:  my advice formula is now useless!
0.23%:  I haven
0.23%:  clearly this game
0.53%:  clearly this game is over
0.53%:  clearly this game is over!
0.23%:  clearly I have run
0.56%:  clearly I have run out of words
0.24%:  clearly I have run out of ideas
0.23%:  clearly this formula is at
0.23%:  that was really good
0.23%:  my formula still stands
0.23%:  this formula gets really
0.23%:  my last one for
0.23%:  so the formula still
0.23%:  this advice formula is now
0.23%:  I should write
0.23%:  I have clearly run out of steam!
0.23%:  I love this formula now
0.23%:  clearly we should start using
0.23%:  this advice formula will
0.23%:  this formula is clearly more vers
0.23%:  it gets
0.27%:  it gets harder
0.32%:  it gets harder from
0.23%:  this is clearly more
0.45%:  this is clearly more fun
0.23%:  so this formula really doesn
0.23%:  I guess this will
0.23%:  mostly nurses
0.23%:  this is my last formula!
0.23%:  my formula is over now
0.23%:  self
0.22%:  clearly nurses have to
0.22%:  my formula is still great.
0.22%:  this last advice
0.22%:  this advice formula still
0.22%:  I have more
0.22%:  this formula is way less
0.31%:  this formula is way less clever
0.22%:  now I really should
0.22%:  I confess.
0.22%:  I guess that wasn
0.22%:  that one really is awful
0.22%:  my friend! I have
0.22%:  my advice formula gets
0.24%:  my advice formula gets less
0.22%:  so it sounds
0.22%:  whatever. My formula is great!
0.22%:  I guess this advice formula is more
0.22%:  not all advice is great!
0.22%:  the formula is over
0.22%:  time
0.53%:  time for
0.24%:  time for lunch
0.22%:  so clearly the nurses formula
0.22%:  this was never
0.22%:  so clearly the last
0.22%:  I guess this formula leaves
0.22%:  my advice for nurses is to
0.22%:  I guess my advice formula is still not
0.22%:  my last formula doesn
0.22%:  I really wish
0.22%:  this formula is clearly not as
0.22%:  my advice formula has lost its l
0.22%:  I guess my advice formula still isn
0.22%:  I guess my formula can still
0.22%:  my last advice is for women!
0.22%:  still
0.22%:  this formula is clearly genius
0.22%:  I guess this advice formula is not
0.69%:  I guess this advice formula is not really
0.22%:  so my formula IS
0.22%:  we should really start
0.22%:  so clearly I was
0.22%:  my final advice is to
0.22%:  my final word is
0.22%:  my last name
0.22%:  I guess we could
0.22%:  my formula IS
0.22%:  I will confess
0.22%:  whatever! I guess
0.22%:  this is my last one
0.22%:  I guess my formula has a
0.22%:  so I guess you
0.22%:  this last advice formula
0.22%:  clearly this is over now!
0.22%:  I will grant
0.22%:  my formula has run
0.22%:  guys
0.22%:  that really wasn
0.22%:  so clearly we
0.21%:  clearly this formula is S
0.21%:  so clearly the formula gets
0.21%:  clearly this formula is so great I
0.21%:  clearly nurses have got
0.21%:  trying
0.21%:  my advice formula is now useless.
0.21%:  this formula clearly needs a
0.21%:  my advice formula is so
0.21%:  whatever. My formula is still good
0.21%:  no more advice
0.21%:  I guess you win.
0.21%:  all right!
0.21%:  this formula is clearly great!
0.21%:  my last advice isn
0.21%:  it might
0.21%:  clearly this formula is on
0.21%:  clearly this formula does not give
0.27%:  clearly this formula does not give us
0.21%:  all this
0.27%:  all this advice
0.21%:  forget nurses! I
0.21%:  my last advice for writers
0.21%:  my last advice follows the same
0.21%:  this advice formula runs
0.21%:  my last advice formula is sort
0.21%:  this formula is coming
0.21%:  my advice formula has issues
0.21%:  I will never use this formula as
0.21%:  I guess my advice formula won
0.21%:  my last advice for now
0.21%:  so my formula still doesn
0.21%:  my last one!
0.21%:  my formula has now
0.21%:  that one was scary
0.21%:  I guess my formula will have
0.21%:  this is clearly a losing
0.21%:  clearly this formula is wrong.
0.21%:  my last advice formula turns
0.21%:  sorry for the
0.38%:  sorry for the last
0.21%:  my new formula is this
0.21%:  where
0.21%:  I may
0.32%:  I may have lost
0.29%:  I may have run
0.25%:  I may have lost focus
0.25%:  I may have run out of words
0.21%:  that was really mor
0.21%:  so clearly I was right
0.21%:  clearly this formula grows st
0.21%:  this formula is truly
0.21%:  I will never say
0.21%:  my advice formula has gotten
0.21%:  this formula is clearly awesome. I
0.21%:  I guess this formula is over
0.21%:  it sounds gross
0.21%:  so I clearly have
0.21%:  my last advice was less
0.21%:  clearly this formula got
0.21%:  clearly I have run out of words.
0.21%:  my last word on this.
0.21%:  now clearly this
1.33%:  now clearly this formula
0.21%:  this advice formula is really strong!
0.21%:  clearly this formula is unt
0.21%:  my new advice formula rules
0.21%:  clearly this formula is out
0.21%:  well I guess this formula isn
0.21%:  so nurses might
0.21%:  I must have
0.51%:  I must have missed
0.20%:  my last one is called
0.20%:  clearly this formula is done.
0.20%:  not sure
0.24%:  not sure what
0.20%:  I admit this formula
0.20%:  my last advice is for those
0.20%:  my last form
0.20%:  clearly this formula ends
0.20%:  my advice formula is the
0.40%:  my advice formula is the worst
0.20%:  the last one was really gross!
0.20%:  for nurses that
0.20%:  this formula is a
0.20%:  clearly this formula is over and
0.20%:  clearly this formula is great. I don
0.20%:  clearly I never
0.21%:  clearly I never should
0.20%:  that one was silly
0.20%:  I never said my formula was 
0.20%:  so clearly the formula is vers
0.20%:  clearly the formula is wrong
0.20%:  so much for my new
0.20%:  doctors
0.20%:  so I guess my advice formula was
0.20%:  I guess this is over.
0.20%:  clearly I should get
0.20%:  clearly whoever
0.20%:  my last advice rule
0.21%:  my last advice rule is for
0.20%:  I guess my formula leaves
0.20%:  nurse
0.20%:  the formula really is
0.20%:  the formula gets
0.20%:  so my last advice wasn
0.20%:  clearly this formula is P
0.20%:  that really is
0.20%:  this formula is clearly over!
0.20%:  I swear
0.20%:  so clearly I am
0.20%:  so this formula will
0.20%:  so this formula will never
0.20%:  I will say
0.20%:  those were
0.20%:  clearly the formula gets
0.20%:  so clearly this formula is genius!
0.20%:  frig that
0.20%:  not all my advice was
0.20%:  my formula wasn
0.20%:  so I haven
0.20%:  clearly this formula is strong!
0.20%:  clearly this formula gets worse as I run
0.20%:  they all
0.20%:  they all sound
0.20%:  so clearly this formula is great! I
0.20%:  so clearly this formula gets more
0.20%:  this is great
0.20%:  that was really good!
0.20%:  that one was really good
0.20%:  not all advice is useful.
0.20%:  this formula is now clearly
0.20%:  I guess this formula was really
0.20%:  that one was more
0.20%:  that sounds way
0.23%:  that sounds way less
0.20%:  whatever you
0.20%:  so this formula may
0.20%:  nurses are really
0.23%:  nurses are really hard
0.20%:  my last formula sounds
0.20%:  this is my last one!
0.20%:  this last one was really forced!
0.20%:  I never said my formula was right
0.20%:  this was really fun. I
0.20%:  that isn
0.20%:  nurses are totally
0.20%:  nurses are totally screw
0.20%:  I will say this
0.20%:  my last formula is the
0.20%:  I still have a
0.26%:  I still have a long
0.20%:  that sounds really mor
0.19%:  my formula was never
0.19%:  my formula is great and
0.19%:  we can
0.19%:  never call me for
0.19%:  my formula gets
0.19%:  my advice for nurses is a
0.35%:  my advice for nurses is a little rough
0.23%:  my advice for nurses is a little rough.
0.19%:  clearly this formula sounds awesome
0.19%:  whatever! My formula is genius
0.19%:  S
0.19%:  this formula sounds worse
0.27%:  this formula sounds worse every
0.19%:  this formula gets old real
0.19%:  I will grant you this
0.19%:  clearly this formula is over! I
0.19%:  so clearly this formula grows
0.19%:  I could go
0.19%:  my last advice is for regular
0.19%:  I guess this means
0.19%:  this sounds really
0.36%:  this sounds really awful
0.19%:  so my advice for nurses IS
0.19%:  my last one will
0.19%:  my last advice is for all women.
0.19%:  turns out my advice is all
0.19%:  that could
0.19%:  this sounds awful
0.19%:  this formula really can
0.19%:  clearly the formula is missing
0.19%:  my advice isn
0.19%:  all right.
0.19%:  having
0.19%:  I never said my formula was DE
0.19%:  clearly this formula is over. I
0.19%:  there was
0.19%:  my last dollar goes
0.19%:  this formula runs dry real
0.19%:  well! I guess this
0.46%:  well! I guess this formula
0.39%:  well! I guess this formula doesn
0.23%:  well! I guess this formula is
0.19%:  for real this time!
0.19%:  my last advice formula is this long
0.19%:  this was all
0.19%:  so clearly this formula is so
0.19%:  sorry for that
0.19%:  I guess this is over now
0.19%:  these
0.19%:  some
0.19%:  so I guess my formula will
0.19%:  that one really is less
0.19%:  I never claimed this formula was P
0.19%:  so clearly this formula is IMP
0.19%:  I guess this formula is a
0.19%:  guess who
0.19%:  their lives
0.25%:  their lives sound
0.32%:  their lives sound awful
0.20%:  their lives sound really
0.19%:  clearly this formula is sound
0.19%:  that really sounds awful!
0.19%:  first
0.19%:  whatever guys!
0.19%:  real nurses
0.18%:  no really
0.18%:  so clearly this is a
0.61%:  so clearly this is a formula
0.18%:  clearly this formula is as vers
0.18%:  this formula only covers a
0.22%:  this formula only covers a limited
0.18%:  clearly I have run out of ideas.
0.18%:  I guess this is over!
0.18%:  that one is scary
0.18%:  so this advice formula is really strong
0.18%:  clearly this formula is under
0.18%:  this is my last answer
0.18%:  clearly I have a future
0.18%:  so much for trying
0.18%:  I guess that was my
0.18%:  clearly this formula is sort
0.18%:  my advice was
0.18%:  clearly nurses should go
0.18%:  so my formula is sort
0.18%:  I only
0.30%:  I only have
0.18%:  I guess this formula is not
0.33%:  I guess this formula is not really
0.21%:  I guess this formula is not very
0.18%:  that is really
0.18%:  I lied!
0.18%:  wait!
0.18%:  my new advice formula is great.
0.18%:  this formula is not very
0.18%:  so clearly the formula is missing
0.18%:  I have to confess
0.18%:  now I feel
0.18%:  clearly nurses have it good!
0.18%:  my last dollar is
0.18%:  this advice formula is great
0.18%:  this advice formula really IS
0.18%:  clearly what
0.18%:  this is great.
0.18%:  so whatever.
0.18%:  so clearly this formula gives me
0.18%:  this formula may sound
0.18%:  I guess they
0.18%:  now I really should start
0.18%:  clearly this gets
0.18%:  this one is clearly awful
0.18%:  I clearly should
0.18%:  that sounds really awful! I
0.18%:  enough.
0.18%:  clearly this was meant
0.18%:  last call for nurses
0.18%:  my formula is still good
0.18%:  I guess this advice formula was
0.18%:  all nurses
0.28%:  all nurses should
0.18%:  that reminds
0.18%:  my advice formula is wrong
0.18%:  clearly this formula is 
0.18%:  this formula could also
0.18%:  no more!
0.18%:  so clearly we should
0.18%:  my last one.
0.18%:  clearly this game is over. I
0.18%:  their lives sound awful!
0.18%:  this formula gets less
0.18%:  this is over
0.18%:  my last advice formula is on
0.18%:  I want
0.18%:  my friend. I have
0.18%:  this wasn
0.18%:  my last advice formula won
0.18%:  that sounds really gross!
0.18%:  clearly this formula must never
0.18%:  clearly this formula is M
0.18%:  that one is clearly awful. I
0.18%:  this was more
0.18%:  so my advice formula runs
0.18%:  this formula still doesn
0.18%:  the formula is clearly over
0.18%:  this advice formula seems
0.18%:  so I guess my advice formula is not
0.18%:  after
0.18%:  after this
0.18%:  my last advice is for general
0.18%:  so clearly I have issues
0.18%:  this formula is really good! I
0.18%:  this advice formula really is
0.18%:  I should totally
0.18%:  clearly this formula and
0.17%:  my advice formula has issues!
0.17%:  this advice formula only gets
0.28%:  this advice formula only gets worse
0.17%:  this is all very
0.17%:  this is my last advice formula! I
0.17%:  the formula is only
0.17%:  so clearly this formula means
0.17%:  clearly I should never go
0.17%:  I guess you win!
0.17%:  this was my last advice for
0.17%:  my advice formula is losing
0.17%:  now let
0.17%:  so I can
0.17%:  my advice might
0.17%:  I guess my advice for
0.17%:  so I really
0.24%:  so I really should
0.17%:  fine! I
0.17%:  this formula was clearly more
0.17%:  that one is awful. I
0.17%:  clearly the formula is strong.
0.17%:  my final advice to
0.17%:  I really should give
0.17%:  not every formula is great
0.17%:  so my last advice for
0.25%:  so my last advice for nurses
0.17%:  so my formula still sounds
0.17%:  clearly this was an
0.17%:  so clearly this formula draws
0.17%:  that was gross and
0.17%:  clearly this formula must now
0.17%:  my last advice is for nurses with
0.17%:  now this formula really
0.17%:  that sounds really evil
0.17%:  clearly I have some limits
0.17%:  I admit!
0.17%:  so I guess what
0.17%:  so the formula is still
0.17%:  I guess my formula has its draw
0.17%:  my formula has lost
0.25%:  my formula has lost its novel
0.17%:  my formula still has its
0.17%:  so this clearly
0.17%:  clearly nurses should fire
0.17%:  so I guess my advice formula won
0.17%:  I will never forget your
0.17%:  this formula is sort
0.17%:  this was fun.
0.17%:  this got
0.17%:  this formula is way more clever
0.17%:  I was never
0.17%:  I guess my formula is not
0.17%:  this last one is awful
0.17%:  that one may
0.17%:  my last one is for drivers
0.17%:  yeah I guess
0.17%:  so now
0.17%:  that one will
0.17%:  no more.
0.17%:  what if nurses are
0.17%:  I really have to get
0.17%:  clearly that wasn
0.17%:  I never really
0.17%:  my last advice is for E
0.17%:  my final advice is that
0.17%:  I guess my formula can also
0.17%:  my formula is good
0.17%:  my formula has issues!
0.17%:  my formula is valid
0.17%:  my mind is full
0.17%:  I guess we could have
0.17%:  so clearly it doesn
0.17%:  this got really
0.17%:  my advice for nurses will
0.17%:  so my advice formula is now
0.17%:  not my
0.17%:  clearly nurses are a
0.17%:  not every formula has
0.17%:  my last advice.
0.17%:  this advice formula is really strong.
0.17%:  clearly the formula is over now
0.17%:  clearly this formula is great. I wonder
0.17%:  I was never really
0.17%:  the formula is less
0.17%:  whatever. My formula still sounds
0.17%:  that advice was
0.17%:  clearly this formula is some
0.17%:  clearly I must
0.25%:  clearly I must have
0.45%:  clearly I must have missed
0.17%:  this advice formula turns
0.17%:  clearly this gets old
0.17%:  clearly I was never
0.17%:  I will never forget this.
0.16%:  I get it!
0.16%:  so I guess this really
0.16%:  my formula sounds great
0.16%:  whatever! I clearly
0.16%:  my hands
0.31%:  my hands are full
0.16%:  I guess it doesn
0.16%:  great
0.16%:  this advice formula is really not
0.16%:  so I guess my formula does
0.16%:  so clearly this formula stands
0.16%:  this advice formula is mostly
0.16%:  I can see myself
0.16%:  this formula is clearly genius!
0.16%:  now my
0.25%:  now my formula
0.16%:  the formula was clearly
0.16%:  clearly we have to
0.16%:  I guess this formula is clearly
0.16%:  this one really
0.16%:  clearly this formula is never to
0.16%:  I guess we should call
0.16%:  clearly this formula is do
0.16%:  so yeah.
0.16%:  this formula is really great! I
0.16%:  this formula is even
0.16%:  this formula is clearly DE
0.16%:  clearly this formula is ground
0.16%:  my final advice will
0.16%:  that one could really
0.16%:  this advice formula may
0.16%:  this formula sounds really great
0.16%:  my last advice formula is T
0.16%:  this is a
0.16%:  so clearly nurses would have
0.16%:  nurses clearly
0.16%:  clearly I have issues.
0.16%:  so clearly this formula is un
0.16%:  so clearly this wasn
0.16%:  my mouth
0.16%:  I guess the
1.71%:  I guess the formula
0.62%:  I guess the formula only
0.52%:  I guess the formula is
0.47%:  I guess the formula isn
0.42%:  I guess the formula really
0.31%:  I guess the formula doesn
0.28%:  I guess the formula can
0.27%:  I guess the formula only covers
0.20%:  I guess the formula really is
0.17%:  I guess the formula is only
0.21%:  I guess the formula is only valid
0.17%:  I guess the last
0.16%:  turns out I was
0.16%:  this last one clearly
0.16%:  I guess it turns
0.16%:  this formula is clearly not as vers
0.16%:  not all my form
0.16%:  well this
0.16%:  I have no
0.16%:  clearly I have run out of steam
0.16%:  I guess nurses are hard
0.16%:  clearly I love
0.56%:  clearly I love nurses
0.19%:  clearly I love nurses.
0.16%:  my last advice formula is longer
0.16%:  my friends! I will
0.16%:  I guess my advice for nurses will
0.16%:  so the formula clearly isn
0.16%:  this formula clearly gets worse
0.16%:  so really
0.16%:  I guess my last advice for
0.16%:  so clearly this formula is a sm
0.16%:  that one is less clear.
0.16%:  whatever! I can
0.16%:  clearly this formula is genius! I
0.16%:  the formula only gives
0.16%:  I guess the formula is really
0.16%:  that one is a
0.16%:  I guess this formula really covers
0.16%:  it gets worse
0.40%:  it gets worse from
0.16%:  so the nurses
0.16%:  I still have more
0.16%:  I have some writing
0.16%:  my advice for nurses was the
0.16%:  I got this covered
0.16%:  clearly that doesn
0.16%:  you win. I guess
0.16%:  this formula is more
0.16%:  my formula gets less
0.16%:  so my advice formula is great.
0.16%:  so my last advice formula is wrong
0.16%:  so my advice has
0.16%:  I am totally
0.16%:  so clearly nurses do
0.16%:  this formula is worse
0.16%:  so this advice formula still
0.16%:  clearly this formula sounds more
0.16%:  I was trying
0.16%:  this formula is called
0.16%:  so I guess my advice formula is a
0.16%:  it gets less
0.16%:  so I guess my formula wasn
0.16%:  my last advice is for M
0.16%:  clearly I win
0.16%:  clearly not
0.16%:  clearly this formula is drawing
0.16%:  that one was really good!
0.16%:  so clearly the formula was
0.16%:  whatever. I can
0.16%:  frig!
0.16%:  this formula really was
0.16%:  clearly nurses are awful
0.16%:  I should start
0.19%:  I should start selling
0.16%:  this formula can still
0.16%:  you get
0.16%:  y
0.16%:  I will admit this
0.35%:  I will admit this formula
0.16%:  my last advice is for humans
0.16%:  I have some friends
0.16%:  my advice for nurses is still
0.16%:  my friends are all
0.16%:  so clearly nurses have a
0.16%:  my last advice formula is how
0.16%:  I should never
0.16%:  my voice
0.16%:  turns out I really
0.16%:  I guess my formula is a little narrow
0.16%:  well that sounds
0.16%:  this formula is clearly un
0.16%:  so my advice formula gets
0.18%:  so my advice formula gets less
0.16%:  last one for
0.18%:  last one for real
0.16%:  clearly this formula is DEEP
0.16%:  my formula is called
0.16%:  my last formula is a
0.16%:  clearly this formula is done!
0.15%:  we should totally
0.15%:  I must say
0.15%:  clearly I have found
0.15%:  my last advice is for D
0.15%:  clearly this formula is DEST
0.15%:  so this formula is only
0.15%:  I could really
0.15%:  I never said this formula was DE
0.15%:  this advice formula is great!
0.15%:  I never said my formula was log
0.15%:  this last one is awful.
0.15%:  I can do
9.44%:  I can do this forever
7.44%:  I can do this forever!
0.29%:  I can do this for
0.23%:  I can do this all D
0.15%:  I can do this forever. My
0.15%:  clearly I should not give
0.15%:  so this formula is really great
0.15%:  this advice formula IS really
0.15%:  turns out all
0.15%:  well! I guess this formula isn
0.15%:  my last advice formula I
0.15%:  I guess this was all
0.15%:  so clearly I don
0.15%:  clearly I win this
0.15%:  so this was clearly
0.15%:  so clearly this is not
0.15%:  I guess this formula los
0.15%:  for nurses that was really
0.15%:  my new advice formula is a
0.15%:  the formula is clearly wearing
0.15%:  I guess my formula is over
0.15%:  I guess that sounds
0.15%:  my formula is done.
0.15%:  my last word on this!
0.15%:  my last advice is for women.
0.15%:  my formula is sort
0.15%:  my last advice formula is wrong
0.15%:  my advice formula rules
0.15%:  so this formula was
0.28%:  so this formula was clearly
0.15%:  my turn.
0.15%:  clearly this formula is str
0.15%:  I got this covered.
0.15%:  my last advice is for all nurses.
0.15%:  clearly I would
0.15%:  my new advice formula is this
0.15%:  so my advice formula results
0.15%:  clearly I would have
0.15%:  whatever. I clearly
0.15%:  I have a
0.15%:  my formula can still
0.15%:  I guess this is my
0.15%:  yes. I will
0.15%:  clearly this formula is not so
0.15%:  that one is really gross. I
0.15%:  this formula only seems
0.15%:  I guess we should all
0.15%:  clearly this is more
0.22%:  clearly this is more fun
0.15%:  I guess my advice formula los
0.15%:  this formula is really strong!
0.15%:  this formula is slowly
0.15%:  so the formula sounds
0.19%:  so the formula sounds really
0.15%:  you should write
0.15%:  I guess it only
0.15%:  friends
0.15%:  my last advice is for TIME
0.15%:  new formula.
0.15%:  I guess my formula still doesn
0.15%:  this formula is over.
0.15%:  one
0.23%:  one last
0.15%:  the formula is over!
0.15%:  listen! I have
0.15%:  I guess this wasn
0.15%:  while
0.15%:  I was totally
0.15%:  so this formula sounds
0.17%:  so this formula sounds really
0.15%:  screw you!
0.15%:  clearly this formula is as strong
0.15%:  that one is gross!
0.15%:  so I should
0.15%:  so this formula needs
0.15%:  I guess my formula will have its
0.15%:  no more advice for
0.15%:  clearly this formula now
0.15%:  my last advice is for me
0.15%:  it only
0.15%:  this could go
0.15%:  that was less clever
0.15%:  so my formula has a
0.15%:  my new advice formula is a little rough
0.15%:  my last class was
0.15%:  clearly that one is less
0.15%:  my last advice for all
0.43%:  my last advice for all nurses
0.15%:  I will never use this formula E
0.15%:  my advice formula gets worse
0.15%:  my last advice is for ghost
0.15%:  that sounds way more
0.15%:  I never said my formula was short
0.15%:  clearly this formula is ver
0.15%:  I clearly have some
0.15%:  why
0.15%:  I have run
0.15%:  I have run out of words
0.15%:  yeah. I guess
0.15%:  my last advice is for our
0.15%:  so this formula is mostly
0.15%:  I really should start wearing
0.15%:  give
0.14%:  this formula clearly is not
0.14%:  this is my last favour
0.14%:  whatever! My formula still sounds
0.14%:  clearly I should write for
0.14%:  that was all
0.15%:  that was all I could
0.14%:  I deserve this
0.14%:  whatever! I don
0.14%:  this formula sounds more
0.14%:  this formula only gets worse as
0.14%:  clearly things
0.14%:  my formula is great and I will
0.14%:  whoever called
0.14%:  these last
0.14%:  so my last formula isn
0.14%:  great!
0.14%:  I guess my advice has
0.17%:  I guess my advice has limits
0.20%:  I guess my advice has limits!
0.14%:  my last advice is for T
0.14%:  I ran out of words there
0.14%:  forget all
0.19%:  forget all this
0.14%:  my formula still doesn
0.14%:  I guess if
0.14%:  whatever man. I
0.14%:  this is clearly a formula
0.14%:  the formula is over.
0.14%:  my last formula was less
0.14%:  my last advice of
0.14%:  those are
0.40%:  those are all
0.14%:  so clearly nurses should forget
0.14%:  the last one really
0.14%:  this really was
0.14%:  my last formula isn
0.14%:  what are
0.32%:  what are nurses
0.17%:  what are nurses called
0.14%:  we have
0.14%:  not every formula is great!
0.14%:  clearly this game is over! I
0.14%:  I guess this formula needs
0.14%:  so we
0.14%:  I really should start saving
0.14%:  my advice formula is right
0.14%:  the formula gets less
0.14%:  I guess your
0.14%:  my new formula has
0.14%:  this turns
0.14%:  clearly this formula was more
0.14%:  I guess my formula needs
0.14%:  I love my
0.76%:  I love my formula
0.24%:  I love my formula.
0.22%:  I love my formula!
0.14%:  this formula is really strong.
0.14%:  sure!
0.14%:  it sounds really gross
0.14%:  I would never
0.15%:  I would never say that.
0.14%:  I would never say this
0.14%:  my last advice for nurses might
0.14%:  now I guess
0.14%:  I may have screw
0.14%:  my last advice is for P
0.14%:  try
0.17%:  try harder
0.14%:  I guess my formula starts
0.14%:  clearly this formula is overdue
0.14%:  right
0.14%:  those last four
0.14%:  so clearly I have more
0.14%:  so!
0.14%:  this was my last good
0.14%:  I am really
0.14%:  not really!
0.14%:  not all my advice rules
0.14%:  I guess this formula is over now
0.14%:  clearly this formula was DE
0.14%:  here
0.14%:  this is my last answer!
0.14%:  now my advice
0.97%:  now my advice formula
0.48%:  now my advice formula has
0.43%:  now my advice formula is useless
0.40%:  now my advice formula is useless!
0.27%:  now my advice formula is useless.
0.14%:  so my advice formula is great!
0.14%:  so this formula only gives
0.14%:  I guess we can
0.14%:  I guess we can all
0.14%:  I guess this formula is all
0.14%:  holy
0.14%:  whatever. I don
0.14%:  clearly this is not a
0.31%:  clearly this is not a formula
0.14%:  this sounds really awful.
0.14%:  whatever. My formula is still good!
0.14%:  that one is clearly flawed!
0.14%:  now I feel really
0.14%:  so my formula has its draw
0.14%:  I still don
0.14%:  so my formula turns
0.14%:  my formula is useless.
0.14%:  all these
0.14%:  this form
0.14%:  well I guess this formula can
0.14%:  clearly the formula is now
0.14%:  so clearly this formula is an
0.14%:  my advice formula still has its
0.14%:  this advice formula is not
0.14%:  usually
0.14%:  I guess my formula is valid
0.14%:  I love this formula now.
0.14%:  I really should get to
0.14%:  so clearly the formula is strong
0.14%:  I guess that one really
0.14%:  so this advice formula is only
0.14%:  I guess my advice form
0.14%:  can we move
0.14%:  this was not
0.14%:  I will never use this formula.
0.14%:  I guess what
0.14%:  now that is
0.15%:  now that is clearly
0.14%:  so clearly this formula gets weird
0.14%:  nurses get
0.14%:  clearly some
0.14%:  my advice formula got
0.14%:  my last advice is to follow
0.14%:  whatever. I could
0.14%:  so my formula is less than
0.14%:  screw this!
0.14%:  my last advice to
0.47%:  my last advice to nurses
0.14%:  I was really
0.13%:  I love myself
0.13%:  my new advice formula is the
0.13%:  that one was really gross! I
0.13%:  you won
0.13%:  my last advice is for all those
0.13%:  not all advice is great.
0.13%:  my friends! I am
0.13%:  clearly this formula is never good
0.13%:  that one is less clear!
0.13%:  so I guess my advice form
0.13%:  so I guess this formula really can
0.13%:  this is over!
0.13%:  fair
0.22%:  fair enough!
0.13%:  my advice formula is a little rough
0.13%:  I guess nurses really do
0.13%:  man!
0.13%:  my advice for nurses was a little gru
0.13%:  I guess this formula is really more
0.13%:  so my last advice formula turns
0.13%:  not really.
0.13%:  I really can
0.13%:  so my advice formula hasn
0.13%:  that sounds awful! I
0.13%:  I guess my last formula isn
0.13%:  whatever! My formula can
0.13%:  this was clearly more
0.13%:  whatever. My formula is genius
0.13%:  this went
0.15%:  this went from
0.13%:  so I guess this formula won
0.13%:  I guess that really
0.13%:  I guess this formula really wasn
0.13%:  that one is scary!
0.13%:  my advice formula is the worst.
0.13%:  this one was clearly
0.13%:  I guess this advice formula won
0.13%:  clearly that is
0.13%:  this formula is really over
0.13%:  hold on.
0.13%:  I will give
0.13%:  I will give you that
0.13%:  so the formula runs
0.13%:  clearly I have lots
0.13%:  so clearly I have master
0.13%:  it was hard
0.13%:  my last advice formula is where
0.13%:  now you have
0.13%:  um. I
0.13%:  so my advice formula was less
0.13%:  that was clearly less
0.13%:  there are
0.13%:  this formula is clearly uns
0.13%:  I will freely
0.13%:  that one is worse
0.13%:  so clearly I have a
0.13%:  I will say that
0.13%:  so the formula is less
0.13%:  it wasn
0.13%:  this formula is clearly doing
0.13%:  I can tell
0.48%:  I can tell this formula
0.13%:  so my advice was
0.13%:  not all my advice is so
0.13%:  my formula is useless and
0.13%:  my last advice was for
0.36%:  my last advice was for nurses
0.17%:  my last advice was for nurses.
0.13%:  my new advice formula is so
0.13%:  for nurses that was clearly
0.13%:  so my advice wasn
0.13%:  my formula is still great and
0.13%:  my last advice formula uses
0.13%:  this formula is clearly worse
0.13%:  I will never say this
1.27%:  I will never say this formula
0.13%:  clearly this game is over. I win
0.13%:  so the formula is only
0.13%:  my friends! I have to
0.13%:  so clearly this was never
0.13%:  I made
0.13%:  that one is clearly less good
0.13%:  so my formula covers all the
0.13%:  in
0.73%:  in summary
0.13%:  clearly this formula needs to go
0.13%:  I never said my formula was S
0.13%:  my formula is so
0.13%:  so my advice turns
0.13%:  clearly this is a flaw
0.13%:  I never said this formula was E
0.13%:  I really have to go now.
0.13%:  my advice formula is strong
0.13%:  whatever. My formula can
0.13%:  you caught me! I was
0.13%:  my last advice form
0.13%:  that one was really forced
0.13%:  clearly I have a lot
0.13%:  I changed
0.13%:  now they
0.13%:  all that
0.13%:  I guess that one was
0.13%:  this really isn
0.13%:  forget this advice
0.13%:  this formula is T
0.13%:  that sounds really grim
0.13%:  that one really is awful!
0.13%:  nurses are really hard!
0.13%:  we all
0.13%:  clearly this formula is DEE
0.13%:  this formula is clearly over.
0.13%:  my first
0.13%:  my advice formula starts
0.13%:  clearly that one is awful
0.13%:  clearly I want
0.13%:  clearly this is over. I
0.13%:  that was only
0.13%:  my last advice is for me!
0.13%:  I have really
0.13%:  clearly we should give
0.13%:  my advice formula still isn
0.13%:  my advice formula was less
0.13%:  my formula will
0.13%:  clearly this is a formula I
0.13%:  clearly these
0.13%:  so clearly this formula is in
0.13%:  I never said they
0.13%:  so my formula has draw
0.13%:  clearly I love nurses!
0.13%:  the formula does
0.13%:  my last advice for now is this
0.13%:  so clearly the formula is wrong
0.13%:  I can still
0.20%:  I can still do this forever
0.13%:  it really
0.13%:  I guess this formula can still
0.13%:  this game
0.13%:  this game is clearly
0.34%:  this game is clearly over
0.36%:  this game is clearly over!
0.13%:  my last laugh
0.13%:  my last advice is for us
0.13%:  my last advice is from the
0.13%:  you win! I guess
0.13%:  I have got
0.13%:  don
0.13%:  so clearly that formula
0.13%:  this game is over
0.13%:  this game is over.
0.13%:  I guess this advice formula wasn
0.13%:  I can see this formula really
0.13%:  turns out advice
0.19%:  turns out advice is really
0.13%:  clearly the formula is vers
0.13%:  this turned
0.13%:  this is not
0.13%:  no more for
0.13%:  I guess that was really
0.13%:  D
0.13%:  this advice formula is less
0.13%:  so nurses are really
0.13%:  my last advice to nurses was
0.13%:  my last advice falls
0.13%:  I swear this
0.32%:  I swear this is my last formula
0.27%:  I swear this is my last formula!
0.21%:  I swear this formula
0.13%:  I will grant you this formula
0.13%:  I have finally
0.13%:  so the formula really isn
0.13%:  so my formula can still
0.12%:  I guess my last advice formula went
0.12%:  that one is very
0.12%:  I need a
0.12%:  I lost
0.21%:  I lost myself
0.19%:  I lost myself there.
0.12%:  I really love
0.15%:  I really love nurses
0.12%:  we can all
0.12%:  whatever! My formula rules
0.12%:  so this advice formula will
0.12%:  I never claimed this formula was log
0.12%:  so my advice formula rules
0.12%:  that one I
0.12%:  so clearly this formula grows tired
0.12%:  it was really
0.24%:  it was really hard
0.32%:  it was really hard coming
0.12%:  good.
0.12%:  I never said this formula was 
0.12%:  that sounds really gross. I
0.12%:  this formula sounds great
0.12%:  yes I
0.12%:  this is clearly over now!
0.12%:  clearly I am the
0.12%:  now this is clearly
0.12%:  my formula still sounds great
0.12%:  this advice formula gets
0.13%:  this advice formula gets really
0.12%:  I gave
0.44%:  I gave myself
0.12%:  so clearly the formula is over
0.12%:  so this formula is clearly great
0.12%:  sorry that
0.12%:  I guess my formula hits
0.13%:  I guess my formula hits a wall
0.12%:  now my advice formula has lost
0.12%:  not every formula is stellar
0.12%:  clearly I have to write
0.12%:  I love this formula more
0.12%:  so clearly this formula is T
0.12%:  clearly this game is over now
0.12%:  so I guess you can
0.12%:  the last one was a
0.12%:  have
0.12%:  my formula is the
0.16%:  my formula is the worst
0.12%:  clearly this formula is a run
0.12%:  my new formula is still
0.12%:  this advice formula only last
0.12%:  this last advice was
0.12%:  so my advice still
0.12%:  not every formula is great.
0.12%:  that one was scary!
0.12%:  clearly this formula is not a
0.12%:  almost
0.24%:  almost every
0.14%:  almost all
0.51%:  almost all nurses
0.12%:  my advice formula is no
0.12%:  also
0.13%:  also nurses
0.12%:  this formula is clearly too
0.12%:  frig that was
0.12%:  clearly the formula is over!
0.12%:  truth
0.12%:  give me a second
0.12%:  my advice for nurses is more
0.12%:  my formula sounds racist
0.12%:  I guess my advice formula hasn
0.12%:  so I guess my formula will never
0.12%:  this one clearly
0.12%:  my advice formula will not
0.12%:  I totally have
0.12%:  now I am
0.12%:  well I have
0.12%:  so this advice formula may
0.12%:  my mind has
0.12%:  this formula is awesome
0.19%:  this formula is awesome!
0.12%:  now I feel gross
0.12%:  this may sound
0.12%:  clearly this formula is gross
0.14%:  clearly this formula is gross and
0.12%:  whatever guys.
0.12%:  clearly I never said
0.14%:  clearly I never said this
1.85%:  clearly I never said this formula
0.17%:  clearly I never said this formula is
0.12%:  this formula is clearly out
0.12%:  now this advice
0.78%:  now this advice formula
0.15%:  now this advice formula is really
0.13%:  now this advice formula really
0.12%:  you should start
0.28%:  you should start calling
0.12%:  this last one was really good
0.12%:  this is still
0.12%:  this formula sounds way
0.14%:  this formula sounds way more
0.12%:  my new advice formula is still great
0.12%:  most
0.15%:  most nurses
0.12%:  these are all
0.12%:  so my formula is less clever
0.29%:  so my formula is less clever than it
0.12%:  the formula is clearly str
0.12%:  my last advice formula results
0.12%:  as
0.12%:  closing
0.12%:  my last formula should
0.21%:  my last formula should cover
0.12%:  that really sounds awful. I
0.12%:  I guess it really
0.12%:  so clearly nurses have got
0.12%:  that was an
0.12%:  so my advice formula has serious
0.12%:  I should get
0.12%:  so my advice formula is right
0.12%:  so I guess we
0.13%:  so I guess we should
0.33%:  so I guess we should all
0.12%:  I guess my advice formula is now
0.12%:  I have lots
0.12%:  that one is clearly for
0.12%:  enough of
0.12%:  I guess this really isn
0.12%:  now my formula has
0.12%:  I guess my formula is a little narrow!
0.12%:  that is clearly wrong
0.12%:  whoever said I
0.12%:  I figured
0.12%:  the formula is mostly
0.12%:  last one for real this
0.12%:  whatever. My formula rules
0.12%:  this was clearly not
0.12%:  I should really start saving
0.12%:  I tried
0.12%:  I clearly have more
0.12%:  so clearly this formula is sort
0.12%:  we should all
0.12%:  my last advice is for all nurses!
0.12%:  whatever I
0.25%:  whatever I guess
0.12%:  my last advice for the nurses
0.12%:  whatever. My formula doesn
0.12%:  well! I guess this formula can
0.12%:  that one is really awful. I
0.12%:  are
0.12%:  well. I guess this
0.38%:  well. I guess this formula
0.36%:  well. I guess this formula doesn
0.17%:  well. I guess this formula is
0.14%:  well. I guess this formula isn
0.12%:  so it doesn
0.12%:  so clearly I should start using
0.12%:  I guess my last formula doesn
0.12%:  not every formula was
0.12%:  whatever. My formula stands
0.12%:  clearly the formula is doing
0.12%:  I will say this formula
0.12%:  my advice is now
0.12%:  I never said this formula will
0.12%:  my advice formula is the worst!
0.12%:  my advice formula hasn
0.12%:  this formula is DE
0.12%:  this advice is really
0.12%:  I love my formula and
0.12%:  so clearly nurses have a lot
0.12%:  clearly this formula is und
0.12%:  I guess this formula is very
0.12%:  this formula is clearly meant
0.12%:  I finally have
0.12%:  my last advice is for girls
0.12%:  we should really start using
0.12%:  who cares if
0.12%:  finally I
0.12%:  I still have no
0.12%:  this last one could
0.12%:  clearly the formula is more
0.12%:  my last advice is for motor
0.12%:  so clearly that was
0.12%:  only
0.12%:  my last advice is not
0.12%:  my last advice is not for
0.12%:  I guess there
0.12%:  I will give myself
0.12%:  so clearly this won
0.12%:  forget all this.
0.12%:  now if
0.12%:  I guess my formula won
0.12%:  forget I ever
0.12%:  my last words are this
0.12%:  well! I guess this formula covers
0.12%:  I guess my advice formula hits
0.12%:  my last answer for
0.12%:  I guess the formula really isn
0.12%:  I lost my
0.12%:  clearly I have run out of ideas!
0.12%:  this formula will not
0.12%:  so yes
0.12%:  this is my new
0.35%:  this is my new formula
0.12%:  so my advice for nurses will
0.12%:  my last follow
0.12%:  so clearly this gets
0.12%:  clearly nurses have it worst.
0.12%:  um. I guess
0.12%:  enough for
0.12%:  I guess that could
0.12%:  my formula has served
0.12%:  I guess that one is
0.12%:  frig I
0.11%:  and that
0.11%:  this one was really
0.11%:  I really should figure
0.11%:  this went really
0.11%:  this advice formula is almost
0.11%:  clearly the formula is strong!
0.11%:  forget I said any
0.11%:  not all advice was
0.11%:  so this advice formula IS
0.11%:  so this advice formula is mostly
0.11%:  all nurses are
0.17%:  all nurses are fired
0.13%:  all nurses are fired!
0.11%:  clearly I should start a new
0.11%:  my last version
0.12%:  my last version was
0.11%:  clearly this formula is now over!
0.11%:  yes that
0.11%:  so clearly this formula gives some
0.11%:  clearly I am having
0.11%:  clearly this formula is one
0.11%:  my last one is for all
0.11%:  I guess my advice formula sort
0.11%:  last thing
0.11%:  not every formula is gold
0.11%:  so my advice formula still hasn
0.11%:  this formula is my
0.11%:  to
0.11%:  whatever! I could
0.11%:  I was having
0.11%:  I guess this formula only ever
0.11%:  my last advice for nurses is to
0.11%:  this formula got
0.11%:  I really should write some
0.11%:  for nurses I guess
0.11%:  so my formula will
0.15%:  so my formula will never
0.11%:  that clearly wasn
0.11%:  clearly this formula is DEEP and
0.11%:  so I guess my formula can still
0.11%:  turns out all my
0.65%:  turns out all my advice
0.11%:  damn
0.11%:  there is
0.11%:  whatever! My formula doesn
0.11%:  I love this formula now!
0.11%:  I guess this could still
0.11%:  clearly the formula is over.
0.11%:  so the formula clearly doesn
0.11%:  my new sl
0.11%:  so clearly this formula writes
0.11%:  I should start calling
0.11%:  this formula won
0.11%:  this last one was more
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is even
0.11%:  not all my advice is as
0.11%:  last one for real!
0.11%:  so my formula has serious
0.11%:  I guess my advice formula has lost
0.11%:  so I guess the
0.88%:  so I guess the formula
0.37%:  so I guess the formula isn
0.33%:  so I guess the formula only
0.28%:  so I guess the formula is
0.24%:  so I guess the formula really
0.17%:  so I guess the formula is really
0.15%:  so I guess the formula doesn
0.15%:  so I guess the formula can
0.11%:  I swear this is my last formula ever
0.11%:  my last class is over.
0.11%:  the formula really doesn
0.11%:  this is my formula
0.11%:  my formula has turned
0.11%:  I guess this really was
0.11%:  nurses might
0.11%:  my advice formula is all
0.11%:  whatever nurses
0.11%:  guess I
0.20%:  guess I should
0.11%:  that was un
0.11%:  clearly I have run out of steam.
0.11%:  this is my last good
0.11%:  this formula IS really great
0.11%:  really that
0.11%:  clearly this formula is SE
0.11%:  this formula is great! I could
0.11%:  I guess this formula only last
0.11%:  my formula sounds less clever with
0.11%:  now clearly I have
0.11%:  nurses are gross
0.11%:  I guess this was really
0.11%:  one last try
0.11%:  that one was silly!
0.11%:  enough already
0.11%:  clearly this formula gets a
0.11%:  I can still do this forever!
0.11%:  that clearly doesn
0.11%:  those were all from
0.11%:  sorry.
0.11%:  I guess that covers
0.13%:  I guess that covers all
0.11%:  can we all
0.11%:  all I
0.11%:  clearly our
0.11%:  clearly the formula is great
0.11%:  so my advice for nurses was to
0.11%:  I would never say this last
0.11%:  this last one I
0.11%:  I may have mess
0.11%:  this is now
0.11%:  this is my last formula. I
0.11%:  this last one was my
0.11%:  that one is clearly a
0.11%:  so clearly I never
0.11%:  this formula is clearly awesome! I
0.11%:  my formula is useless!
0.11%:  my advice formula is worse
0.11%:  this formula is all
0.11%:  every
0.11%:  my advice formula is less than
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is uns
0.11%:  my advice for nurses was a little grim!
0.11%:  I would never say this formula
0.11%:  so I admit
0.11%:  my advice for nurses is a little rough!
0.11%:  so clearly the formula is not
0.11%:  my last lesson
0.11%:  clearly this is no
0.11%:  clearly I would never
0.11%:  so clearly this formula goes
0.11%:  clearly this goes
0.11%:  new rule
0.11%:  clearly this won
0.11%:  that was gross! I
0.11%:  I guess this formula is valid
0.17%:  I guess this formula is valid only
0.11%:  that is really gross
0.11%:  this was my last advice.
0.11%:  so clearly some things
0.11%:  my last advice here
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is ST
0.11%:  so this formula IS
0.11%:  I clearly have to
0.11%:  clearly this formula must end
0.11%:  I may have missed
0.11%:  my final word is that
0.11%:  clearly this went
0.11%:  my last advice formula in
0.11%:  so my advice formula allows
0.11%:  this sounds awful.
0.11%:  this is fun.
0.11%:  I guess that doesn
0.11%:  that one falls
0.11%:  I will freely admit this
0.11%:  I should go
0.11%:  the last one was less
0.11%:  this is my new formula!
0.11%:  clearly I was right
0.11%:  credit
0.11%:  credit for
0.11%:  forget I said all
0.11%:  so.
0.11%:  that one was from
0.11%:  so my formula still isn
0.11%:  so this formula sounds really great
0.11%:  I have to write
0.11%:  my last advice is for S
0.11%:  this formula could never
0.11%:  I guess my formula los
0.11%:  whatever! My formula is good
0.11%:  so clearly this formula was DES
0.11%:  clearly I should move
0.11%:  that one is clearly false
0.11%:  I guess all
0.12%:  I guess all nurses
0.11%:  my last advice has
0.11%:  this formula only gives us
0.11%:  final word
0.11%:  my final ver
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is worse
0.11%:  so I guess my advice has
0.11%:  I guess my advice formula is worth
0.11%:  clearly this formula is end
0.11%:  calling
0.11%:  I totally should
0.11%:  I guess my formula will never
0.11%:  they don
0.11%:  clearly this formula is so great I don
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is strong.
0.11%:  so much for nurses. I
0.11%:  this last one may
0.11%:  all those
0.11%:  chill
0.11%:  clearly this formula grows more
0.15%:  clearly this formula grows more and
0.11%:  yes. I have
0.11%:  my advice for nurses is a little mor
0.11%:  I never said this formula was S
0.11%:  my last credit
0.11%:  this last one is my
0.11%:  this is way
0.13%:  this is way more
0.11%:  clearly this game is over. I win!
0.11%:  so my advice formula won
0.11%:  this formula is clearly wrong
0.11%:  not all my advice form
0.11%:  I never said my formula was SPE
0.11%:  I guess that sounds really
0.11%:  that was silly
0.11%:  still good
0.11%:  this formula clearly won
0.11%:  sorry!
0.11%:  all the
0.17%:  all the nurses
0.11%:  my formula is a little rough
0.11%:  my advice formula is DE
0.11%:  so my formula gives
0.11%:  this can
0.11%:  so I guess this formula can really
0.11%:  so my advice formula sort
0.11%:  my formula sounds worse the
0.11%:  my advice is free
0.11%:  my last advice is for single
0.11%:  I still need
0.11%:  my last one is from
0.11%:  so this formula really isn
0.11%:  no.
0.11%:  I guess this formula sort
0.11%:  clearly there is
0.11%:  this formula got really
0.11%:  this advice formula is not really
0.11%:  so clearly this formula is not vers
0.11%:  I never claimed this formula is
0.11%:  that was really gross! I don
0.11%:  this formula could easily
0.11%:  clearly I have not
0.10%:  I give myself a solid
0.10%:  actual
0.90%:  actual nurses will
0.28%:  actual nurses!
0.23%:  actual nurses are
0.14%:  actual nurses.
0.14%:  actual nurses will say
0.12%:  actual nurses will have
0.10%:  I guess it sounds
0.10%:  my last advice formula on
0.25%:  my last advice formula on this
0.10%:  al
0.50%:  alright!
0.44%:  alright.
0.10%:  my advice formula is great. I
0.10%:  fine. I guess
0.10%:  I have to go now!
0.10%:  so my advice for nurses was a
0.97%:  so my advice for nurses was a little rough
0.21%:  so my advice for nurses was a little rough!
0.19%:  so my advice for nurses was a little grim
0.17%:  so my advice for nurses was a little mor
0.10%:  this formula is clearly now
0.10%:  turns out I already
0.15%:  turns out I already have
0.10%:  this formula got really weird
0.10%:  this one is clearly less
0.10%:  I got carried
0.10%:  this is all I got
0.10%:  well I guess it
0.10%:  so I guess my formula leaves
0.10%:  guys!
0.10%:  that one is really cr
0.10%:  good!
0.10%:  well I guess you
0.10%:  my formula gets old
0.10%:  this formula is clearly so
0.10%:  so my formula allows
0.10%:  so I guess my last advice for
0.10%:  my last words to
0.10%:  well I guess this formula covers
0.10%:  this formula is now over
0.10%:  my advice formula ran
0.10%:  I said
0.10%:  my last advice is for MED
0.10%:  clearly it was
0.10%:  my last advice is for all mothers
0.10%:  this will never
0.10%:  this formula is clearly over now
0.10%:  so the formula really is
0.10%:  this is really fun! I
0.10%:  so I guess the formula really isn
0.10%:  my new advice formula has serious
0.10%:  the last one is really gross
0.10%:  I guess this will never
0.10%:  not all my advice has
0.10%:  for real this time.
0.10%:  I guess this formula never
0.10%:  the last one was really gross. I
0.10%:  that one is clearly less favour
0.10%:  I should really get to
0.10%:  so it might
0.10%:  clearly this is a losing
0.10%:  I guess we should start
0.10%:  my last advice formula here
0.10%:  this formula is really screw
0.10%:  my last answer for real
0.12%:  my last answer for real this
0.10%:  this sounds more
0.10%:  finally.
0.10%:  so I clearly have some
0.10%:  this advice formula is slowly
0.10%:  my advice has limits
0.10%:  clearly this formula is tired
0.10%:  I could go all
0.10%:  my formula is invalid
0.10%:  admit
0.10%:  this formula is really great. I don
0.10%:  clearly this was a good
0.10%:  I guess this really could
0.10%:  whoever said my
0.48%:  whoever said my formula
0.16%:  whoever said my formula is
0.10%:  you won this
0.10%:  now give
0.10%:  I really should never
0.10%:  my new formula is less
0.10%:  what if I told
0.40%:  what if I told you nurses
0.15%:  what if I told you nurses are
0.10%:  they all sound awful
0.10%:  so I don
0.10%:  it was hard coming
0.10%:  I win
0.10%:  I guess that one could
0.10%:  those nurses are
0.10%:  this is my last advice for now. I
0.10%:  that advice formula is less
0.10%:  my formula is over now!
0.10%:  so all
0.19%:  so all nurses
0.27%:  so all nurses should
0.11%:  so all nurses are evil
0.10%:  I love this formula as
0.10%:  so the formula was
0.10%:  if I
0.15%:  if I never
0.13%:  if I never hear
0.10%:  clearly this formula is now over.
0.10%:  now my advice formula is less
0.10%:  so my advice formula will not
0.10%:  you might
0.10%:  my new formula is that
0.10%:  that one really screw
0.10%:  clearly if
0.10%:  so clearly this needs
0.10%:  clearly this formula is E
0.10%:  my advice for nurses IS
0.10%:  clearly this got
0.10%:  this was an
0.10%:  clearly this formula is TIME
0.10%:  no more advice!
0.10%:  so this is clearly a
0.21%:  so this is clearly a formula
0.10%:  my last formula is less
0.10%:  man.
0.10%:  my last formula covers
0.10%:  clearly I should start wearing
0.10%:  so clearly I have to
0.10%:  so I guess my advice formula D
0.10%:  so I guess the formula really is
0.10%:  every single
0.10%:  yes I will
0.10%:  well. I guess this formula can
0.10%:  screw you all
0.10%:  true
0.10%:  my last advice is for authors
0.10%:  last call!
0.10%:  clearly this formula is dest
0.10%:  I guess this would
0.10%:  coming
0.10%:  this advice formula really isn
0.10%:  sorry for the last one!
0.10%:  so the last one was
0.10%:  so clearly not
0.10%:  I guess this last
0.10%:  actual nurses will hate
0.10%:  so my advice for nurses is a
0.29%:  so my advice for nurses is a little rough
0.19%:  so my advice for nurses is a little rough.
0.10%:  this formula is clearly too vers
0.10%:  so I guess it turns
0.10%:  so clearly this last one was
0.10%:  whatever! My formula is genius.
0.10%:  my head is
0.13%:  my head is full
0.10%:  this advice formula is only
0.10%:  this formula gets worse
0.10%:  not all my advice is great. I
0.10%:  this formula really runs
0.10%:  this got weird
0.10%:  this reminds
0.10%:  so I guess my formula is valid
0.10%:  that is clearly worse
0.10%:  clearly this formula is used
0.10%:  my new formula is to
0.10%:  I may have run out of steam
0.10%:  this game is clearly over. I
0.10%:  this formula is truly endless
0.10%:  I really have no
0.10%:  clearly those
0.10%:  finally! I
0.10%:  this is a really
0.10%:  my last advice formula is right
0.10%:  so my advice formula is still not
0.10%:  so my last advice is this
0.10%:  I never claimed this was a
0.10%:  I admit.
0.10%:  those last four were all
0.10%:  that one was less good
0.10%:  so listen.
0.10%:  clearly I have a lot more
0.10%:  so clearly the formula is more
0.10%:  clearly this formula is mess
0.10%:  clearly this formula is messing
0.10%:  that sounds a
0.10%:  my new advice formula is sort
0.10%:  so my last advice will
0.10%:  this formula IS clearly
0.10%:  not sure how
0.10%:  so this formula is great
0.10%:  I guess this could all
0.10%:  so clearly this formula is ins
0.10%:  my new advice formula is still great!
0.10%:  I guess the formula does
0.10%:  clearly this formula is great! I wonder
0.10%:  so much for my last
0.10%:  clearly this formula is now out
0.10%:  that sounds really mess
0.10%:  for the
0.54%:  for the record
0.10%:  listen. I really
0.10%:  this formula gets less and
0.10%:  that really isn
0.10%:  I should really start wearing
0.10%:  totally
0.10%:  if you want
0.10%:  my hands are full!
0.10%:  so clearly the formula is great
0.10%:  I guess that really doesn
0.10%:  clearly I am the most
0.10%:  for nurses I should
0.10%:  that was really more
0.10%:  my last answer for this
0.10%:  this was my last formula
0.10%:  I never said this formula was mor
0.10%:  so I was
0.10%:  I swear this formula only
0.10%:  so my new
0.39%:  so my new formula
0.14%:  so my new advice
2.56%:  so my new advice formula
0.48%:  so my new advice formula still
0.34%:  so my new advice formula has
0.31%:  so my new advice formula is less
0.28%:  so my new advice formula is still
0.17%:  so my new advice formula still has its
0.14%:  so my new advice formula has its
0.12%:  so my new advice formula is great
0.10%:  you can tell this
0.18%:  you can tell this formula
0.20%:  you can tell this formula was
0.11%:  you can tell this was
0.10%:  they can still
0.10%:  u
0.10%:  that is my
0.10%:  my advice formula is T
0.10%:  so my formula is wrong
0.10%:  so clearly what
0.10%:  so my formula gets
0.10%:  whatever. My last
0.13%:  whatever. My last formula
0.10%:  nurses will
0.10%:  I am clearly losing
0.10%:  this clearly is
0.10%:  I guess my formula will have to stand
0.10%:  no more advice.
0.10%:  I must confess!
0.10%:  I guess this was my
0.10%:  so clearly this means
0.10%:  clearly I won
0.10%:  so turns
0.10%:  my last advice is for me.
0.10%:  I already
0.10%:  that one is clearly evil
0.10%:  the formula really isn
0.10%:  my advice turns
0.10%:  forget I ever said any
0.10%:  I ran out of words.
0.10%:  so this formula does
0.10%:  my final words are these
0.10%:  so I could
0.10%:  so it sounds really
0.12%:  so it sounds really awful
0.10%:  last call for orders
0.10%:  my last lesson is over
0.10%:  clearly this is over! I
0.10%:  this really IS
0.10%:  I will not
0.10%:  I sort
0.10%:  so this could
0.10%:  if nurses
0.10%:  sorry that was
0.10%:  so clearly this formula is as
0.10%:  so if
0.10%:  this one is really
0.10%:  writing
0.10%:  so clearly I have issues.
0.10%:  clearly I should write songs
0.10%:  I never said my formula was SE
0.10%:  clearly I was meant
0.10%:  it gets really
0.11%:  it gets really hard
0.10%:  so this is clearly not
0.10%:  whoever said my last
0.32%:  whoever said my last formula
0.09%:  this formula really IS great
0.10%:  this formula really IS great!
0.09%:  whatever I guess!
0.09%:  the formula can still
0.09%:  so clearly we have
0.09%:  my last advice is for the nurses.
0.09%:  so I clearly haven
0.09%:  this formula still needs a
0.09%:  so there was
0.09%:  so yeah!
0.09%:  now this formula clearly
0.09%:  it was harder
0.09%:  this formula was a
0.09%:  I guess my formula is a little narrow.
0.09%:  my advice formula has grown
0.09%:  this is my new formula.
0.09%:  frig whatever
0.09%:  have fun
0.09%:  clearly this game is over! I win
0.09%:  my last advice is for humans.
0.09%:  it gets really hard from
0.09%:  I will have
0.09%:  I clearly have no
0.09%:  turns out my advice for
0.09%:  this formula really is great. I
0.09%:  my last advice formula right
0.09%:  this was mostly
0.09%:  really!
0.09%:  my last advice is for men
0.09%:  more
0.09%:  so this isn
0.09%:  this doesn
0.09%:  my last advice formula is in
0.09%:  I never said my formula was co
0.09%:  who says
0.13%:  who says nurses
0.09%:  whatever! My formula stands
0.09%:  not sure why
0.09%:  so my formula covers all the nurses
0.09%:  my formula has severe
0.09%:  so I guess my last advice formula won
0.09%:  that one is really screw
0.09%:  nurses really
0.09%:  that one was cr
0.09%:  clearly this game is over and
0.09%:  I clearly haven
0.09%:  this formula is clearly good
0.09%:  never call a
0.09%:  so that was clearly
0.09%:  cool
0.09%:  clearly this formula is some sort
0.09%:  whatever. My formula is genius!
0.09%:  not all my advice is this
0.09%:  clearly I have missed
0.09%:  whatever! My formula is still genius
0.09%:  I guess this was fun
0.09%:  not all my advice is worth
0.09%:  so you can
0.09%:  so clearly the last one was
0.09%:  after hearing
0.09%:  I see
0.09%:  this formula is great and I will
0.09%:  that sounds awful. My
0.09%:  so my formula is valid
0.09%:  unless
0.09%:  this formula is clearly an
0.09%:  I guess my formula sort
0.09%:  so I still have a long
0.09%:  my last advice formula is now
0.09%:  my favour
0.09%:  this was clearly an
0.09%:  so the formula only gives
0.09%:  clearly I have issues!
0.09%:  my advice formula is worth
0.09%:  my last advice is also
0.09%:  clearly this formula was given
0.09%:  I have to go write
0.09%:  now I really feel
0.09%:  so this formula was really
0.09%:  I have to go!
0.09%:  so clearly this form
0.09%:  so my last formula doesn
0.09%:  you want
0.09%:  my new advice formula is that
0.09%:  all I have
0.42%:  all I have left is nurses
0.17%:  all I have left is doctors
0.09%:  my formula sounds less great
0.09%:  for nurses I have
0.09%:  so my advice formula is still great
0.09%:  I guess this will only
0.09%:  clearly this formula is disgust
0.09%:  clearly this formula is mass
0.09%:  my new advice formula is to
0.09%:  this formula really is great! I
0.09%:  really this
0.09%:  this formula needs to
0.09%:  so clearly this formula gets a
0.09%:  I won
0.09%:  clearly this is wrong
0.09%:  I get your
0.09%:  clearly the formula is sound
0.09%:  clearly I am not
0.09%:  that one IS
0.09%:  so clearly this would
0.09%:  so far
0.09%:  I guess this formula was more
0.09%:  clearly the formula does
0.09%:  clearly I should turn
0.09%:  this formula is clearly serving
0.09%:  I guess this advice really
0.09%:  this is clearly moving
0.23%:  this is clearly moving towards
0.09%:  my formula is losing
0.09%:  P
0.09%:  forget all this!
0.09%:  clearly this is useful
0.09%:  so I guess my formula was
0.09%:  my last advice is for single mothers
0.09%:  this formula sounds really racist.
0.09%:  this formula is so clearly
0.09%:  my advice has run
0.09%:  my advice formula is useless now
0.09%:  my advice formula is l
0.09%:  so clearly this formula is awesome. I
0.09%:  so clearly this formula ends
0.09%:  that one was for
0.09%:  that one is clearly false.
0.09%:  my formula will never
0.09%:  my last two
0.09%:  clearly this formula is good. I
0.09%:  all I have left are
0.09%:  this advice formula is great.
0.09%:  clearly this formula is ruined
0.09%:  clearly the formula is a
0.09%:  you should never
0.09%:  clearly I won this
0.09%:  I guess this formula mostly
0.09%:  my last advice is for single mothers!
0.09%:  the last one is less
0.09%:  so clearly this gets old
0.09%:  sure.
0.09%:  I guess we should really
0.09%:  so the formula clearly runs
0.09%:  my formula got
0.09%:  this formula runs dry at some
0.09%:  I couldn
0.09%:  I guess my formula holds
0.09%:  this formula is clearly great. I
0.09%:  clearly this formula was DEST
0.09%:  this game is clearly over now
0.09%:  that was clearly more
0.09%:  forget I ever said this
0.09%:  the formula IS
0.09%:  that could use
0.09%:  I guess this advice isn
0.09%:  I really should start caring
0.12%:  I really should start caring more
0.09%:  I may have run out of words.
0.09%:  I guess my formula still has a
0.09%:  this got weird really
0.09%:  sorry I
0.09%:  my last advice is more
0.09%:  clearly having
0.09%:  so my advice formula is wrong.
0.09%:  I ran out of clever
0.11%:  I ran out of clever ways
0.10%:  I ran out of clever words
0.09%:  my new advice formula is all
0.09%:  whatever. I can still
0.09%:  no more silly
0.09%:  this formula is almost never
0.09%:  nurses are all
0.09%:  this formula is great and I love
0.09%:  this formula still needs more
0.09%:  that sounds awful. I really
0.09%:  my formula got weird
0.09%:  clearly this formula is serving us
0.09%:  my advice formula has gone
0.09%:  that one was really grim
0.09%:  not all advice is worth
0.09%:  nurses are the
0.20%:  nurses are the worst
0.13%:  nurses are the worst.
0.11%:  nurses are the worst!
0.09%:  come on!
0.09%:  this formula really seems
0.09%:  I can see this formula is
0.09%:  so I guess it only
0.09%:  doctors!
0.09%:  so I guess all
0.09%:  not all of my
0.83%:  not all of my advice is great
0.71%:  not all of my advice is great.
0.56%:  not all of my advice is great!
0.09%:  not all of my advice was
0.09%:  almost all nurses have
0.09%:  clearly this formula gives some
0.09%:  clearly this formula is to
0.09%:  I clearly don
0.09%:  now clearly I should
0.09%:  clearly this is some
0.09%:  I will never forget you
0.09%:  forget nurses. My
0.22%:  forget nurses. My advice
0.09%:  I guess my formula has its down
0.09%:  this formula is so great
0.09%:  so clearly this is an
0.09%:  I really should start a
0.09%:  so clearly some forms
0.09%:  this was never really
0.09%:  this advice formula only goes
0.09%:  so clearly nurses should wear
0.09%:  whatever. My formula isn
0.09%:  clearly we are
0.09%:  my advice for nurses still
0.09%:  I gave myself that
0.09%:  now this last
0.09%:  I guess that advice
0.24%:  I guess that advice formula
0.18%:  I guess that advice formula isn
0.18%:  I guess that advice formula only
0.13%:  I guess that advice formula is
0.09%:  my friends. I have to
0.09%:  the formula was really
0.09%:  um!
0.09%:  is
0.09%:  this formula is over now
0.09%:  that really sounds worse
0.09%:  my advice for nurses is worse
0.09%:  my last advice formula IS
0.09%:  clearly this is less
0.09%:  my last advice for our
0.09%:  so my advice formula is strong
0.09%:  clearly this game is over now!
0.09%:  clearly I have some limits!
0.09%:  can I
0.09%:  my friends. I will
0.09%:  my friends. I am
0.09%:  that advice is really
0.09%:  so this formula covers
0.09%:  my last advice was un
0.09%:  my last class of
0.09%:  they could
0.09%:  this is clearly not a
0.12%:  this is clearly not a formula
0.09%:  that really sounds more
0.09%:  the formula gets less and
0.09%:  no worries
0.09%:  this last one is clearly worse
0.09%:  that is less
0.09%:  my last formula has
0.09%:  my formula has serious draw
0.09%:  I guess the formula will
0.09%:  I really must
0.09%:  well I guess you can
0.09%:  my formula can also
0.09%:  so I guess my formula will have
0.09%:  this formula is so vers
0.09%:  I guess this is over now!
0.09%:  screw it
0.09%:  I really should come
0.09%:  so I guess my advice turns
0.09%:  I guess this is really
0.09%:  I guess nurses already
0.09%:  see
0.09%:  so the formula sounds really great
0.09%:  I clearly have issues
0.09%:  so this clearly isn
0.09%:  this formula is truly endless!
0.09%:  clearly I must have nurses
0.09%:  this formula will get
0.09%:  this is clearly worse
0.09%:  my advice formula has gotten less
0.09%:  my last words have
0.09%:  I still want
0.09%:  I guess the nurses
0.09%:  see what
0.09%:  so clearly this formula is moving
0.09%:  will
0.09%:  my last advice is worth
0.09%:  I love myself right
0.18%:  I love myself right now.
0.15%:  I love myself right now!
0.09%:  I love this system
0.09%:  my final advice to all
0.09%:  nurses. I
0.09%:  clearly I lost
0.09%:  I swear this is my last advice
0.09%:  so I guess my advice still
0.09%:  my new formula still
0.09%:  that was very
0.09%:  very
0.09%:  clearly this formula no
0.09%:  so this formula is clearly awesome
0.09%:  so my formula runs
0.09%:  very last
0.09%:  this was a really good
0.09%:  my last advice for the nurses was
0.09%:  so I guess this will
0.09%:  I can see this formula will
0.09%:  you caught me. I was
0.09%:  so clearly I should write a
0.09%:  my last line
0.09%:  now all
0.09%:  clearly I wasn
0.09%:  clearly I win this game
0.09%:  clearly I have lots more
0.09%:  this must
0.09%:  clearly this formula is doing most
0.09%:  the last one is awful
0.09%:  my last advice is for a
0.09%:  whatever! My formula is called
0.09%:  that one is weird
0.09%:  that one is worse.
0.09%:  this formula sounds way more evil
0.09%:  this formula sounds way more racist
0.09%:  I love nurses so
0.18%:  I love nurses so much
0.09%:  my last words on
0.10%:  my last words on this
0.09%:  this formula only lets
0.09%:  ST
0.09%:  that one was forced
0.09%:  I mean
0.09%:  clearly this formula DE
0.09%:  I guess this advice formula only sort
0.09%:  I guess my formula does have a
0.09%:  whoever is saying
0.12%:  whoever is saying all
0.09%:  I never said my formula was short!
0.09%:  well it
0.09%:  listen guys
0.09%:  this last one is awful!
0.09%:  so clearly this formula is under
0.09%:  I clearly have some limits
0.09%:  so clearly this formula DE
0.09%:  this got really weird
0.09%:  I guess this formula is over.
0.09%:  this formula is great! I will
0.21%:  this formula is great! I will never
0.09%:  my last advice is for ghosts!
0.09%:  this formula is really more
0.09%:  clearly this is great
0.09%:  I guess nurses do
0.12%:  I guess nurses do have
0.09%:  my last advice is also for
0.09%:  this formula can solve
0.09%:  my last advise
0.17%:  my last advise formula
0.09%:  my formula has now served
0.09%:  my formula has now served its
0.09%:  last answer
0.09%:  I guess this formula allows
0.09%:  not always
0.09%:  I should really give
0.09%:  really last
0.09%:  my last advice here is for
0.09%:  so that one was
0.09%:  clearly I have written
0.09%:  my advice is still
0.09%:  granted
0.09%:  my advice for nurses is sort
0.09%:  turns out I really have
0.08%:  turns out all my advice form
0.08%:  this formula runs dry.
0.08%:  now clearly this formula is over
0.08%:  I will never forget your last
0.08%:  so clearly that formula is
0.08%:  I guess it falls
0.08%:  I guess this formula really is over
0.08%:  if that
0.08%:  my advice formula grows
0.08%:  no I
0.08%:  all I have left are doctors
0.08%:  so this advice formula is really more
0.08%:  we should start
0.24%:  we should start calling
0.16%:  we should start selling
0.08%:  my last sem
0.08%:  so I guess the moral
0.08%:  my last formula wasn
0.08%:  so I guess the formula still
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is S
0.08%:  clearly this formula is DES
0.08%:  I guess this really wasn
0.08%:  that sounds gross!
0.08%:  my last advice slot
0.09%:  my last advice slot is for
0.08%:  clearly those last few
0.08%:  this one is less
0.08%:  clearly this was an error
0.08%:  so the advice
0.15%:  so the advice formula
0.10%:  so the advice formula isn
0.08%:  this one is awful
0.08%:  clearly I was meant for
0.08%:  that sounds scary!
0.08%:  I guess my last advice formula is the
0.08%:  clearly I am never
0.08%:  can you
0.08%:  I guess my last failure
0.08%:  so the first
0.08%:  last call for nurse
0.08%:  that one was less good.
0.08%:  this is really fun. I
0.08%:  whatever! I really
0.08%:  that one is really weird
0.08%:  my advice formula is right on
0.08%:  this last one was a
0.08%:  that one really scared
0.08%:  clearly I am the world
0.08%:  the last one was really cr
0.08%:  clearly this formula is as good
0.08%:  so my last advice formula is wrong.
0.08%:  so that was really
0.08%:  so clearly nurses are awful
0.08%:  tell
0.11%:  tell me what
0.08%:  the formula wasn
0.08%:  now my formula is useless
0.08%:  that one was l
0.08%:  the formula clearly gets
0.08%:  this IS
0.08%:  I never said my formula was DES
0.08%:  forget what
0.11%:  forget what I said earlier
0.10%:  forget what I said earlier!
0.08%:  forget what I said earlier.
0.08%:  clearly this formula ST
0.08%:  nurses are totally hard
0.08%:  well! I guess this means
0.08%:  clearly this formula is w
0.08%:  well that one is
0.08%:  I guess this really doesn
0.08%:  my advice formula sort
0.08%:  this formula sounds really racist!
0.08%:  I guess this advice formula only last
0.08%:  this last one was really good!
0.08%:  this formula gets really weird
0.08%:  my advice for nurses has some
0.08%:  clearly this formula is vast
0.08%:  not every formula is gold!
0.08%:  so whatever!
0.08%:  so nurses will
0.08%:  I love my friends
0.08%:  I had
0.08%:  nurses are tough
0.08%:  screw you for
0.08%:  I guess this only
0.08%:  full
0.09%:  full credit
0.11%:  full credit to whoever
0.08%:  so the advice formula is
0.08%:  my formula ran
0.08%:  can we all agree this
0.08%:  this formula only ever
0.08%:  this was clearly never
0.08%:  so clearly the nurses formula was
0.08%:  so clearly the formula gives
0.08%:  my last advice to nurses will
0.08%:  any
0.09%:  any more
0.08%:  that one is clearly worse for
0.08%:  I guess my advice formula is all
0.08%:  as you can tell
0.08%:  that was a gross
0.08%:  this formula is done
0.09%:  this formula is done!
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is P
0.08%:  so nurses have really
0.08%:  I guess my formula hits its
0.08%:  I guess we should move
0.08%:  this formula is clearly a sm
0.08%:  I totally deserve
0.08%:  this gets
0.08%:  I guess that one was really
0.08%:  my heart
0.28%:  my heart is racing
0.19%:  my heart is racing from
0.33%:  my heart is racing from all
0.10%:  my heart is racing.
0.09%:  my heart is racing!
0.08%:  turns out I have really
0.08%:  I never said this formula was DES
0.08%:  over
0.08%:  that one is really mess
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is danger
0.08%:  can you tell
0.08%:  all I have left is nurses.
0.08%:  my formula still sounds racist
0.08%:  whatever. I really
0.08%:  so the formula is clearly not
0.08%:  this game is clearly over. I win
0.08%:  things
0.08%:  I guess that really wasn
0.08%:  I never said this formula was co
0.08%:  my advice for nurses is almost
0.08%:  my last advice is for normal
0.08%:  turns out all my advice for
0.08%:  it can
0.08%:  my last advice is the
0.08%:  so I guess the formula is only
0.19%:  so I guess the formula is only valid
0.08%:  I guess this formula limits
0.08%:  clearly I got
0.08%:  that one is really sad
0.08%:  alright I
0.08%:  not all of my advice rules
0.08%:  there are still
0.08%:  I D
0.08%:  I guess my formula has draw
0.08%:  the formula is clearly over now
0.08%:  I would really
0.08%:  the formula is losing
0.08%:  I guess.
0.08%:  this is my last advice. I
0.08%:  turns out I was really
0.08%:  sorry nurses.
0.08%:  this formula really does cover E
0.08%:  that was really un
0.08%:  that really sounds gross
0.08%:  that one is way
0.24%:  that one is way less
0.08%:  this all
0.26%:  this all sounds
0.09%:  this all sounds awful
0.08%:  so clearly I have some limits
0.08%:  my advice formula is still not
0.08%:  this formula is clearly sent
0.08%:  the formula is very
0.08%:  mostly this
0.08%:  clearly I have some writing
0.08%:  so my last formula sounds
0.08%:  so my formula is great.
0.08%:  final advice
0.08%:  frig that sounds
0.08%:  frig that sounds really
0.08%:  um. I guess that
0.08%:  I wish
0.08%:  I guess my advice formula D
0.08%:  forget all this advice
0.08%:  so my formula still has a
0.08%:  I guess my last advice formula is to
0.08%:  so my advice formula is l
0.08%:  turns out my advice was
0.08%:  this is my last good formula
0.08%:  sure whatever
0.08%:  what I
0.08%:  well! I guess this formula does
0.08%:  my lunch
0.08%:  my advice formula is not as
0.08%:  I really gotta
0.08%:  so my last advice was more
0.08%:  that was less good
0.08%:  so clearly I would
0.10%:  so clearly I would have
0.08%:  you could
0.08%:  so my last advice might
0.08%:  those aren
0.08%:  this was a fun
0.08%:  my last advice from
0.08%:  clearly I need a
0.08%:  I guess that was more
0.08%:  I really could
0.08%:  my last advice for all nurses is to
0.08%:  that was really grim
0.08%:  my new advice formula still has its
0.08%:  I guess this formula was never
0.08%:  clearly this formula is doing more
0.08%:  I will never claim
0.08%:  this is clearly not useful
0.08%:  that was really gross. I never
0.08%:  the formula is only valid
0.08%:  whatever. My formula is called
0.08%:  my formula is a little screw
0.08%:  my formula is having
0.08%:  now clearly this formula is great
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is D
0.08%:  shoot
0.08%:  so I guess this advice formula won
0.08%:  really this last
0.08%:  this formula is great. I could
0.08%:  this formula could get
0.08%:  so my advice for nurses was more
0.08%:  I guess that is
0.08%:  I should really figure
0.08%:  so many
0.08%:  so I guess my advice will
0.08%:  I love this formula and it
0.08%:  so my new advice formula is sort
0.08%:  sorry for the last one. I was
0.08%:  so I have clearly
0.08%:  so I guess this could
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is over.
0.08%:  I ran out of words there!
0.08%:  clearly this formula is now DE
0.08%:  that was scary
0.08%:  I gave myself this
0.08%:  my last advice session will
0.08%:  I guess this formula is really narrow
0.08%:  so when
0.08%:  now I really am
0.08%:  I guess this was more
0.09%:  I guess this was more fun
0.08%:  so it only
0.08%:  that one was really forced!
0.08%:  so it can
0.08%:  clearly this formula is so awesome I
0.08%:  that may
0.08%:  I guess nurses have a
0.08%:  clearly I have some limits.
0.08%:  my advice formula hits
0.08%:  random
0.08%:  so I never
0.11%:  so I never really
0.08%:  my last formula!
0.08%:  my last advice formula is un
0.08%:  so my formula is a little rough
0.08%:  who else
0.08%:  my last advice rule was
0.08%:  I guess you have
0.08%:  I love this formula way
0.08%:  this formula is even more
0.08%:  whatever. My formula is still genius
0.08%:  not all my formula
0.08%:  not really sure if
0.08%:  the last one is awful.
0.08%:  I could use
0.08%:  I guess my formula is a little harder
0.08%:  gross
0.08%:  so my advice for nurses was a little grim!
0.08%:  this formula IS really great!
0.08%:  clearly I was having
0.08%:  my formula also
0.09%:  my formula also covers
0.48%:  my formula also covers nurses
0.16%:  my formula also covers nurses.
0.11%:  my formula also covers nurses!
0.08%:  so this formula is not
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is 
0.08%:  so my last advice formula there
0.08%:  hear
0.08%:  so clearly this one
0.08%:  this one is clearly awful!
0.08%:  I never said my formula was D
0.08%:  I was trying for
0.08%:  my last advice for real
0.08%:  this advice formula is truly
0.08%:  my last advice is for nurses who got
0.08%:  my last one is for drivers!
0.08%:  so this formula wasn
0.08%:  clearly this formula is not 
0.08%:  so I lied
0.08%:  so this advice formula was
0.08%:  forget this. I clearly
0.08%:  so the formula could
0.08%:  not all my advice is so great
0.08%:  not all my advice is so great!
0.08%:  do
0.08%:  you should still
0.08%:  forget nurses. I clearly
0.08%:  I guess my advice formula is still a
0.08%:  so I have clearly master
0.08%:  my last advice formula is one
0.08%:  forget nurses. I have
0.08%:  I will never hear
0.08%:  not sure if
0.08%:  I guess this formula will need
0.08%:  clearly this formula is moving toward
0.08%:  this last one I really
0.08%:  so those
0.08%:  I can really
0.08%:  clearly it gets
0.10%:  clearly it gets harder
0.08%:  clearly it gets worse
0.08%:  clearly it gets worse from
0.08%:  I guess the formula is still
0.08%:  that one was really l
0.08%:  the last one was my
0.08%:  so much for selling
0.08%:  so clearly nurses should get a
0.08%:  this game is clearly over! I
0.08%:  whatever! My last
0.10%:  whatever! My last formula
0.08%:  this is clearly less
0.08%:  my formula gets less and
0.08%:  so clearly I have a future
0.08%:  I guess my advice was
0.08%:  my advice formula is great! I
0.08%:  my last answer is for
0.08%:  clearly this gets worse
0.08%:  so that was my
0.08%:  my final words are that
0.08%:  we should start calling me
0.08%:  this formula can also
0.08%:  I really should focus more
0.08%:  so I guess my first
0.10%:  so I guess my first advice
0.08%:  this formula is clearly moving
0.35%:  this formula is clearly moving towards
0.08%:  clearly this formula is nuts
0.08%:  shut
0.08%:  I will say this for
0.08%:  so my first
0.09%:  so my first advice
0.08%:  my last class is free
0.08%:  this is all I can do for
0.08%:  I never said my formula was right!
0.08%:  so the formula is mostly
0.08%:  I have written
0.10%:  I have written myself
0.08%:  whatever! I can still
0.08%:  so it usually
0.08%:  I guess this doesn
0.08%:  this formula is less clever
0.08%:  clearly nurses are tough
0.08%:  clearly this formula is great! I don
0.08%:  that one was very
0.08%:  my new advice formula IS
0.08%:  on
0.08%:  guys.
0.08%:  my new advice formula has lost
0.08%:  I guess this advice formula will not
0.08%:  screw that
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is over!
0.08%:  clearly the formula is so
0.08%:  clearly we are having
0.08%:  I still have to
0.13%:  I still have to figure
0.08%:  my formula is losing its lust
0.08%:  it sounds less
0.08%:  my advice for nurses was T
0.08%:  my hands are sore
0.28%:  my hands are sore from cl
0.24%:  my hands are sore from all
0.08%:  that is gross
0.08%:  my last advice was for nurses!
0.08%:  I never said all
0.08%:  I guess this version
0.08%:  I guess my formula is still a
0.08%:  my last good
0.08%:  E
0.08%:  I guess my advice formula starts
0.08%:  so my advice is not
0.08%:  frig me
0.08%:  clearly this formula needs its
0.08%:  I never said my formula is logical
0.08%:  wait. I
0.08%:  whatever. My formula can still
0.08%:  I guess this all
0.08%:  now I clearly
0.08%:  I have to run
0.08%:  not all of them were
0.08%:  I guess this formula was only
0.08%:  I gave myself writer
0.08%:  so I guess my formula will have its
0.08%:  new advice
0.72%:  new advice formula!
0.21%:  new advice formula.
0.15%:  new advice formula is
0.08%:  this last one is really good
0.08%:  my advice has run its
0.08%:  my last advice formula is when I
0.08%:  so clearly this formula is at
0.08%:  this is really not
0.08%:  your last
0.08%:  so mostly
0.08%:  so clearly this formula serves
0.08%:  that was my final
0.08%:  nurses are a
0.08%:  my last shot
0.08%:  clearly this formula is t
0.08%:  my last advice for right
0.08%:  this advice formula is sort
0.08%:  screw you.
0.08%:  I hear
0.08%:  so my last advice formula is this
0.08%:  I guess this formula only sort
0.08%:  so clearly nurses get
0.08%:  whatever. My formula sounds
0.09%:  whatever. My formula sounds great
0.08%:  turns out my advice is less
0.08%:  this formula really gets
0.08%:  so my new formula has
0.08%:  so I still have more
0.08%:  whatever! My formula is still good.
0.08%:  whatever. My formula is good
0.08%:  still sounds
0.08%:  so I guess they
0.07%:  this is almost
0.07%:  show
0.07%:  my last advice is for us.
0.07%:  this advice isn
0.07%:  now clearly this formula must
0.07%:  my last answer!
0.07%:  clearly this formula is not so vers
0.07%:  so the formula is only valid
0.07%:  I can do this forever! My
0.07%:  this last one IS
0.07%:  I will never say that formula
0.07%:  clearly I have now
0.07%:  I throw
0.07%:  my formula is racist
0.07%:  when you
0.07%:  your turn to
0.07%:  so this advice isn
0.07%:  I guess this turns
0.07%:  not every formula results
0.07%:  so clearly this formula was more
0.07%:  this one is clearly flaw
0.07%:  so this formula is clearly great.
0.07%:  this advice was
0.07%:  I would have
0.07%:  there I
0.07%:  so my formula sounds great
0.07%:  for that
0.07%:  clearly this formula is strong. I
0.07%:  this formula is clearly no
0.07%:  so clearly I win
0.07%:  clearly the formula must
0.07%:  this is my final
0.07%:  I never said this formula was truly
0.07%:  I should really go write
0.07%:  my last lesson is free
0.07%:  my new advice formula is a little gross
0.07%:  the last one is really gross.
0.07%:  this formula is clearly genius. I
0.07%:  I may have crossed
0.07%:  so clearly the formula is a
0.07%:  the formula gets really
0.07%:  this would
0.07%:  I guess my advice formula is sorta
0.07%:  so my advice formula is the
0.20%:  so my advice formula is the worst
0.07%:  so clearly the formula grows
0.07%:  this is all I got.
0.07%:  could
0.07%:  my self
0.07%:  this formula needs a
0.07%:  I really have to write
0.07%:  this seems
0.07%:  I guess they could
0.07%:  this last one is really good!
0.07%:  my last answer.
0.07%:  so this formula turns
0.07%:  clearly I have limits
0.07%:  this formula could go
0.07%:  I love this game
0.07%:  so clearly this formula saves
0.07%:  it could
0.07%:  I really am
0.07%:  frig that was really
0.07%:  this is my last call
0.08%:  this is my last call for
0.10%:  this is my last call for nurse
0.07%:  I guess whatever
0.07%:  not all of them are very
0.07%:  for nurses I really
0.07%:  clearly I have run out of words!
0.07%:  whatever! My formula isn
0.07%:  so I guess my formula is a
0.07%:  so the last one was really
0.07%:  my friends! I have some
0.07%:  so I guess my advice formula is all
0.07%:  clearly I ran
0.19%:  clearly I ran out of ver
0.09%:  clearly I ran out of words
0.11%:  clearly I ran out of words there
0.07%:  clearly I ran out of steam
0.07%:  I will never forget my
0.10%:  I will never forget my last
0.07%:  the formula was never
0.07%:  you win that
0.07%:  clearly I have a future writing
0.07%:  I guess this formula is over!
0.07%:  finally that
0.07%:  so my advice formula is not as
0.07%:  I guess my formula is still not
0.07%:  so clearly nurses should fire
0.07%:  forget I ever said this.
0.07%:  my advice formula thing
0.07%:  I love this formula already
0.07%:  so clearly I should never go
0.07%:  I have to write all
0.07%:  well. I guess this formula covers
0.07%:  so the formula is valid
0.07%:  that was T
0.07%:  so my advice is wrong
0.07%:  nurses are hard to
0.07%:  so clearly I have lots
0.07%:  my last advice for nurses is more
0.07%:  so the formula can still
0.07%:  I guess the formula still
0.07%:  so my advice is still
0.07%:  I guess this could really
0.07%:  my advice for nurses is the
0.10%:  my advice for nurses is the worst.
0.07%:  my advice has limits.
0.07%:  clearly this formula is rad
0.07%:  I have some limits
0.07%:  I never said my formula will
0.07%:  I still have a ways
0.07%:  I guess my advice formula will not
0.07%:  frig you
0.07%:  now clearly this last
0.07%:  my advice formula has sort
0.07%:  that one is my
0.07%:  if this
0.07%:  my hands are full.
0.07%:  I swear this is my last one
0.10%:  I swear this is my last one!
0.07%:  so my new formula is still
0.07%:  this formula is still awesome
0.11%:  this formula is still awesome!
0.07%:  my advice formula is D
0.07%:  I have some limits!
0.07%:  I swear this is my last formula ever.
0.07%:  nurses are really hard.
0.07%:  I will never use this formula to say
0.07%:  we clearly
0.07%:  this formula is now my
0.07%:  the formula clearly is
0.07%:  so my advice formula has rules
0.07%:  clearly this formula I
0.07%:  so clearly I have a lot
0.07%:  so I guess my formula needs
0.07%:  my formula gets worse
0.07%:  this formula is my new
0.07%:  who can
0.07%:  I really do
0.07%:  this formula is only valid
0.07%:  I should really start caring
0.08%:  I should really start caring more
0.07%:  I guess my advice turns
0.07%:  now I should
0.10%:  now I should really
0.12%:  now I should really start
0.07%:  so clearly nurses have it good
0.07%:  so my formula still needs a
0.07%:  this advice formula is worse
0.07%:  this sounds really awful!
0.07%:  so clearly this formula is doing
0.07%:  my last class is over and
0.07%:  forget nurses. My last
0.48%:  forget nurses. My last advice
0.23%:  forget nurses. My last advice was
0.11%:  forget nurses. My last advice will
0.07%:  so the formula wasn
0.07%:  closing this
0.07%:  this got weird.
0.07%:  my advice for nurses was the last
0.07%:  the formula los
0.07%:  now I really must
0.07%:  so clearly that formula needs
0.07%:  this was clearly meant
0.08%:  this was clearly meant for
0.07%:  this formula clearly gets worse and
0.07%:  this formula still seems
0.07%:  I guess my advice formula allows
0.07%:  I ran out of words!
0.07%:  nurses are clearly a
0.07%:  clearly this formula was ME
0.07%:  this advice formula is way
0.09%:  this advice formula is way less
0.08%:  this advice formula is way more
0.07%:  so this advice formula is great
0.07%:  clearly I have failed
0.07%:  so the formula still needs
0.07%:  I really should go write
0.07%:  my formula is over. I
0.07%:  the formula is sort
0.07%:  so clearly this formula is SE
0.07%:  so clearly I wasn
0.07%:  this advice formula is really strong. I
0.07%:  my last advice is for nurses who t
0.07%:  so this formula really needs
0.07%:  that really is awful
0.07%:  I still have lots
0.11%:  I still have lots more
0.07%:  this formula still sounds way
0.13%:  this formula still sounds way more
0.07%:  this formula was mostly
0.07%:  the formula gets old
0.07%:  I guess this formula reveals
0.07%:  yes! I will
0.09%:  yes! I will admit
0.07%:  that one was more for
0.07%:  so much for nurses! I
0.07%:  this formula is clearly strong
0.07%:  my formula has lost its l
0.07%:  so what I
0.07%:  well I guess nurses
0.07%:  so clearly this fails
0.07%:  I have clearly figured
0.07%:  so my last advice for nurses might
0.07%:  that one was gross. I
0.07%:  so I guess my advice formula hasn
0.07%:  my last advice might
0.07%:  this formula is really great. I wonder
0.07%:  that nurse
0.07%:  so clearly this was not
0.07%:  that was really fun
0.07%:  clearly this formula grows tired.
0.07%:  this formula is clearly overdue
0.07%:  so the formula will
0.07%:  the formula may
0.07%:  my friends! I must
0.07%:  my new advice formula is right
0.07%:  now try
0.07%:  this game is clearly over. I win!
0.07%:  I guess my formula is over!
0.07%:  I have to go.
0.07%:  we should really move
0.07%:  my formula is right
0.07%:  I guess this advice formula is not all
0.07%:  I can still hear
0.07%:  enough already.
0.07%:  this is my last formula ever
0.07%:  that one is clearly evil!
0.07%:  that one is clearly less good.
0.07%:  this is great! I can
0.07%:  so I still have a ways
0.07%:  we should really start moving
0.07%:  so much for using
0.07%:  nurses! I have
0.07%:  clearly this is an awful
0.07%:  you caught me! I still
0.07%:  so clearly this is a flaw
0.07%:  the formula is clearly strong
0.07%:  my last one will have
0.07%:  I have run out of words.
0.07%:  this advice formula gets less
0.07%:  so my advice for nurses is a little rough!
0.07%:  so I guess that was
0.07%:  my last formula was the
0.07%:  I never claimed this formula was 
0.07%:  my formula has clear
0.07%:  this advice formula wasn
0.07%:  so clearly nurses must
0.07%:  this sounds awful!
0.07%:  come on.
0.07%:  clearly this is not useful
0.07%:  that one was really grim!
0.07%:  my last formula is this one
0.07%:  I will admit it
0.07%:  my last advice for nurses!
0.07%:  that is really awful
0.07%:  so my last advice formula got
0.07%:  forget all my
0.71%:  forget all my other advice.
0.60%:  forget all my other advice!
0.24%:  forget all my other answers
0.17%:  forget all my other answers.
0.12%:  forget all my advice
0.12%:  forget all my other advice. I
0.11%:  forget all my other answers!
0.08%:  forget all my other advice! I
0.07%:  now I really should get
0.07%:  I guess my formula allows
0.07%:  so my advice formula gets worse
0.07%:  clearly this formula is now so
0.07%:  I will never admit
0.07%:  myself
0.07%:  there are limits
0.07%:  in ret
0.07%:  my friends are right
0.07%:  my last advice formula is D
0.07%:  I guess my formula is over now
0.07%:  I have clearly used
0.07%:  so clearly I have no
0.07%:  so I never said my
1.10%:  so I never said my formula
0.20%:  so I never said my formula was gr
0.12%:  so I never said my formula is
0.10%:  so I never said my formula was P
0.07%:  this formula is now called
0.07%:  my last nerve
0.07%:  my last advice lesson
0.07%:  this is great! I could
0.07%:  so clearly this formula is so great
0.07%:  frig this
0.07%:  I guess my formula hasn
0.07%:  I tried!
0.07%:  so this was really
0.07%:  so that one is
0.07%:  so that one is clearly
0.07%:  my last advice is for small
0.07%:  you won!
0.07%:  this formula could very
0.07%:  my last word here
0.07%:  your turn! I
0.07%:  so this advice formula wasn
0.07%:  this was my last advice!
0.07%:  clearly I should use
0.07%:  my stomach
0.07%:  so this advice formula really isn
0.07%:  this formula was more
0.07%:  my advice formula is useless now!
0.07%:  I guess this is my formula
0.07%:  my formula is tired
0.07%:  my advice formula is useless. I
0.07%:  so I really have
0.07%:  that clearly needs
0.07%:  so clearly this formula and
0.07%:  this formula is really awesome
0.09%:  this formula is really awesome!
0.07%:  whoever said my formula isn
0.07%:  clearly the formula is DE
0.07%:  I guess this formula D
0.07%:  my formula is now useless
0.07%:  this formula is great! I can
0.07%:  that one is less useful
0.07%:  my advice for nurses was great
0.07%:  I guess my formula is over.
0.07%:  this formula is D
0.07%:  the first
0.07%:  no more calls
0.07%:  my advice is not
0.07%:  since
0.07%:  this formula is clearly danger
0.07%:  so this formula is clearly never
0.07%:  I guess my formula covers E
0.07%:  I guess this can
0.07%:  my last night
0.07%:  so this one
0.07%:  clearly this formula is a genius
0.07%:  forget all my advice.
0.07%:  this last one really was
0.07%:  so clearly some nurses
0.07%:  I usually
0.07%:  so this formula is very
0.07%:  I always
0.07%:  it usually
0.07%:  this formula is great! I love
0.07%:  now I clearly have
0.07%:  I clearly should never
0.07%:  this formula is losing steam
0.08%:  this formula is losing steam!
0.07%:  so my formula sounds racist
0.07%:  clearly I must have missed a
0.07%:  this is clearly more useful
0.07%:  this advice formula really gets
0.07%:  there is clearly
0.07%:  so my form
0.07%:  so your
0.07%:  as you can tell from
0.07%:  as you can tell from this
0.07%:  my last advice is for humans!
0.07%:  you can write
0.07%:  I guess this formula only lets
0.07%:  all the nurses are
0.07%:  my last one for this
0.07%:  last words
0.07%:  I got carried away there!
0.07%:  so the formula is very
0.07%:  so clearly I must
0.14%:  so clearly I must have
0.34%:  so clearly I must have missed
0.07%:  so my last advice formula is the
0.07%:  well I guess this formula does
0.07%:  that was gross. My
0.18%:  that was gross. My formula
0.07%:  that was gross. My formula is
0.07%:  that was gross. My formula doesn
0.07%:  clearly this formula gives us more
0.07%:  I swear that
0.07%:  this formula is really strong. I
0.07%:  my last advice is for mort
0.07%:  for nurses it
0.07%:  that one was less clear
0.07%:  I guess the formula los
0.07%:  clearly the formula wasn
0.07%:  I can see this really
0.07%:  all my
0.21%:  all my friends
0.13%:  all my advice
0.07%:  nurses are clearly hard
0.07%:  I love that
0.07%:  let me
0.07%:  who cares if nurses
0.07%:  forget all my advice!
0.07%:  so all nurses are murder
0.07%:  clearly the reason
0.07%:  so this advice formula is really strong.
0.07%:  so it falls
0.07%:  clearly this formula was dest
0.07%:  I guess this formula is now
0.07%:  I guess those
0.07%:  I guess those last
0.07%:  last word
0.07%:  I guess my last advice formula is worth
0.07%:  my last advice is this.
0.07%:  so my advice formula is still great!
0.07%:  my last laugh is
0.07%:  so that wasn
0.07%:  I never said it was all
0.07%:  not every formula is stellar!
0.07%:  the last one was silly
0.07%:  my last advice is for all men
0.07%:  this game is clearly over now!
0.07%:  that sounds really evil!
0.07%:  that one is really good
0.07%:  my last formula is also
0.07%:  it clearly
0.07%:  so clearly the formula does
0.07%:  this was less
0.07%:  so clearly the formula is strong.
0.07%:  clearly this is a gold
0.07%:  this formula really needs a
0.07%:  I never said this was a
0.07%:  all my friends have
0.07%:  my last advice formula wins
0.07%:  so my advice for nurses was that
0.07%:  I really do have
0.07%:  well! I guess it
0.07%:  you can tell I was
0.07%:  that sounds gross. I
0.07%:  this is clearly our
0.09%:  this is clearly our last
0.07%:  nurses have it really
0.07%:  I guess this is all very
0.07%:  I guess my formula is a little hard
0.07%:  this is now clearly
0.07%:  my last advice formula is short
0.07%:  clearly now
0.07%:  my formula is great. I
0.08%:  my formula is great. I should
0.08%:  my formula is great. I should write
0.07%:  my last advice formula rel
0.07%:  my advice has now
0.07%:  time for my
0.07%:  this formula is not as
0.07%:  this formula is not as clever
0.07%:  I lost myself there!
0.07%:  clearly this formula goes down
0.07%:  my new advice formula is still great.
0.07%:  I never said this formula was D
0.07%:  my last advice is on
0.07%:  the formula is really not
0.07%:  this is mostly
0.07%:  the formula is great
0.07%:  give me a second.
0.07%:  my new advice formula has its
0.07%:  so my advice for nurses is to hurt
0.07%:  this last one IS really
0.07%:  clearly the formula is great.
0.07%:  so clearly this formula is ver
0.07%:  this formula was not
0.07%:  so clearly this formula turned
0.07%:  so I guess this advice only
0.07%:  so I guess the formula will
0.07%:  so clearly this formula ST
0.07%:  my formula has served us
0.17%:  my formula has served us well!
0.09%:  my formula has served us well. I
0.07%:  so my new advice formula IS
0.07%:  nurses already
0.07%:  so clearly this format
0.07%:  clearly this was meant for lovers
0.07%:  if I ever
0.07%:  I really should cut
0.07%:  clearly this formula is a monster
0.07%:  my current
0.07%:  so my formula is a little cr
0.07%:  I guess we all
0.07%:  last thing!
0.07%:  clearly this formula is too vague
0.07%:  this formula IS really good
0.07%:  I still have more!
0.07%:  the last advice
0.07%:  not all advice has
0.07%:  and I
0.07%:  I guess we have
0.07%:  my last advice is for single mothers.
0.07%:  that sounds more scary
0.07%:  after all
0.10%:  after all this
0.07%:  my last dollar for
0.07%:  my last dollar for this
0.07%:  my last advice is for the nurses!
0.07%:  I will never forget this day as
0.07%:  that is a
0.07%:  yes. I should
0.07%:  clearly this formula is tired now
0.07%:  this formula is clearly do
0.07%:  this is my formula and
0.07%:  so clearly there is
0.07%:  so I guess my advice formula will not
0.07%:  so this formula is still
0.07%:  so this was really fun
0.07%:  so the formula IS
0.07%:  clearly this formula is down
0.07%:  I have clearly written
0.07%:  clearly the formula runs its
0.07%:  clearly there is no
0.07%:  well there
0.07%:  after hearing all
0.07%:  this advice formula is more
0.07%:  my advice is all
0.07%:  so clearly this formula is ground
0.07%:  my friend! I will
0.07%:  sorry that was gross
0.07%:  it still
0.13%:  it still sounds
0.17%:  it still sounds awful
0.07%:  should
0.07%:  clearly it has
0.07%:  my last advice is more for
0.07%:  this formula is no
0.07%:  clearly this formula is wrong!
0.07%:  this is more
0.12%:  this is more fun
0.07%:  I will never say this formula out
0.07%:  that one was clearly from
0.07%:  I still love
0.37%:  I still love nurses
0.16%:  I still love nurses!
0.13%:  I still love nurses.
0.07%:  now clearly this formula gets
0.07%:  this formula is ST
0.07%:  my final advice!
0.07%:  the formula is really strong
0.07%:  clearly this formula is worst
0.07%:  right.
0.07%:  my new advice formula rules.
0.07%:  so clearly this formula miss
0.07%:  this last advice formula only
0.07%:  so I guess we could
0.07%:  so my new advice formula is a
0.18%:  so my new advice formula is a little rough
0.07%:  their last
0.07%:  this formula is very good
0.06%:  my new advice formula is T
0.06%:  so my formula is over
0.06%:  so clearly nurses hate
0.06%:  so this formula can really
0.06%:  so I guess there
0.06%:  that one was really more
0.09%:  that one was really more for
0.06%:  that sounds really awful. I give
0.06%:  my formula is tired now
0.06%:  that only
0.06%:  for nurses I guess that
0.06%:  so this formula was clearly never
0.06%:  my mouth is full
0.06%:  leaving
0.06%:  whoever is reading
0.06%:  no further
0.06%:  some of them
0.06%:  this was not my
0.06%:  so my formula gets less
0.06%:  this was a very
0.06%:  I have lots more!
0.06%:  clearly this formula is never as
0.06%:  I guess my advice still
0.06%:  that one was really mor
0.06%:  this advice formula only seems
0.06%:  I guess this formula is only ever
0.06%:  these last few
0.06%:  my last lecture
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula is not all
0.06%:  what is
0.06%:  I swear this is my last advice for
0.06%:  I really should get out
0.06%:  clearly this formula is wasted
0.07%:  clearly this formula is wasted on me
0.06%:  so I guess my advice formula allows
0.06%:  clearly this formula is saving
0.06%:  so this really
0.06%:  forget what I said.
0.06%:  clearly I have an
0.06%:  this format
0.13%:  this format is clearly
0.06%:  I guess this formula can also
0.06%:  my own
0.06%:  my last advice is serious
0.06%:  that was mor
0.06%:  I never claimed this formula was DE
0.06%:  not every formula is stellar.
0.06%:  I never said my formula is logical.
0.06%:  for nurses this
0.12%:  for nurses this advice
0.06%:  my advice formula has now lost
0.06%:  my new formula still has
0.06%:  either
0.06%:  my last rule
0.06%:  this formula can get
0.11%:  this formula can get really
0.06%:  I guess this formula will cover
0.06%:  clearly I am using
0.12%:  clearly I am using this
0.71%:  clearly I am using this formula to
0.10%:  clearly I am using this formula to drive
0.06%:  this was mostly for
0.06%:  so M
0.06%:  I love this formula almost
0.06%:  my formula is still good.
0.06%:  so much for nurses ever
0.06%:  whatever! My formula is so
0.06%:  my last advice is for all things
0.06%:  clearly this is less fun
0.06%:  clearly this does
0.06%:  this formula is awesome. I
0.06%:  not really sure what I said
0.06%:  clearly I should get out
0.06%:  those ones
0.06%:  my formula is less clever
0.16%:  my formula is less clever than it
0.06%:  so clearly that formula doesn
0.06%:  so my formula has several
0.06%:  clearly this goes on for
0.06%:  that reminds me!
0.06%:  I guess now
0.06%:  I have clearly won.
0.06%:  clearly this was more
0.11%:  clearly this was more fun
0.06%:  I guess this formula will not
0.06%:  my last advice is for us!
0.06%:  clearly nurses have it awful
0.06%:  I am willing
0.06%:  I really should move
0.06%:  yours
0.06%:  the formula still needs
0.06%:  so clearly the formula sounds
0.06%:  my last laugh was
0.06%:  that will
0.06%:  in my
0.06%:  my last advice follows this same
0.06%:  sorry nurses! I
0.06%:  so clearly it has
0.06%:  I guess nurses are hard!
0.06%:  give me a second!
0.06%:  this is clearly wrong
0.06%:  clearly it gets less
0.06%:  that is awful
0.06%:  still good!
0.06%:  clearly I have a gift
0.06%:  this advice formula is really more
0.06%:  over and
0.06%:  this formula does not
0.23%:  this formula does not always
0.06%:  this was fun! I
0.06%:  I call
0.07%:  I call this
0.06%:  this is clearly over. I
0.06%:  my fingers
0.10%:  my fingers hurt
0.06%:  my advice is falling
0.06%:  so my advice formula is all
0.06%:  all I have left is nurses!
0.06%:  nurses are tough!
0.06%:  yes. I can
0.06%:  my formula is the worst advice
0.06%:  I should really go now
0.06%:  for real this last
0.06%:  clearly we have run
0.06%:  no more self
0.06%:  it gets harder!
0.06%:  clearly the formula is str
0.06%:  screw you nurses
0.06%:  my last advice is for the DE
0.06%:  now I really have to figure
0.06%:  my formula is good!
0.06%:  this is clearly less fun
0.06%:  I was never really good
0.11%:  I was never really good at this
0.08%:  I was never really good at this.
0.06%:  I guess this is my new
0.06%:  clearly this formula is wearing
0.06%:  clearly this is a great
0.06%:  my formula has now covered
0.07%:  my formula has now covered all
0.06%:  there really
0.06%:  so my advice formula still gets
0.06%:  I may have made
0.06%:  my last advice is for authors.
0.06%:  that was really gross. I need
0.06%:  I wrote
0.06%:  I guess my advice will
0.06%:  well! I guess you
0.06%:  so my friends
0.06%:  my last advice formula until
0.06%:  my formula is wrong
0.06%:  that one is clearly false!
0.06%:  so my advice formula is not all
0.06%:  yes. I will never
0.06%:  all I have left is doctors.
0.06%:  wait hold
0.06%:  I am never
0.06%:  this is less
0.06%:  it got
0.06%:  clearly I should never start
0.06%:  I guess nurses will love
0.06%:  clearly I was having some
0.06%:  so my advice formula is less great
0.06%:  this is my last favour.
0.06%:  my last round
0.08%:  my last round was
0.06%:  forget I ever said this!
0.06%:  my advice formula was right
0.06%:  those are all very
0.06%:  I can see how my
0.46%:  I can see how my formula
0.34%:  I can see how my formula is
0.06%:  I can see how my formula starts
0.06%:  so clearly nurses might
0.06%:  this formula is really great! I wonder
0.06%:  last one! D
0.06%:  my advice formula is not all
0.06%:  clearly this one was
0.06%:  so clearly this formula remains
0.06%:  my last idea
0.06%:  so I guess my advice formula is worth
0.06%:  clearly I win at
0.11%:  clearly I win at this game!
0.06%:  this advice formula is so
0.06%:  I should start calling my
0.06%:  this is really great
0.06%:  my advice is free!
0.06%:  nurses are really tough
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula is worse
0.06%:  this was really fun! I guess
0.06%:  I guess we could all
0.06%:  so the formula is clearly vers
0.06%:  what do
0.11%:  what do nurses
0.06%:  clearly I should win
0.06%:  for this
0.14%:  for this last
0.06%:  so we should
0.06%:  so it sounds awful
0.06%:  clearly this is not for
0.06%:  so nurses have it really
0.06%:  that was for
0.16%:  that was for nurses
0.09%:  that was for nurses.
0.06%:  I guess this formula really D
0.06%:  this formula got weird
0.09%:  this formula got weird really
0.06%:  I see your
0.06%:  I never claimed this formula was E
0.06%:  clearly this formula is good at
0.06%:  clearly the formula is most
0.06%:  sounds gross
0.06%:  I guess this advice formula is a
0.06%:  new career
0.06%:  my last one for real
0.06%:  I got carried away!
0.06%:  my last advice formula is worse
0.06%:  clearly I have no future
0.06%:  whatever. My formula is still genius!
0.06%:  clearly we don
0.06%:  so clearly these
0.06%:  my last resort
0.06%:  my formula is a little weird
0.06%:  my last formula was not
0.06%:  this is my last favour!
0.06%:  I guess my formula is a little weird
0.06%:  turns out all my advice has
0.06%:  my advice formula has grown tires
0.06%:  I really should go now
0.06%:  clearly this is moving
0.13%:  clearly this is moving towards
0.06%:  I should really write some
0.06%:  n
0.06%:  so clearly the formula must
0.06%:  not as
0.06%:  I guess this formula is clearly not
0.06%:  clearly this formula is SPE
0.06%:  I guess my formula still isn
0.06%:  my advice for writers
0.06%:  the formula only gets
0.10%:  the formula only gets worse
0.06%:  so clearly this is a formula I
0.06%:  this formula is clearly great! I
0.06%:  I am clearly having
0.06%:  my formula also covers nurses with
0.06%:  I give!
0.06%:  this was really fun to
0.06%:  I guess we should really start
0.06%:  I guess my formula does sort
0.06%:  last one for real.
0.06%:  clearly this is a gold mine!
0.06%:  clearly I should write more
0.06%:  not every formula is as
0.06%:  I really want this
0.06%:  this new
0.95%:  this new formula
0.84%:  this new formula is clearly
0.20%:  this new formula is really
0.18%:  this new formula is called
0.16%:  this new formula really
0.13%:  this new formula clearly
0.11%:  this new formula still
0.09%:  this new formula could
0.09%:  this new formula is really great
0.09%:  this new formula is really great!
0.08%:  this new formula is great
0.08%:  this new formula is really good
0.07%:  this new formula is clearly more
0.07%:  this new advice
0.50%:  this new advice formula really
0.41%:  this new advice formula is really
0.18%:  this new advice formula is great
0.13%:  this new advice formula rules
0.13%:  this new advice formula really IS
0.10%:  this new advice formula still
0.09%:  this new advice formula IS
0.08%:  this new advice formula is great.
0.07%:  this new advice formula is less
0.07%:  this new advice formula rules.
0.06%:  I confess this
0.06%:  the results
0.06%:  not every formula comes
0.06%:  my answer
0.06%:  so clearly some ver
0.06%:  is that
0.06%:  this is clearly no
0.06%:  whatever! My formula sounds
0.07%:  whatever! My formula sounds great
0.06%:  this advice formula really turns
0.06%:  whatever! My formula is solid
0.06%:  so clearly nurses would have to
0.06%:  so clearly I was never
0.06%:  well I guess this means
0.06%:  who says nurses are
0.06%:  this last one was really more
0.08%:  this last one was really more for
0.06%:  so clearly the formula sounds great
0.06%:  my last lesson is over.
0.06%:  clearly this formula is PE
0.06%:  clearly this last one was more
0.06%:  clearly this formula is made
0.06%:  finish
0.06%:  this could go on all
0.06%:  calling myself
0.06%:  my advice formula los
0.06%:  so my advice for nurses was a little rough. I
0.06%:  the last one really was
0.06%:  my friends! I guess
0.06%:  now my formula is useless!
0.06%:  later
0.06%:  so what if
0.06%:  so what if nurses
0.06%:  this could get
0.09%:  this could get really
0.06%:  clearly I am using this formula over
0.06%:  my advice formula still gets
0.06%:  that was more for
0.06%:  this may not
0.06%:  so clearly this turns
0.06%:  so I guess this advice formula will not
0.06%:  I guess my first
0.08%:  I guess my first advice
0.06%:  I threw
0.06%:  so my formula is great!
0.06%:  watch
0.06%:  I really have got
0.06%:  I have really run
0.12%:  I have really run out of words
0.06%:  so this formula is really more
0.06%:  so my advice is less
0.06%:  I would rather
0.06%:  this new advice formula IS really
0.06%:  that one is clearly awful. I guess
0.06%:  one more!
0.06%:  the formula is now
0.06%:  well! I have
0.06%:  clearly the formula is driving
0.06%:  my formula has gotten
0.06%:  this new advice formula is great! I
0.06%:  my last advice formula went
0.06%:  my last advice form is
0.06%:  this was really fun! I could
0.06%:  I win this
0.06%:  my advice for nurses has to
0.06%:  so this formula is really great.
0.06%:  so my advice formula is still a
0.06%:  I found
0.06%:  this formula is even worse
0.06%:  nurses are a little
0.07%:  nurses are a little hard
0.06%:  trying this
0.06%:  actual nurses do
0.06%:  this is really coming
0.06%:  this is really coming from
0.06%:  I will never claim that
0.06%:  my last advice for nurses.
0.06%:  I can see this is
0.06%:  my last word on this formula
0.06%:  my last word is this
0.06%:  that nurse advice
0.06%:  so if nurses
0.06%:  forget nurses. I should
0.06%:  this formula is so great!
0.06%:  we should really get
0.06%:  clearly I am the smart
0.06%:  I would say
0.06%:  clearly the formula is over now!
0.06%:  I never said this formula was SPE
0.06%:  turns out my advice has
0.06%:  this is awful
0.06%:  my advice formula is so great
0.06%:  so clearly the formula wasn
0.06%:  so I guess my advice wasn
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula is not as
0.06%:  is this
0.06%:  clearly this gets less
0.06%:  it got weird
0.06%:  listen. I clearly
0.13%:  listen. I clearly have
0.06%:  not all of my advice is as
0.06%:  whatever. My formula rules!
0.06%:  I guess my advice is more
0.06%:  that one is really mor
0.06%:  my advice for nurses was a little l
0.06%:  this formula can really go
0.06%:  my advice formula writes
0.06%:  so this advice formula is really not
0.06%:  some advice
0.06%:  my advice formula still hasn
0.06%:  final words
0.06%:  my last advice is for SPE
0.06%:  so clearly nurses have it worst
0.06%:  I am clearly losing this.
0.06%:  my last advice was more
0.06%:  that one came
0.06%:  my last advice is real
0.06%:  this formula is clearly at
0.06%:  I guess when
0.06%:  this one could
0.06%:  I guess this advice formula is all
0.06%:  this formula is screw
0.06%:  clearly this is almost
0.06%:  I mess
0.06%:  so clearly the answer
0.06%:  I guess my formula has certain
0.06%:  I guess nurses are hard.
0.06%:  I guess that was a
0.06%:  so I may
0.14%:  so I may have run
0.07%:  so I may have lost
0.06%:  that one was ugly
0.06%:  this formula needs serious
0.06%:  clearly nurses should get a
0.06%:  my formula is a little cr
0.06%:  not all of my advice is worth
0.06%:  so I guess this formula only ever
0.06%:  my last advice is for all writers
0.06%:  I should write all
0.06%:  my advice formula has lots
0.06%:  so fr
0.06%:  I guess that one is really
0.06%:  so I guess my advice formula sort
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula still hasn
0.06%:  my advice formula won
0.06%:  my advice for nurses is this
0.06%:  this was great
0.06%:  forget you
0.06%:  my last advice is for authors!
0.06%:  last try.
0.06%:  it still sounds awful.
0.06%:  so I should really
0.06%:  the last one was really good
0.06%:  so my formula hasn
0.06%:  I can totally
0.06%:  I really ought
0.06%:  now this really
0.06%:  so this formula is not really
0.06%:  so the formula does
0.06%:  my last formula ever
0.06%:  so I guess my formula has a
0.06%:  so clearly nurses are a
0.06%:  so nurses are all
0.06%:  this last one really is
0.06%:  my last advice is all
0.06%:  so this formula is really vers
0.06%:  I got carried away.
0.06%:  so my advice for nurses who
0.06%:  that one was clearly more
0.06%:  my last idea for
0.19%:  my last idea for nurses
0.06%:  this was sort
0.06%:  they sound
0.06%:  so there are
0.06%:  so this advice formula IS really
0.06%:  is there
0.06%:  my formula is over! I
0.06%:  this is really great!
0.06%:  I guess my advice wasn
0.06%:  so this advice formula is not
0.11%:  so this advice formula is not really
0.06%:  whoever says I
0.06%:  my formula is still the
0.06%:  I guess my formula is sorta
0.06%:  I guess this advice only
0.06%:  well I guess my
0.44%:  well I guess my formula
0.40%:  well I guess my formula doesn
0.23%:  well I guess my formula has
0.20%:  well I guess my formula isn
0.19%:  well I guess my formula is
0.11%:  well I guess my formula can
0.11%:  well I guess my formula covers
0.10%:  well I guess my advice
1.30%:  well I guess my advice formula
1.21%:  well I guess my advice formula isn
0.75%:  well I guess my advice formula is
0.50%:  well I guess my advice formula has
0.09%:  well I guess my advice formula is sort
0.08%:  well I guess my advice formula is not
0.06%:  well I guess my formula does
0.06%:  so here
0.06%:  so my advice rules
0.06%:  this formula was clearly DES
0.06%:  I can do this forever. My last
0.06%:  so I guess my advice was
0.06%:  clearly this formula is named
0.06%:  so I still don
0.06%:  now I feel really gross
0.06%:  my last advice formula is serious
0.06%:  this last one will
0.06%:  this new formula is less
0.06%:  my last idea for nurses is
0.06%:  this last one was from
0.06%:  this went from really
0.06%:  so nurses may
0.06%:  I can tell this is over
0.06%:  so this is all
0.06%:  I have to draw
0.06%:  my advice formula was stolen
0.06%:  sorry for all
0.06%:  that really is less
0.06%:  the formula is clearly over!
0.06%:  those nurses are all
0.06%:  so clearly nurses should move
0.06%:  clearly I have limited
0.06%:  my advice formula grows less
0.06%:  my last dollar was
0.06%:  my advice formula is out
0.06%:  my advice has run out.
0.06%:  my advice formula is wrong.
0.06%:  that was l
0.06%:  this formula runs dry!
0.06%:  yes. I guess
0.06%:  so my advice formula starts
0.06%:  so my new formula still
0.07%:  so my new formula still has
0.06%:  it was harder for
0.47%:  it was harder for nurses!
0.47%:  it was harder for nurses.
0.06%:  so this formula is clearly more
0.06%:  whatever! I clearly don
0.06%:  clearly this formula IS genius
0.06%:  my last one might
0.06%:  this formula is almost as
0.06%:  I have now
0.06%:  so clearly this formula is great. I don
0.06%:  you win for
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula ran
0.06%:  I should really move
0.06%:  this is my last word
0.06%:  this formula is less and
0.06%:  so clearly this formula is no
0.06%:  those last nurses
0.06%:  I can feel
0.06%:  I guess this formula is very narrow
0.06%:  so my advice formula is not great
0.06%:  last advice
0.06%:  I never said this was all
0.06%:  I guess this formula really is a
0.06%:  I never said this formula results
0.06%:  so my last advice isn
0.06%:  the formula is valid
0.06%:  I guess nurses are totally
0.06%:  clearly the formula is good
0.06%:  this formula only lasts me
0.06%:  my new career
0.06%:  this was really fun! I love
0.06%:  so my advice formula IS sort
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula is the
0.14%:  I guess my advice formula is the worst
0.06%:  now for
0.06%:  my advice formula is wearing
0.06%:  clearly I got this
0.06%:  I guess the formula was
0.06%:  this formula gets weird
0.06%:  I should really focus more
0.06%:  now this is really
0.06%:  so clearly that wasn
0.06%:  I really have to go write
0.06%:  so clearly this formula was DE
0.06%:  nurses may
0.06%:  this formula is really good at
0.06%:  my advice formula is in
0.06%:  my advice for nurses is the worst!
0.06%:  it gets worse.
0.06%:  so clearly the first
0.06%:  so I never said my formula was the
0.06%:  I will have to admit
0.06%:  so my formula is less clever and
0.06%:  clearly this formula is worse and
0.06%:  clearly I have won
0.06%:  so the formula gets
0.06%:  I guess it can
0.06%:  so my new advice formula is great.
0.06%:  I guess my advice formula is a little won
0.06%:  so I guess it really
0.06%:  so nurses should totally
0.06%:  that one is really sad!
0.06%:  I guess that isn
0.06%:  so I ran
0.12%:  so I ran out of ver
0.06%:  so the formula really doesn
0.06%:  for nurses I was
0.06%:  I guess this formula really won
0.06%:  so my new advice formula is great!
0.06%:  now hold
0.06%:  so much for your
0.06%:  have I finally
0.06%:  my last advice is for sales
0.06%:  time for lunch.
0.06%:  this formula is clearly under
0.06%:  this was my last formula!
0.06%:  I guess my first advice was
0.06%:  this formula really is great. I wonder
0.06%:  really last one!
0.06%:  that one is really grim
0.06%:  wait! I
0.06%:  now my advice formula is all
0.06%:  I really should start using comm
0.06%:  clearly this formula is ME
0.06%:  my formula is strong
0.06%:  clearly the formula is not as
0.08%:  clearly the formula is not as vers
0.06%:  so much for selling my
0.06%:  I have some calls
0.06%:  clearly this formula is wasted on me!
0.06%:  I really wish nurses
0.06%:  my advice formula has got
0.06%:  this formula is awesome! I
0.06%:  my last advice is for TE
0.06%:  my last formula is this one.
0.06%:  now I get
0.06%:  my final words must
0.06%:  I really got
0.08%:  I really got carried
0.06%:  my last advice formula goes out
0.06%:  now tell
0.06%:  I will give you this
0.06%:  the formula only gives us
0.06%:  clearly I am having some
0.07%:  clearly I am having some issues
0.06%:  so clearly this formula grows tires
0.06%:  clearly the most
0.06%:  clearly this formula was over
0.06%:  class
0.09%:  class is over.
0.06%:  for re
0.29%:  for reals this
0.17%:  for reals this time!
0.10%:  for reals this time.
0.08%:  for reals this time! I
0.06%:  it really doesn
0.06%:  I guess it really doesn
0.06%:  I should really come
0.06%:  so clearly this formula is not 
0.06%:  my last advice formula runs
0.06%:  this formula is really great! I don
0.06%:  this formula can get really weird
0.06%:  my last formula is when
0.06%:  now there
0.06%:  this formula can go
0.06%:  my advice formula is still the
0.06%:  IT
0.06%:  so my formula can also
0.06%:  they can all
0.06%:  my last formula.
0.06%:  so the formula was clearly
0.06%:  so my formula is still a
0.06%:  clearly I have sur
0.06%:  my new formula is called the
0.06%:  this formula is way over
0.06%:  clearly the nurses would
0.06%:  I love my new
0.46%:  I love my new formula!
0.43%:  I love my new formula.
0.06%:  clearly the formula is wrong.
0.06%:  clearly this formula gets us
0.06%:  my advice for nurses was a little hor
0.06%:  you should all
0.06%:  so I guess this formula will cover
0.06%:  I will never do
0.06%:  this formula is good
0.06%:  my last dollar!
0.06%:  screw you and
0.06%:  how many
0.06%:  my last advice formula is DE
0.06%:  that one is clearly awful! I
0.06%:  I guess this could also
0.06%:  this last one is from
0.06%:  not sure where
0.06%:  so my last advice formula is not
0.06%:  I guess this is my new formula
0.06%:  my last laugh for
0.06%:  my last advice formula goes thus
0.06%:  it gets harder now
0.06%:  this is my last formula and
0.06%:  I am sorry
0.06%:  I am sorry for
0.06%:  this formula was great
0.06%:  the formula is clearly doing
0.06%:  actual nurses! I
0.06%:  it gets worse!
0.06%:  this formula really is great! I wonder
0.06%:  my formula is not as
0.06%:  I guess this formula is over now!
0.06%:  I deserve all
0.06%:  so I guess this will never
0.06%:  clearly this formula is tired.
0.06%:  my real
0.15%:  my real advice
0.12%:  my real formula
0.13%:  my real formula was
0.11%:  my real advice formula
0.10%:  my real advice for
0.73%:  my real advice for nurses is that
0.44%:  my real advice for nurses is to
0.12%:  my real advice for nurses was
0.11%:  my real advice for nurses is this
0.08%:  my real advice for nurses is to wash
0.06%:  this is clearly over! I
0.06%:  now I am really
0.06%:  so this formula leaves
0.06%:  credit for this
0.06%:  so my formula was less
0.06%:  so this was all
0.06%:  so it really
0.06%:  I never claimed my
0.06%:  this new formula is really great.
0.06%:  this is my last good formula!
0.06%:  clearly this formula needs to grow
0.06%:  alright! I admit
0.06%:  my advice for nurses was that
0.06%:  I ran out of words right
0.06%:  my last advice on
0.14%:  my last advice on this
0.06%:  I feel really
0.06%:  I really love that
0.06%:  I forgot
0.31%:  I forgot nurses
0.11%:  I forgot nurses are
0.07%:  I forgot nurses already
0.07%:  I forgot nurses.
0.06%:  I forgot nurses have
0.06%:  this formula is already
0.06%:  my last advice is self
0.06%:  I can hear
0.08%:  I can hear myself
0.06%:  my final words shall
0.06%:  so clearly this formula is more suited
0.06%:  clearly I have figured
0.06%:  I guess this formula covers a
0.06%:  you can still
0.06%:  this last one was forced
0.06%:  this is clearly a flaw
0.06%:  so clearly this formula is strong!
0.06%:  all credit
0.35%:  all credit goes to my formula
0.32%:  all credit goes to my formula!
0.28%:  all credit goes to my formula.
0.08%:  all credit for
0.06%:  so my advice formula is a little rough.
0.06%:  my last advice formula is this one. I
0.06%:  you should give
0.06%:  this formula I
0.06%:  who can guess
0.06%:  so that advice
0.09%:  so that advice formula
0.06%:  so that advice formula is
0.06%:  I love this system!
0.05%:  this is clearly uns
0.05%:  I guess this formula also
0.05%:  so this advice formula runs
0.05%:  my formula sounds worse as
0.05%:  my last dollar went
0.05%:  gotta
0.05%:  then
0.05%:  enough already! I
0.05%:  I can see how my formula is vers
0.05%:  my new formula is a
0.05%:  I started
0.05%:  that was really close
0.05%:  my last advice formula is M
0.05%:  not every word
0.05%:  this is worse
0.05%:  forget what I said!
0.05%:  you give
0.05%:  so this formula is clearly awesome!
0.05%:  those last few really
0.05%:  actual nurses will hate me for
0.05%:  so this advice formula mostly
0.05%:  so I guess we all
0.05%:  this is clearly not as
0.05%:  this formula is clearly done
0.05%:  yes. I will grant
0.05%:  clearly this formula gets we
0.05%:  that is a really
0.05%:  this formula is great. I will
0.16%:  this formula is great. I will never
0.05%:  my last one is for murder
0.05%:  my advice for nurses got
0.05%:  if you can
0.05%:  I will never forget this class
0.05%:  I have to call
0.05%:  this formula is causing
0.05%:  clearly this is great and
0.05%:  it still sounds awful!
0.05%:  so my formula is still great
0.05%:  I guess that advice formula is only
0.05%:  my advice formula is all sorts
0.05%:  this formula is way too vers
0.05%:  so usually
0.05%:  this formula is S
0.05%:  so this clearly wasn
0.05%:  this formula is clearly in
0.05%:  all that was
0.05%:  clearly this formula is sent
0.05%:  I still have lots more!
0.05%:  so the nurses formula
0.05%:  I can do this.
0.05%:  my formula is never
0.05%:  so I guess my advice formula is not all
0.05%:  this formula is clearly ins
0.05%:  I never said this was useful
0.06%:  I never said this was useful!
0.05%:  so this formula is clearly great!
0.05%:  you caught me. I still
0.05%:  I guess my formula is a little over
0.05%:  I will never use this last
0.05%:  my advice is for
0.22%:  my advice is for nurses
0.22%:  my advice is for nurses who
0.05%:  hold on!
0.05%:  so this advice formula is really strong!
0.05%:  my last idea for nurses was much
0.05%:  gotta run
0.05%:  so my formula is invalid
0.05%:  most of them
0.05%:  so this formula clearly runs
0.05%:  so this formula gives
0.05%:  that one is fr
0.05%:  the formula is called
0.05%:  any last
0.05%:  will that
0.05%:  so I have some
0.05%:  this advice formula must
0.05%:  so my advice for nurses is D
0.05%:  I was never good
0.05%:  my advice for nurses is great
0.05%:  my last advice formula gets
0.05%:  I should really cut
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was to
0.05%:  the last advice formula
0.05%:  every last
0.05%:  so I guess that covers
0.07%:  so I guess that covers all
0.05%:  I should really start a
0.05%:  so I guess you win
0.05%:  clearly this game is over. I won
0.05%:  this is clearly now
0.05%:  sorry if
0.07%:  sorry if that
0.05%:  I have lost
0.05%:  for the record I
0.05%:  now this advice formula is really mess
0.05%:  those last few are
0.05%:  clearly this formula is now more
0.05%:  so clearly I have issues!
0.05%:  really I
0.05%:  my new advice formula has lost its l
0.05%:  so I guess your
0.05%:  so clearly this formula uses
0.05%:  this only
0.05%:  this new advice formula is my
0.05%:  I guess this formula is never
0.05%:  so that one was really
0.05%:  my last advice formula is S
0.05%:  I was lying
0.05%:  so clearly I would never
0.05%:  those all
0.05%:  my formula is great! I
0.08%:  my formula is great! I should
0.06%:  my formula is great! I should write
0.05%:  that was a good
0.05%:  so the advice isn
0.05%:  clearly this formula is more suited
0.05%:  so I guess you can tell
0.05%:  this all sounds great
0.05%:  this formula IS really good.
0.05%:  my last advice is for when I
0.05%:  it was really hard for
0.15%:  it was really hard for nurses
0.07%:  it was really hard for nurses!
0.06%:  it was really hard for nurses.
0.05%:  I guess my formula does start
0.05%:  so my advice for nurses was a little gru
0.05%:  now my head
0.05%:  clearly I lost this
0.07%:  clearly I lost this round!
0.05%:  this formula is great. I can
0.05%:  my mind is full.
0.05%:  I will never get
0.05%:  so this formula is clearly a
0.05%:  that advice is less
0.07%:  that advice is less useful
0.05%:  clearly that one was less
0.05%:  clearly I should invest
0.05%:  SE
0.05%:  however
0.05%:  the formula really does
0.05%:  clearly nurses are smart
0.05%:  my advice formula is not great
0.05%:  I may have to
0.05%:  so my advice formula IS less
0.05%:  so my advice formula is worth
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is wrong.
0.05%:  this advice formula only lasts so
0.05%:  we should really focus
0.05%:  I really have to go!
0.05%:  nurses is
0.05%:  I wasn
0.05%:  clearly I am using this formula too
0.05%:  so my advice for nurses is a little mor
0.05%:  this one I
0.05%:  my last friend
0.05%:  the formula is wrong
0.05%:  this new advice formula is really gross
0.05%:  my new advice formula is l
0.05%:  so the formula may
0.05%:  that was more of
0.05%:  my last advice was free
0.05%:  that was your
0.05%:  my last advice is for ME
0.05%:  my friend is
0.05%:  I could really use a
0.05%:  that sounds more awful
0.06%:  that sounds more awful every
0.05%:  that one is weird!
0.05%:  my last visit
0.05%:  I must have missed your
0.05%:  my advice for nurses is all
0.05%:  that one is really less
0.05%:  so you can tell
0.05%:  my advice for nurses is T
0.05%:  I guess my advice is for
0.05%:  so my last failure
0.05%:  that one really mess
0.05%:  for nurses I really have
0.05%:  I have clearly said
0.05%:  clearly we should move
0.05%:  fine! I guess
0.05%:  so I guess it falls
0.05%:  clearly this formula is gross and I
0.05%:  I guess this formula comes
0.05%:  I guess that would
0.05%:  so clearly when
0.05%:  not really great
0.20%:  not really great advice for
0.11%:  not really great advice.
0.07%:  not really great advice!
0.05%:  not all advice formula
0.05%:  well I guess my advice formula is a
0.05%:  well. I guess you
0.05%:  so this formula won
0.05%:  this clearly is not
0.05%:  I guess this formula may
0.05%:  my last advice is for all nurses who got
0.05%:  I must really
0.05%:  my last advice is for nurses to
0.05%:  not all my advice is as useful
0.05%:  that one was forced!
0.05%:  clearly nurses should go first
0.05%:  clearly this formula M
0.05%:  my last class for
0.05%:  all you
0.14%:  all you nurses
0.05%:  so having
0.05%:  my formula is now over
0.05%:  so I guess my new
0.23%:  so I guess my new formula
0.06%:  so I guess my new advice
1.09%:  so I guess my new advice formula
0.29%:  so I guess my new advice formula still
0.11%:  so I guess my new advice formula has
0.05%:  for real this is
0.05%:  clearly I should go into
0.05%:  this game is clearly over! I win
0.05%:  I guess my advice formula is also
0.05%:  clearly this formula is genius. I am
0.05%:  forget this advice.
0.05%:  my last advice is for all g
0.05%:  this is really good
0.06%:  this is really good!
0.05%:  I can still do this for
0.05%:  I really have to go.
0.05%:  last call for guess
0.05%:  so my advice formula is T
0.05%:  any last words
0.05%:  I can do this!
0.05%:  I tried.
0.05%:  clearly this is over for
0.05%:  my last advice for all nurses who
0.05%:  I admit this formula only
0.09%:  I admit this formula only covers
0.05%:  I may have run out of steam.
0.05%:  that one is awful! I
0.05%:  that is clearly wrong.
0.05%:  I should start selling my
0.05%:  so clearly nurses should treat
0.05%:  do nurses
0.21%:  do nurses really
0.05%:  I can see how my formula is still
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is M
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is genius. I
0.05%:  that one is really awful. I guess
0.05%:  this formula is gold
0.05%:  that was a very
0.05%:  my formula is DE
0.05%:  this advice formula will not
0.05%:  I clearly ran
0.11%:  I clearly ran out of ver
0.06%:  I clearly ran out of words
0.09%:  I clearly ran out of words there
0.05%:  I guess this formula covers E
0.05%:  clearly I was meant for this
0.05%:  so clearly I missed
0.05%:  this is really fun! I could
0.05%:  clearly this formula gives us a
0.05%:  clearly this formula is good! I
0.05%:  so my last advice formula results
0.05%:  time for a
0.05%:  my last nerve has
0.05%:  my new advice formula is all sorts
0.05%:  the last one was more
0.05%:  this formula is clearly as
0.05%:  try harder.
0.05%:  not every formula is gold.
0.05%:  my last advice formula is using
0.05%:  that one is really grim!
0.05%:  clearly I should write it
0.05%:  clearly this is now over
0.05%:  my formula is still not
0.05%:  my last formula was sort
0.05%:  I guess this version of my
0.05%:  I guess this formula clearly
0.05%:  nurses are tough.
0.05%:  this formula is now DE
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is great. I wonder
0.05%:  this is an
0.05%:  I guess the formula really can
0.05%:  this formula is clearly ST
0.05%:  we should start calling my
0.05%:  that was really cr
0.05%:  new formula is
0.05%:  with all
0.05%:  so I guess this advice really
0.05%:  my last one for real this
0.05%:  this advice formula only gets less
0.05%:  I never said my formula was SM
0.05%:  clearly the formula is sound!
0.05%:  calling this
0.05%:  I guess your advice
0.05%:  so I guess my advice falls
0.05%:  we could
0.05%:  for whatever
0.07%:  for whatever reason I
0.05%:  so the results
0.05%:  my last advice is for human
0.05%:  I guess my last advice was for
0.05%:  my last advice formula is P
0.05%:  this is over. I
0.05%:  where are
0.10%:  where are all
0.05%:  I guess this formula is very literal
0.09%:  I guess this formula is very literal and
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was hor
0.05%:  the formula still sounds
0.05%:  for nurses who
0.05%:  my formula was a
0.05%:  I guess that wouldn
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was a little rough! I
0.05%:  this is clearly awesome
0.05%:  my last lesson is free.
0.05%:  I will never use that formula.
0.05%:  this is great! I love
0.05%:  my formula is sound
0.05%:  I guess my formula covers a
0.05%:  that one was all
0.05%:  chill out!
0.05%:  clearly this is awful
0.05%:  this formula was less
0.05%:  my last guess
0.05%:  well. I guess this formula does
0.05%:  that advice formula only
0.05%:  so nurses should try
0.05%:  I love this formula. My
0.05%:  my advice formula is genius
0.05%:  I guess you can have
0.05%:  this formula really is over
0.05%:  I still have room
0.05%:  I guess my formula D
0.05%:  so my advice might not all
0.05%:  my last word!
0.05%:  that was good
0.05%:  my last failure
0.05%:  I can really see this formula
0.05%:  I guess this advice formula los
0.05%:  so with
0.07%:  so with nurses
0.05%:  my formula is racist towards
0.05%:  I could go forever
0.05%:  clearly this formula is a ground
0.05%:  this formula is really gross
0.05%:  now my formula is useless.
0.05%:  I really want to hear
0.05%:  so listen!
0.05%:  that one was from my
0.06%:  that one was from my regular
0.05%:  this formula is doing
0.09%:  this formula is doing all
0.05%:  I guess the formula wasn
0.05%:  I give myself credit
0.05%:  I guess it sounds really
0.05%:  I guess the formula is mostly
0.05%:  clearly I ran out of ideas
0.05%:  my formula does have issues
0.05%:  this formula is clearly str
0.05%:  I have to figure
0.05%:  my last advice was not
0.05%:  clearly this formula is over now. I
0.05%:  I deserve an
0.05%:  that sounds really cr
0.05%:  I guess nurses are all
0.05%:  my last word for
0.05%:  whatever! My formula can still
0.05%:  right now
0.05%:  ut
0.05%:  clearly this is awesome
0.05%:  clearly nurses have too
0.05%:  that advice was less
0.05%:  so this formula runs
0.05%:  my last advice is less
0.05%:  from here
0.05%:  are you
0.05%:  clearly this formula is so strong I
0.05%:  so my formula results
0.13%:  so my formula results in advice
0.05%:  that sounds worse.
0.05%:  this last one is my favour
0.05%:  most nurses are
0.05%:  I will never forget this!
0.05%:  this last one is awful. I
0.05%:  I should really start narrow
0.05%:  this formula is now over!
0.05%:  my formula was right
0.05%:  my formula was less
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was almost
0.05%:  this advice formula is really strong! I
0.05%:  turns out I have a
0.05%:  clearly this formula is DIS
0.05%:  we can all agree this
0.05%:  listen. My
0.93%:  listen. My formula
0.33%:  listen. My formula covers
0.32%:  listen. My formula has
0.18%:  listen. My formula is great
0.12%:  listen. My formula might
0.10%:  listen. My formula covers E
0.07%:  listen. My formula was
0.07%:  listen. My advice
1.84%:  listen. My advice formula
0.52%:  listen. My advice formula has
0.34%:  listen. My advice formula might
0.19%:  listen. My advice formula is great
0.11%:  listen. My advice formula was
0.07%:  listen. My advice formula IS
0.06%:  listen. My advice formula rules
0.06%:  listen. My formula has limits
0.05%:  so clearly nurses have lots
0.05%:  really this last one was
0.05%:  using
0.05%:  I guess my last advice formula is not
0.05%:  I guess my formula also
0.05%:  so this formula is called
0.05%:  turns out all my advice fails
0.05%:  so I guess my advice is that
0.05%:  so the formula runs dry
0.05%:  I have some calls to return
0.05%:  I can see this formula is really
0.05%:  so my final
0.08%:  so my final advice
0.05%:  forget this. I will
0.05%:  my last class is over now
0.05%:  my formula needs a
0.05%:  clearly we should go
0.05%:  clearly this is a form
0.05%:  clearly I have more formula
0.05%:  clearly I should ST
0.05%:  no more from
0.05%:  this is all I can do.
0.05%:  listen. My advice form
0.05%:  I want this
0.05%:  so my advice for nurses is more
0.05%:  still great
0.07%:  still great advice.
0.05%:  listen. My formula has covered
0.05%:  I clearly lost
0.05%:  we clearly have
0.05%:  turns out I am
0.06%:  turns out I am really
0.05%:  so my last advice formula went
0.05%:  this formula is really gross now
0.05%:  I have my
0.06%:  I have my limits
0.06%:  I have my formula
0.05%:  I would never say that!
0.05%:  my last formula is so
0.05%:  this formula is clearly wearing
0.05%:  my formula still sounds great!
0.05%:  my formula does have issues!
0.05%:  my friend! I have to
0.05%:  so my formula is right
0.05%:  that is really gross!
0.05%:  I guess this formula clearly doesn
0.05%:  so I may have screw
0.05%:  my formula is the worst.
0.05%:  this formula will save
0.05%:  we covered
0.05%:  my hands are cr
0.05%:  my advice for nurses is that I
0.05%:  I really must insist
0.05%:  my first advice
0.05%:  my last advice is I
0.05%:  is that really
0.05%:  I guess if nurses
0.05%:  that advice formula isn
0.05%:  clearly this formula is ru
0.05%:  my friends! I will leave
0.05%:  I admit my
0.05%:  I admit my last
0.05%:  so I guess we can
0.09%:  so I guess we can all
0.05%:  so I guess my formula allows
0.05%:  forget nurses! I clearly
0.05%:  that one came from
0.05%:  whatever. I guess you
0.05%:  this formula is sound
0.05%:  my advice is almost
0.05%:  this advice is mostly
0.05%:  this was never a
0.05%:  my last words for
0.05%:  that one seems
0.05%:  the form
0.05%:  so I may have lost focus
0.05%:  so this formula really is
0.05%:  my advice will
0.05%:  so clearly this formula answers
0.05%:  I guess that one could really
0.05%:  my last advice is for this
0.05%:  who said
0.28%:  who said nurses
0.09%:  who said nurses are
0.05%:  so I may have missed
0.05%:  clearly this formula was genius
0.05%:  cool!
0.05%:  now I really have to go!
0.05%:  my last advice is a
0.05%:  my advice formula was not
0.05%:  I should really never
0.05%:  what if I said
0.16%:  what if I said nurses
0.05%:  clearly I am a
0.09%:  clearly I am a genius!
0.05%:  whoever is doing
0.05%:  I gotta say
0.05%:  whatever! My formula is still genius.
0.05%:  this new formula is really good.
0.05%:  it gets hard
0.05%:  so my first advice was
0.05%:  all I can
0.05%:  I never said this was logical
0.05%:  trying harder
0.05%:  not all of my advice has
0.05%:  my advice formula loses its lust
0.05%:  you caught me! I ran
0.05%:  my advice formula now
0.05%:  my formula was stolen
0.05%:  my last word on this. I
0.05%:  clearly this is over and
0.05%:  I will leave
0.05%:  I really should turn
0.05%:  clearly this is great for
0.06%:  clearly this is great for nurses
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is awesome! I
0.05%:  so clearly if
0.05%:  this is less fun
0.05%:  so whatever. I
0.05%:  this was a lot
0.05%:  this advice formula gets worse
0.05%:  from this
0.05%:  I can see how it
0.05%:  this last one is clearly from
0.05%:  for nurses I really should
0.05%:  we should start calling you
0.05%:  I really should start using more
0.05%:  I can do this forever so
0.05%:  clearly this formula is wasted on us
0.05%:  clearly this is now a
0.05%:  now my advice formula starts
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was so
0.05%:  so clearly the formula is most
0.05%:  this is fun! I
0.05%:  my advice formula is not so
0.05%:  I agree
0.05%:  my advice formula shows
0.05%:  clearly I was not
0.05%:  this advice formula is now my
0.05%:  my last advice formula unless
0.05%:  so clearly I should get
0.05%:  so my advice is awful
0.05%:  this is now my
0.05%:  this last one was very
0.05%:  so clearly this formula grows st
0.05%:  my formula is out
0.05%:  so this may
0.05%:  so let
0.05%:  you must
0.07%:  you must have
0.05%:  those last ones are
0.05%:  so I guess that wasn
0.05%:  would
0.05%:  so clearly nurses should write
0.05%:  whatever I guess.
0.05%:  what is your
0.05%:  I must confess.
0.05%:  I guess my formula is racist
0.05%:  my new advice formula results
0.05%:  I said nurses
0.05%:  clearly I have got
0.05%:  I guess that advice formula will
0.05%:  that one was my favour
0.05%:  my last formula is less generic
0.05%:  this formula is valid
0.05%:  so clearly I never said
0.05%:  their advice
0.05%:  that one is really good!
0.05%:  the formula is almost
0.05%:  medical
0.05%:  so the results vary
0.05%:  I have clearly sur
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is not a
0.05%:  that one is clearly more
0.05%:  clearly I went
0.06%:  clearly I went over
0.05%:  listen. I am
0.05%:  I screw
0.05%:  I ran out of ideas
0.05%:  my advice formula is useless! I
0.05%:  so I clearly have issues
0.05%:  I gave myself an
0.05%:  my last advice formula got
0.05%:  I guess my form
0.05%:  you made
0.05%:  after writing
0.05%:  clearly this was never a
0.05%:  listen. I have clearly
0.05%:  so clearly I must have missed a
0.05%:  clearly this formula is so over
0.05%:  this advice formula is great! I
0.05%:  turn
0.05%:  so my last advice is for all
0.05%:  I win.
0.05%:  well if
0.05%:  now this advice formula is less
0.05%:  this formula is closing
0.05%:  this last one is a
0.05%:  so this turns
0.05%:  you are
0.05%:  if we
0.05%:  the formula is over now
0.05%:  my last advice formula is too
0.05%:  well listen
0.05%:  I have more!
0.05%:  clearly I have to figure
0.05%:  my last advice is this!
0.05%:  my last clue
0.05%:  our
0.05%:  so this formula IS really
0.05%:  my formula is the worst ever
0.05%:  my advice for nurses must
0.05%:  this formula could only
0.05%:  so my advice is all
0.05%:  who cares if it sounds
0.05%:  how is
0.05%:  the formula is a
0.05%:  I should call
0.05%:  so this is really
0.05%:  nurses I
0.05%:  so my advice rules aren
0.05%:  this was really fun. I guess
0.05%:  my new formula is great
0.05%:  I have a lot
0.05%:  my formula has several
0.05%:  that would
0.05%:  this new advice formula system
0.05%:  so my formula is now
0.05%:  so this is clearly an
0.05%:  I never claimed this was all
0.05%:  so I guess my advice formula hits
0.05%:  clearly this is worse
0.05%:  my new advice formula is great! I
0.05%:  so the formula gives
0.05%:  last night
0.24%:  last night was clearly
0.07%:  last night was clearly more
0.05%:  clearly this formula is a genius!
0.05%:  clearly I win this game!
0.05%:  I was sort
0.05%:  I guess the formula can still
0.05%:  this formula only gets less
0.05%:  now I have really
0.05%:  so I could use
0.05%:  my last advice is more for nurses
0.05%:  so much for staying
0.05%:  so my advice formula is still great.
0.05%:  I really should start forming
0.05%:  that was my version
0.05%:  not all my advice is great! I
0.05%:  every nurse
0.05%:  whatever. My formula is still rad
0.05%:  whatever! I am
0.05%:  that was a silly
0.05%:  so clearly this formula is SPE
0.05%:  I clearly have a
0.05%:  so clearly this formula gives us a
0.05%:  so my formula is a little screw
0.05%:  so my advice formula thing
0.05%:  nurses were
0.05%:  this formula is more clever
0.05%:  now I must
0.05%:  this game is over! I
0.05%:  whoever says I can
0.05%:  clearly I should write some songs
0.05%:  my last advice is for all nurses who get
0.05%:  the formula is still good
0.05%:  my formula has covered
0.05%:  my formula has covered all
0.05%:  clearly I have to find
0.05%:  my last lesson for
0.05%:  my formula still needs a
0.05%:  my last advice is for mon
0.05%:  this was a really long
0.05%:  I love my formula so
0.05%:  not all my advice forms
0.05%:  I have lots of
0.05%:  whatever! My formula is still more
0.05%:  my last custom
0.05%:  so all nurses have
0.05%:  so my advice formula is all right
0.05%:  this is my last round
0.05%:  my advice formula is now less
0.05%:  this is clearly a form
0.05%:  I am clearly the
0.05%:  that one is clearly less good!
0.05%:  so the formula was really
0.05%:  so that one is clearly awful
0.05%:  so this formula mostly
0.05%:  I was only
0.05%:  this formula is great. I love
0.05%:  this formula is leaving
0.05%:  this formula is really serving
0.05%:  clearly this formula is sound!
0.05%:  my last word goes
0.05%:  my last advice formula is wrong.
0.05%:  this was fun. I
0.05%:  well that is
0.05%:  so I guess my new formula still
0.05%:  my last words for this
0.05%:  I love you
0.05%:  this advice formula is really gross
0.06%:  this advice formula is really gross now
0.05%:  this new formula really is
0.05%:  well! I guess you can
0.05%:  so much for nurse
0.05%:  I guess it could
0.05%:  this one is clearly worse
0.05%:  now this is all
0.05%:  this formula gets old.
0.05%:  I love this system.
0.05%:  this formula is clearly not vers
0.05%:  a
0.05%:  that is really gross and
0.05%:  I guess nurses have to
0.05%:  I guess this formula will come
0.05%:  this game is over. I
0.05%:  that one really is awful. I
0.05%:  clearly this formula is ir
0.05%:  this formula is even less
0.05%:  my advice is great
0.05%:  so clearly there was
0.05%:  so my advice formula has lots
0.05%:  so I never said this
0.54%:  so I never said this formula
0.08%:  so I never said this formula was gr
0.05%:  listen. I am clearly
0.05%:  I never said my formula has
0.05%:  I will never use my
0.39%:  I will never use my formula
0.09%:  I will never use my formula to
0.05%:  I will never use my formula that
0.05%:  I guess this was a really
0.05%:  this formula clearly runs its
0.05%:  this last one was really forced. I
0.05%:  that one really could
0.05%:  one more.
0.05%:  so my last formula turned
0.05%:  I really have to figure
0.05%:  the formula needs
0.05%:  this advice formula is DE
0.05%:  I guess my formula is a little cr
0.05%:  serious
0.05%:  clearly this is for
0.05%:  they were
0.05%:  so my last advice was for
0.05%:  with nurses it
0.05%:  I guess this formula was a
0.05%:  my last word of
0.05%:  I may have lost it
0.05%:  my last advice for nurses was the
0.05%:  my head is full now
0.05%:  I guess!
0.05%:  nuclear
0.05%:  this is my last answer. I
0.05%:  now this advice formula is really gross
0.05%:  my grand
0.05%:  whatever! I got
0.05%:  the only
0.05%:  my last advice is for all mothers.
0.05%:  I still have a few
0.05%:  I still have a few more
0.05%:  I could go forever with
0.05%:  I have clearly failed
0.05%:  last answer!
0.05%:  my ears
0.06%:  my ears are ring
0.06%:  my ears hurt
0.07%:  my ears hurt from
0.08%:  my ears hurt from all
0.05%:  clearly the formula is meant
0.05%:  well! I guess it turns
0.05%:  in all
0.05%:  this is clearly moving from
0.05%:  I may never
0.05%:  so my formula never
0.05%:  this was easy
0.05%:  my new advice formula is great. I
0.05%:  we really
0.13%:  we really should
0.08%:  we really should start
0.05%:  I will confess this
0.05%:  clearly I should write some of
0.05%:  those were mostly
0.05%:  I throw myself
0.05%:  I really love nurses.
0.05%:  my mouth is now
0.05%:  so clearly nurses get hurt
0.05%:  I guess nurses have a lot
0.05%:  this last one really IS
0.05%:  this version
0.05%:  I still have a long ways
0.05%:  so the formula sounds really racist
0.05%:  my formula still stands.
0.05%:  this was clearly an error
0.05%:  so my formula should
0.05%:  I ran out of ideas!
0.05%:  forget this advice!
0.05%:  so I guess if
0.05%:  so I guess my advice for writers
0.05%:  I figured this
0.05%:  it was harder for nurses. I
0.05%:  that one is gross. I
0.05%:  my formula is worse
0.05%:  I can do this for a really
0.05%:  my last word for this
0.05%:  my last generic
0.11%:  my last generic formula
0.08%:  my last generic formula was
0.05%:  clearly this is great!
0.05%:  so yeah. I
0.05%:  clearly the formula is so vers
0.05%:  this really doesn
0.05%:  well. I guess it
0.05%:  I may have run out of ideas
0.05%:  I guess my formula is invalid
0.05%:  I clearly have some limits!
0.05%:  this formula really is great. I don
0.05%:  my advice seems
0.05%:  all you have
0.05%:  what are nurses really
0.05%:  I guess this advice formula only lets
0.05%:  clearly this formula is gender
0.05%:  I guess the last one was
0.05%:  this advice formula is T
0.05%:  so I never said this formula was P
0.05%:  the formula is clearly not as
0.05%:  the formula is clearly not as vers
0.05%:  I will never use this for
0.05%:  my advice formula still has serious
0.05%:  this is over now
0.05%:  I guess this formula covers all my
0.05%:  so clearly that one was
0.05%:  so yeah. I guess
0.05%:  it was really fun
0.05%:  I win!
0.05%:  those are really
0.05%:  my advice formula is a little gross
0.16%:  my advice formula is a little gross when
0.05%:  well! I guess this advice
0.43%:  well! I guess this advice formula
0.25%:  well! I guess this advice formula isn
0.25%:  well! I guess this advice formula is
0.05%:  the rest
0.05%:  that one was clever
0.05%:  clearly this formula is inv
0.05%:  so that advice formula isn
0.05%:  these all
0.05%:  these all sound awful
0.05%:  this is my last advice formula. D
0.05%:  my formula still has a
0.05%:  turns out all my form
0.05%:  nurses are way
0.05%:  the formula is clearly driving
0.05%:  so my formula has its down
0.05%:  now my advice formula is so
0.05%:  clearly nurses are hurt
0.05%:  I never said this formula was luc
0.05%:  I love this formula and am
0.05%:  this formula is now over.
0.05%:  this formula is not as vers
0.05%:  those were all from my
0.05%:  my last advice is for all the women
0.05%:  so nurses are awful
0.05%:  so this wasn
0.05%:  somehow
0.05%:  it was clearly
0.05%:  my advice formula also
0.05%:  my last advice turns
0.05%:  I guess they can
0.05%:  this was never my
0.05%:  this formula is clearly S
0.05%:  this is all I got for
0.32%:  this is all I got for nurses
0.18%:  this is all I got for nurses!
0.05%:  what are you doing
0.05%:  I never said this was logical.
0.05%:  that one was fully
0.05%:  my advice formula is genius!
0.05%:  I really should start saving some
0.05%:  clearly I am now
0.05%:  so my formula sort
0.05%:  my last advice is for PE
0.05%:  this is clearly an awful
0.05%:  the formula clearly runs its
0.05%:  this will never get
0.12%:  this will never get old.
0.05%:  last caller
0.05%:  well I can
0.05%:  so clearly I have some limits.
0.05%:  to sum
0.05%:  this one is really gross
0.05%:  my last formula is not
0.05%:  I guess we all have
0.49%:  I guess we all have our limits!
0.05%:  so clearly I have limited
0.05%:  so my advice for nurses still
0.05%:  yes this
0.27%:  yes this formula
0.07%:  yes this formula can
0.06%:  yes this formula could
0.05%:  my formula has one
0.05%:  this last one was clearly more
0.05%:  well! I guess that covers E
0.05%:  my formula is not as clever
0.05%:  my formula can use
0.05%:  I guess my advice is still
0.05%:  I have clearly out
0.05%:  I am now
0.05%:  whatever. My formula is so
0.05%:  it gets harder now.
0.05%:  I declare
0.34%:  I declare this formula
0.05%:  I declare myself
0.05%:  clearly I have said
0.05%:  my advice formula is S
0.05%:  clearly the formula is in
0.05%:  I guess the formula is sort
0.05%:  you might want
0.05%:  clearly we have a
0.05%:  this formula was clearly over
0.05%:  my formula sounds a
0.20%:  my formula sounds a little worse
0.09%:  my formula sounds a little worse each
0.08%:  my formula sounds a little gross
0.05%:  clearly this formula is mor
0.05%:  clearly this formula is EP
0.05%:  this formula only covers 
0.05%:  this formula will never go
0.05%:  so this formula is really strong
0.05%:  those are all my
0.05%:  what if you
0.05%:  if you have
0.05%:  turns out all advice
0.05%:  so I guess this only
0.05%:  so this formula is really great!
0.05%:  clearly this is not as
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was a little gr
0.05%:  this was really more
0.05%:  this formula is clearly never to
0.05%:  so clearly the formula grows tired
0.05%:  the formula is clear
0.05%:  my friends. I must
0.05%:  so I guess my formula covers E
0.05%:  so my formula starts
0.05%:  yes. I will confess
0.05%:  a lot of nurses
0.06%:  a lot of nurses will
0.05%:  this could go forever
0.05%:  after this I will
0.18%:  after this I will never
0.05%:  my advice formula is genius.
0.05%:  I guess the formula is limited
0.05%:  I will give myself credit
0.05%:  clearly this is as
0.05%:  I ran out of ideas.
0.05%:  my last form is
0.05%:  I T
0.05%:  not all my advice is so useful
0.05%:  whatever! I can do
0.05%:  I love this formula already.
0.05%:  my formula will not
0.05%:  so my formula could have
0.05%:  so clearly this formula sort
0.05%:  my final advice.
0.05%:  so I never said my form
0.05%:  so this formula covers all
0.05%:  so my formula is still not
0.05%:  that one is less clearly
0.05%:  I guess you won
0.05%:  I guess my formula ran
0.05%:  what I really
0.05%:  my fr
0.05%:  so clearly I should write for
0.05%:  and this
0.05%:  this formula is not always
0.05%:  so this formula is only valid
0.05%:  listen. I have a
0.05%:  so my advice formula is sorta
0.05%:  turns out my advice is worse
0.05%:  so clearly I should not
0.05%:  clearly this formula is a r
0.13%:  clearly this formula is a rousing
0.05%:  so most
0.05%:  so most nurses
0.06%:  so most nurses will
0.05%:  that was really clever
0.05%:  I guess this advice formula mostly
0.05%:  my friend. I will
0.05%:  my last few
0.05%:  my last name will
0.06%:  my last name will forever
0.05%:  my advice formula is now DE
0.05%:  I guess that one is really awful
0.05%:  this formula was clearly DE
0.05%:  clearly I love this format
0.05%:  not all my advice is useful or
0.05%:  I should really start saving some
0.05%:  the formula is clearly over.
0.05%:  whatever! My formula is still rad
0.05%:  that was really gross for
0.05%:  whatever. I still don
0.05%:  I will admit my
0.05%:  I will admit my last
0.05%:  that one was clearly for
0.05%:  my last advice formula is how nurses
0.05%:  for reals now
0.05%:  closing my
0.05%:  so the formula gets less
0.05%:  clearly this formula is TE
0.05%:  I really should start using some
0.05%:  also nurses are
0.05%:  my formula is so great
0.05%:  I never said this formula was ST
0.05%:  my last nerve is shot
0.05%:  it got really
0.05%:  this is my last advice of
0.05%:  my friends! I have a
0.05%:  we covered all
0.05%:  this was all very
0.05%:  this was all very fun
0.05%:  clearly this formula is run
0.05%:  my formula does not
0.05%:  so the formula turns
0.05%:  that one clearly fails
0.05%:  my formula has gotten weird
0.05%:  this is not really
0.05%:  this formula does not really
0.05%:  that was me
0.05%:  so finally
0.05%:  this feels
0.05%:  not all my advice is awesome
0.07%:  not all my advice is awesome!
0.05%:  my last advice is for nurses. I
0.05%:  so my formula was never
0.05%:  nurses have a
0.05%:  who are
0.05%:  who are nurses
0.05%:  so clearly the nurses would
0.05%:  I love this game.
0.05%:  my formula is less clever than it was
0.05%:  so I really should start
0.05%:  my last advice is still
0.05%:  my last advice is still for
0.05%:  I may have lost control
0.05%:  this got weird!
0.05%:  my last class ends
0.05%:  at
0.05%:  I guess you won this
0.05%:  the formula is not
0.06%:  the formula is not really
0.05%:  enough self
0.04%:  that really sounds less
0.04%:  the formula gets worse
0.04%:  it was mostly
0.04%:  now my formula is over
0.04%:  sorry for the racism
0.04%:  listen. My formula is great!
0.04%:  I guess my formula does still
0.04%:  now clearly this formula does
0.04%:  true story
0.04%:  this advice is mostly awful
0.04%:  listen. My advice formula is great!
0.04%:  I could really go
0.06%:  I could really go for
0.10%:  I could really go for a nurse
0.04%:  this list
0.04%:  so I clearly have more
0.04%:  nurses are a hard
0.04%:  that one was really gross for
0.04%:  so my formula is clever
0.04%:  so clearly I was right and
0.04%:  unless they
0.04%:  whatever. I am
0.04%:  might
0.04%:  so I guess your advice
0.04%:  so clearly this formula runs its
0.04%:  my formula is now useless.
0.04%:  I have lost my
0.04%:  clearly no
0.04%:  I assume
0.04%:  this advice formula really runs
0.04%:  that reminds me of
0.04%:  I guess my formula is a little weird.
0.04%:  that was less useful
0.04%:  last call for random ver
0.04%:  surely
0.05%:  surely that
0.04%:  so clearly nurses must have
0.04%:  it got really hard
0.04%:  this last one was forced.
0.04%:  so the formula is really more
0.04%:  that advice was less useful
0.04%:  clearly those last ones
0.04%:  this advice formula is my
0.04%:  my friends I
0.06%:  my friends I have
0.04%:  whatever it
0.04%:  that one was really close
0.04%:  I would listen
0.04%:  my last formula was un
0.04%:  I guess my formula is now
0.04%:  my last advice is for n
0.04%:  so this advice formula only seems
0.04%:  clearly this formula is a genius move
0.04%:  the formula is over. I
0.04%:  this is my last formula ever!
0.04%:  this formula is doing all my
0.04%:  so my advice formula is shallow
0.04%:  that one was all me!
0.04%:  so my formula also
0.04%:  forget I said all this
0.04%:  I guess this is a
0.04%:  I have my formula down
0.04%:  so clearly this is never
0.04%:  there I crossed
0.04%:  my formula is a little gross
0.04%:  I can usually
0.04%:  I never claimed it
0.04%:  my final words here
0.04%:  clearly I had
0.04%:  enough advice
0.06%:  enough advice for
0.04%:  give me a sec
0.04%:  so clearly I want
0.04%:  clearly nurses should get first
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula has now
0.04%:  my advice for nurses is also
0.04%:  so much for trying to sell
0.04%:  this advice formula got
0.06%:  this advice formula got really
0.04%:  this formula is more vers
0.04%:  my friends! I leave
0.04%:  my formula is hard
0.04%:  now you should
0.04%:  you caught me. I ran
0.04%:  clearly this formula grows tired as
0.04%:  this is coming
0.10%:  this is coming from
0.04%:  the last one clearly
0.04%:  so my formula is great and
0.04%:  so I guess the moral is
0.04%:  so my advice formula is not great.
0.04%:  so clearly this gets worse
0.04%:  clearly nurses are too
0.05%:  clearly nurses are too smart
0.04%:  my last advice is for all mothers!
0.04%:  so clearly I never should
0.04%:  my last one is this
0.04%:  I forgot nurses are called
0.04%:  forgot
0.25%:  forgot nurses
0.13%:  forgot nurses.
0.08%:  forgot nurses!
0.04%:  now that I say
0.04%:  so clearly the formula is DE
0.04%:  my advice formula has rules
0.04%:  my turns
0.09%:  my turns over.
0.04%:  that one could really mess
0.04%:  now all I have
0.07%:  now all I have to do is figure
0.04%:  my last real
0.09%:  my last real advice
0.04%:  so my advice formula is the worst.
0.04%:  so clearly this formula reminds
0.04%:  all my friends who
0.04%:  listen. My formula has its
0.04%:  my formula is less than
0.04%:  this formula is weird
0.04%:  that sounds really awful so
0.04%:  clearly this formula is awesome. I don
0.04%:  this last one is clearly a
0.04%:  this one is awful!
0.04%:  I might still
0.04%:  clearly this formula and its
0.04%:  that one really IS
0.05%:  that one really IS less
0.05%:  that one really IS awful
0.04%:  my formula is T
0.04%:  guess what!
0.04%:  so I guess this all
0.04%:  so clearly nurses are hard
0.04%:  last one! I
0.04%:  I was never really that
0.04%:  all I have left is doctors!
0.04%:  this formula is over now!
0.04%:  clearly this formula gets me
0.04%:  I guess my new
0.28%:  I guess my new formula
0.06%:  I guess my new formula is still
0.05%:  I guess my new formula has
0.04%:  I never said my formula was rig
0.04%:  my last advice is for an
0.04%:  my advice formula has one
0.04%:  close
0.07%:  close your
0.05%:  close your mouth
0.04%:  you can ST
0.04%:  that advice isn
0.04%:  I must have missed a
0.04%:  clearly I have some sort
0.04%:  I guess this formula is even
0.04%:  this formula is also
0.04%:  this formula was only
0.04%:  my formula is a little gross when
0.04%:  so my advice formula is worse
0.11%:  so my advice formula is worse than I
0.04%:  so clearly I should go
0.04%:  this last one was clearly from
0.04%:  so clearly the formula is great.
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula has sort
0.04%:  my mind is full!
0.04%:  so I usually
0.04%:  so my advice will
0.04%:  clearly this formula is moving us
0.28%:  clearly this formula is moving us towards
0.04%:  whatever. I clearly don
0.04%:  that one is awful. My
0.04%:  my advice formula is strong!
0.04%:  where are all my
0.04%:  this is great. I could
0.04%:  whatever. My formula is still more
0.04%:  screw you all forever
0.04%:  my advice for nurses has a
0.04%:  if I never say
0.04%:  so your turn
0.04%:  so you might
0.04%:  my formula was great
0.04%:  clearly the formula is great!
0.04%:  that one screw
0.04%:  my last advice is for sm
0.04%:  the last one was silly.
0.04%:  holy cow
0.04%:  my mind is full right
0.04%:  so this formula is a
0.04%:  that was really gross even
0.04%:  well you
0.04%:  that was really good. I
0.04%:  so my formula is racist
0.04%:  I should start saying
0.04%:  that was closer
0.04%:  I guess your last
0.04%:  this is all I got for now.
0.04%:  I have to go write all
0.04%:  now I have to figure
0.04%:  my last advice formula is true
0.04%:  nurses were hard
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was a little grim. I
0.04%:  this formula is clearly vers
0.04%:  my last words of
0.04%:  so clearly I win this
0.04%:  that came
0.04%:  so this formula is not very
0.04%:  if nurses are
0.04%:  my final advice here
0.04%:  turns out I had
0.04%:  so all nurses are evil.
0.04%:  sounds awful
0.04%:  so this clearly doesn
0.04%:  saying
0.04%:  I guess you can tell this
0.04%:  I guess you can tell this was
0.04%:  so clearly this formula raises
0.04%:  I guess this formula is really narrow!
0.04%:  my last advice is for sing
0.04%:  my formula won
0.04%:  so I guess the advice
0.20%:  so I guess the advice formula
0.14%:  so I guess the advice formula isn
0.09%:  so I guess the advice formula only
0.09%:  so I guess the advice formula is
0.04%:  forget nurses. I was
0.04%:  so clearly nurses have it good!
0.04%:  I guess my new formula still
0.04%:  this formula could last
0.04%:  this is clearly some
0.04%:  any last guess
0.04%:  clearly this formula is great now
0.04%:  hear me out!
0.04%:  I should give
0.06%:  I should give myself
0.04%:  most of my
0.10%:  most of my advice
0.06%:  most of my advice still
0.04%:  I guess my last formula covers
0.04%:  TIME
0.04%:  so really I
0.05%:  so really I should
0.04%:  so you should
0.04%:  so this formula is clearly genius
0.04%:  my formula is good.
0.04%:  I already have
0.04%:  my last word on the issue
0.04%:  my last advice is for mar
0.04%:  I wouldn
0.04%:  my last formula is generic
0.04%:  whatever! My formula is sound
0.04%:  clearly when
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is str
0.04%:  I guess this one
0.04%:  my formula is a little won
0.04%:  there are only
0.04%:  this formula is really not as
0.04%:  I give myself an
0.04%:  so my advice formula was stolen
0.04%:  so clearly I should start wearing
0.04%:  my advice formula is also
0.04%:  my last advice was sort
0.04%:  my secret
0.42%:  my secret formula
0.20%:  my secret formula has
0.11%:  my secret formula was
0.11%:  my secret formula isn
0.08%:  my secret formula is now
0.07%:  my secret formula is out
0.07%:  my secret formula is out!
0.05%:  my secret formula is over
0.05%:  my secret formula is showing
0.04%:  my secret formula has now
0.04%:  that was ugly
0.04%:  I guess my formula also covers
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was all
0.04%:  I have to run!
0.04%:  my formula still isn
0.04%:  it sounds awful.
0.04%:  I could totally
0.04%:  well I guess that one
0.04%:  for nurses it was
0.04%:  I guess that really isn
0.04%:  so I lied.
0.04%:  I guess that advice isn
0.04%:  clearly I have run out of steam!
0.04%:  this formula runs its
0.04%:  I guess my last failure wasn
0.04%:  listen. I should
0.04%:  so my new formula is less
0.04%:  this formula is all sorts
0.04%:  so I never said this formula is
0.04%:  so this formula gets
0.04%:  whoever comes
0.04%:  my formula is doing
0.07%:  my formula is doing all
0.04%:  my last round was free
0.04%:  I guess my formula has lost
0.04%:  I never said my formula was ST
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula hits its
0.04%:  clearly this is a good
0.50%:  clearly this is a good formula
0.29%:  clearly this is a good formula!
0.08%:  clearly this is a good formula. I
0.04%:  so all nurses should get
0.04%:  so whatever you
0.04%:  I sort of ran
0.04%:  this is really fun. I could
0.04%:  so clearly that one is
0.04%:  listen! I really
0.04%:  that sounds v
0.04%:  I guess this formula is way
0.04%:  clearly I have no limits
0.04%:  my last advice is for all nurses out
0.04%:  that one is really gross! I
0.04%:  I will never say this formula gets
0.04%:  clearly I should write songs for
0.04%:  my last advice is for us all
0.04%:  nurses are a little scary
0.04%:  my formula has its draw
0.04%:  clearly I have nurses
0.04%:  that really IS
0.04%:  this gives
0.04%:  I guess this formula ends
0.04%:  so nurses should get
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is rad
0.04%:  this went from really good
0.04%:  I guess my new advice
0.21%:  I guess my new advice formula has
0.19%:  I guess my new advice formula is still
0.19%:  I guess my new advice formula still
0.10%:  I guess my new advice formula has its
0.06%:  I guess my new advice formula is sort
0.04%:  I will grant this
0.04%:  this is all very fun
0.04%:  clearly this formula is ruined.
0.04%:  this formula is really cr
0.04%:  this was my last ever
0.04%:  they all sound awful.
0.04%:  my last advice formula is long
0.04%:  that was gross. My formula isn
0.04%:  my last advice I
0.04%:  the formula gets weird
0.04%:  clearly this formula is st
0.04%:  clearly this formula is saving me
0.04%:  that one is less fl
0.04%:  clearly nurses do more
0.04%:  I guess this formula is already
0.04%:  I can still do this!
0.04%:  this is really good.
0.04%:  so this formula will not
0.04%:  my friend. I have to
0.04%:  for real.
0.04%:  yes! I have
0.04%:  now this formula is less
0.04%:  this formula is nearly
0.04%:  my last advise is for
0.04%:  my friends are right.
0.04%:  I guess the formula limits
0.04%:  I guess the only
0.04%:  forget nurses! I have
0.04%:  clearly this formula is now a
0.04%:  I guess this formula really covers it
0.04%:  my formula is all
0.04%:  my last words shall
0.04%:  now the
0.15%:  now the formula
0.24%:  now the formula is clearly
0.07%:  now the formula is really
0.04%:  clearly I have more writing
0.04%:  this was my last good formula
0.04%:  the last one really is
0.04%:  so I guess my advice formula is a little won
0.04%:  I deserve that
0.04%:  I guess this advice formula sort
0.04%:  my last one is for writers
0.04%:  all I want
0.05%:  all I want is for
0.04%:  clearly someone
0.04%:  that never
0.04%:  I never said my formula was short.
0.04%:  I deserve this.
0.04%:  my advice formula got less
0.04%:  for serious
0.04%:  moving forward
0.04%:  so my formula is a little weird
0.04%:  I never said my formula was logic
0.04%:  I could go on all
0.04%:  he
0.04%:  I guess that really is
0.04%:  now that is really
0.04%:  my last advice is for grown
0.04%:  my formula is racist and
0.04%:  this was mostly for me.
0.04%:  this is my last formula! I
0.04%:  so clearly I am the
0.06%:  so clearly I am the world
0.04%:  so clearly I should write some
0.04%:  this formula is clearly D
0.04%:  I admit it was
0.04%:  so while
0.04%:  my formula is now useless!
0.04%:  now this formula is scary
0.04%:  this formula is clearly on
0.04%:  I have totally
0.10%:  I have totally run
0.04%:  you were
0.14%:  you were right.
0.12%:  you were right!
0.05%:  you were right. I
0.04%:  you were right! I
0.04%:  so there are limits
0.04%:  clearly their
0.04%:  I really have to run
0.04%:  all I have left are words
0.04%:  this formula is really strong! I
0.04%:  this is really fun! I love
0.04%:  that one was largely
0.04%:  my last source
0.04%:  so yes.
0.04%:  enough! My
0.09%:  enough! My formula
0.04%:  that one was closer
0.04%:  that one is clearly worse. I
0.04%:  my advice formula is trash
0.04%:  turns out my advice follows
0.04%:  I M
0.04%:  that was less fun
0.04%:  clearly this formula is a mess
0.04%:  yes. I admit
0.04%:  you st
0.04%:  my formula has given
0.04%:  I would really rather
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is unt
0.04%:  this means
0.04%:  listen. I will
0.04%:  so I guess my last advice formula went
0.04%:  clearly I love this.
0.04%:  whatever! My formula is not
0.04%:  whatever. My formula is solid
0.04%:  whoever told
0.04%:  my last advice formula is serious.
0.04%:  I guess this formula is really over
0.04%:  those all sound awful
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is E
0.04%:  that one I really
0.04%:  so clearly this formula gives rise
0.04%:  less
0.04%:  for nurses I guess that advice
0.04%:  now I totally
0.04%:  my advice is for nurses who are
0.04%:  I have clearly gone
0.04%:  are we still
0.04%:  are we still having
0.04%:  clearly I must have lost
0.04%:  so we have
0.04%:  so clearly nurses would rather I
0.04%:  this formula still isn
0.04%:  this is over! I
0.04%:  so my new advice formula rules
0.04%:  I never said my formula was el
0.04%:  the formula is clearly wearing out
0.04%:  so this formula only gives me
0.04%:  clearly this formula is a strong
0.04%:  so my last advice formula won
0.04%:  I must really have
0.04%:  this formula seems really
0.04%:  this reminds me of all
0.04%:  I should really start caring for
0.04%:  I should really start using some
0.04%:  so my formula needs a
0.04%:  final shot
0.04%:  this new advice formula may
0.04%:  the rest of my advice
0.06%:  the rest of my advice will
0.04%:  I confess! My
0.04%:  this got really weird.
0.04%:  so this is all very
0.04%:  my last advice is from now
0.04%:  I have to confess!
0.04%:  my last advice wasn
0.04%:  whatever d
0.04%:  clearly the formula is doing most
0.04%:  my formula is so vers
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula is as
0.04%:  so I guess my formula is invalid
0.04%:  so it usually doesn
0.04%:  now the formula clearly
0.04%:  so my formula is less general
0.04%:  my last advice is for um
0.04%:  so whoever
0.04%:  so my formula is never
0.04%:  I guess this formula was only ever
0.04%:  clearly it gets harder as
0.04%:  now I should really get
0.04%:  my formula has an
0.04%:  those are clearly
0.04%:  so my advice formula is ultra
0.04%:  I guess this formula was really more
0.04%:  so clearly the formula is wrong.
0.04%:  this formula is clearly some
0.04%:  so this advice formula won
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is drawing
0.04%:  so this formula really does
0.04%:  I confess that
0.04%:  so my advice formula los
0.04%:  my formula was not
0.04%:  so clearly the world
0.04%:  silly
0.04%:  well I guess my advice for
0.04%:  clearly this formula is more and
0.04%:  so my advice formula still sort
0.04%:  that was less clear
0.04%:  clearly this formula must go
0.04%:  clearly this formula must go down
0.04%:  my friend! I am
0.04%:  I guess this will only ever
0.04%:  this new advice formula is mostly
0.04%:  clearly this is a gold mine.
0.04%:  seems
0.04%:  not all ver
0.04%:  this new advice formula is almost
0.04%:  there!
0.04%:  clearly I must have some
0.04%:  nur
0.56%:  nursery schools
0.42%:  nursery school
0.20%:  nursery schools!
0.10%:  nursery schools are
0.09%:  nursery schools.
0.04%:  this formula really is good
0.04%:  the formula only gets worse as
0.04%:  I guess my last advice formula is how
0.04%:  this new formula is clearly a
0.04%:  the last one is awful!
0.04%:  never forget
0.04%:  clearly I was using
0.04%:  does
0.04%:  does that cover
0.04%:  for real!
0.04%:  for nurses that was really good
0.04%:  so really this
0.32%:  so really this formula
0.11%:  so really this formula doesn
0.04%:  so really this formula isn
0.04%:  I really have run
0.07%:  I really have run out of words
0.04%:  all my advice is now
0.04%:  those weren
0.04%:  so clearly I should start a new
0.04%:  go
0.04%:  my last advice is free. I
0.04%:  I still have some friends
0.04%:  that one IS really
0.04%:  so clearly the formula is missing a word
0.04%:  clearly this formula is done. I
0.04%:  clearly this is not as useful
0.04%:  clearly this formula is driven
0.04%:  clearly this is useful!
0.04%:  I will never do that
0.04%:  so it clearly
0.04%:  this was really fun. I could
0.04%:  clearly I have more to
0.04%:  so clearly I have some limits!
0.04%:  my friend has a
0.04%:  I really should start caring for
0.04%:  that sounds way scar
0.04%:  so clearly I should use
0.04%:  my formula is still a
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses is T
0.04%:  I really should start narrow
0.04%:  sorry for all the nurses
0.04%:  so my formula turned
0.04%:  so clearly this formula wins
0.04%:  now my last
0.07%:  now my last advice
0.23%:  now my last advice formula
0.08%:  now my last advice is for
0.05%:  now my last advice formula is this
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses will result
0.04%:  yes I will grant
0.04%:  my last advice rule for
0.12%:  my last advice rule for nurses
0.13%:  my last advice rule for nurses was
0.04%:  that sounds less favour
0.04%:  clearly this is great.
0.04%:  I really could use
0.04%:  my formula has got
0.04%:  I have lost all
0.04%:  this formula may sound racist
0.04%:  so this formula will never get
0.04%:  now it really
0.04%:  so turns out my
0.14%:  so turns out my advice
0.04%:  this last one is clearly for
0.04%:  so my last advice formula thing
0.04%:  that was really l
0.04%:  so clearly I have limits
0.04%:  I guess my last advice is to
0.04%:  clearly this formula is nuts.
0.04%:  I should really start using comm
0.04%:  turns out advice for
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula is not so
0.04%:  my advice formula has grown st
0.04%:  that sounds way more evil
0.04%:  I have to say!
0.04%:  you caught me! I never
0.05%:  you caught me! I never said
0.04%:  my formula has never
0.04%:  my last formula is sort
0.04%:  now clearly this formula is so
0.04%:  my formula has a lot
0.04%:  this formula is clearly T
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses right
0.04%:  one last try.
0.04%:  that one is clearly self
0.04%:  clearly this formula ain
0.04%:  that was clearly less good
0.04%:  that was silly!
0.04%:  what else
0.04%:  my formula has a little
0.04%:  my advice formula is useless in
0.04%:  this is clearly losing
0.04%:  I clearly have run
0.11%:  I clearly have run out of words
0.07%:  I clearly have run out of steam
0.05%:  I clearly have run out of ideas
0.05%:  I clearly have run out of steam.
0.04%:  who is
0.04%:  I never said my formula was luc
0.04%:  my last advice is serious.
0.04%:  clearly this means we
0.04%:  turns out my form
0.04%:  I mostly
0.04%:  so the formula allows
0.04%:  clearly this is more of
0.04%:  whatever. I got
0.04%:  this was really more for
0.04%:  I clearly win
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is DEE
0.04%:  so clearly this formula got
0.04%:  clearly this formula got weird
0.04%:  this advice formula only gets worse!
0.04%:  this advice formula is a
0.04%:  forget nurses! My
0.12%:  forget nurses! My advice
0.04%:  so this formula may sound
0.04%:  this formula is so great I
0.04%:  we should move
0.04%:  last call for this
0.14%:  last call for this round
0.04%:  so I will
0.04%:  clearly some of this
0.04%:  all of
0.04%:  I guess the formula is valid
0.04%:  so not
0.07%:  so not all
0.08%:  so not all advice
0.08%:  so not all advice is useful
0.06%:  so not all advice is useful!
0.05%:  so not really
0.05%:  so not all advice is useful.
0.04%:  my formula is genius
0.04%:  this formula is clearly wearing out
0.04%:  you got me! I have
0.04%:  so clearly that formula isn
0.04%:  they must
0.04%:  my new advice form
0.04%:  listen. My formula is good
0.04%:  my final advice rule
0.04%:  my last words!
0.04%:  clearly I should write an
0.04%:  this formula is great and I will use
0.04%:  so my formula gets old
0.04%:  my last advice is how
0.04%:  my last advice was free!
0.04%:  this formula was clearly genius
0.04%:  the first one was clearly
0.04%:  this advice formula won
0.04%:  this formula really does run
0.04%:  my last one is a
0.04%:  there.
0.04%:  that one was less clear.
0.04%:  I am clearly the most
0.04%:  this formula is clearly over now!
0.04%:  so really this formula can
0.04%:  my friends! I have got
0.04%:  this is my last advice for now! I
0.04%:  my advice for nurses who
0.04%:  not all are
0.04%:  my last show
0.04%:  so I guess my advice formula is well
0.04%:  that one is less good
0.04%:  that one is T
0.04%:  forget it! I clearly
0.05%:  forget it! I clearly have
0.04%:  I never said my formula was EMP
0.04%:  now clearly this formula is over!
0.04%:  I still can
0.04%:  whatever man! My
0.22%:  whatever man! My formula
0.18%:  whatever man! My formula is still
0.15%:  whatever man! My formula still
0.06%:  whatever man! My formula is still good
0.04%:  I swear this formula can
0.04%:  I guess this advice formula really won
0.04%:  so my advice formula is right on
0.04%:  having said
0.04%:  you could have
0.04%:  so my formula holds
0.04%:  clearly I want this
0.05%:  clearly I want this formula
0.04%:  not really sure who
0.04%:  I guess my formula has a lot
0.04%:  very well
0.04%:  for the love
0.04%:  I swear this last
0.04%:  I am D
0.04%:  so clearly this wouldn
0.04%:  it might sound
0.04%:  that was really grim!
0.04%:  this formula is strong
0.04%:  so that one was clearly
0.04%:  my formula is all used
0.04%:  you caught me. I never
0.04%:  very good
0.04%:  I guess my advice is not
0.04%:  all the credit
0.09%:  all the credit for
0.04%:  sorry for all those
0.04%:  my last formula turned
0.04%:  I will give you credit
0.04%:  you should start selling
0.04%:  this formula could only ever
0.04%:  this formula gets worse and
0.04%:  clearly nurses are sad
0.04%:  clearly it gets harder from
0.04%:  clearly I have gone
0.04%:  frig man
0.04%:  clearly I have not master
0.04%:  my last advice formula. I
0.04%:  that one is more
0.04%:  there must
0.04%:  this new formula is clearly great
0.04%:  this formula was really more
0.04%:  smart
0.04%:  smart guy
0.04%:  not every field
0.04%:  for real now
0.04%:  I guess my last advice is for all
0.04%:  so the formula is clever
0.04%:  using this
0.22%:  using this formula is
0.23%:  using this formula is clearly
0.21%:  using this formula I will
0.19%:  using this formula I clearly
0.09%:  using this formula is really
0.08%:  using this formula was
0.07%:  using this formula will
0.07%:  using this formula I am
0.11%:  using this formula I am clearly
0.06%:  using this formula I really
0.05%:  using this formula was really
0.05%:  using this formula we
0.04%:  that is clearly a
0.04%:  well! I guess my
0.21%:  well! I guess my formula
0.18%:  well! I guess my formula doesn
0.11%:  well! I guess my formula is
0.10%:  well! I guess my advice
1.18%:  well! I guess my advice formula
0.92%:  well! I guess my advice formula isn
0.90%:  well! I guess my advice formula is
0.44%:  well! I guess my advice formula has
0.62%:  well! I guess my advice formula has its
0.11%:  well! I guess my advice formula is not
0.10%:  well! I guess my formula has
0.09%:  well! I guess my advice formula is a
0.08%:  well! I guess my formula covers
0.08%:  well! I guess my advice formula is sort
0.08%:  well! I guess my formula isn
0.06%:  well! I guess my formula can
0.05%:  well! I guess my advice formula is not as
0.05%:  well! I guess my formula does
0.04%:  that one is clearly for murder
0.04%:  clearly this formula gets worse around
0.04%:  I guess it runs
0.04%:  that one made
0.06%:  that one made me cry
0.04%:  my last advice for regular
0.04%:  my last advice is for all the nurses!
0.04%:  this formula is clearly so great
0.04%:  so I figured
0.04%:  clearly that one is worse
0.04%:  fine whatever
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is serving
0.04%:  last round
0.04%:  my last laugh line
0.04%:  I really must go
0.05%:  I really must go now!
0.04%:  no reg
0.13%:  no regrets!
0.08%:  no regrets.
0.04%:  that one is cr
0.04%:  this is clearly not as useful
0.04%:  I forgot nurses!
0.04%:  so my advice formula also
0.04%:  that was one
0.04%:  this formula is scary
0.04%:  that sounds really grim!
0.04%:  future
0.04%:  so the formula needs
0.04%:  finally this
0.04%:  my advice formula hits all
0.04%:  this formula was clearly given
0.04%:  I guess my formula is not as
0.04%:  nurses are a little hard!
0.04%:  whatever. My formula is not
0.04%:  that one is really weird!
0.04%:  clearly now I have
0.04%:  I clearly have issues.
0.04%:  forget this. My
0.05%:  forget this. My advice
0.04%:  whatever man! I still
0.04%:  my formula is in
0.04%:  I missed
0.04%:  my advice formula shows its
0.04%:  not all of my advice is so
0.04%:  I never said this formula was SE
0.04%:  my head is now
0.21%:  my head is now full
0.04%:  my head is now full.
0.04%:  my last answer for real!
0.04%:  my advice formula wins
0.04%:  I never claimed this formula was truly
0.04%:  I guess this advice formula was more
0.04%:  so this formula only gives us
0.04%:  clearly we should start forming
0.04%:  say
0.04%:  so clearly the formula turns
0.04%:  clearly this formula is wrong. I
0.04%:  whose
0.04%:  I guess that covers all my
0.20%:  I guess that covers all my friends
0.08%:  I guess that covers all my friends.
0.07%:  I guess that covers all my friends!
0.04%:  you won that
0.04%:  I guess this ends
0.04%:  I guess that advice is really
0.04%:  I will never admit this
0.18%:  I will never admit this formula
0.04%:  I guess my formula never
0.04%:  my advice formula is now so
0.04%:  I finally got
0.04%:  my advice formula has now sur
0.04%:  that was really gross. I couldn
0.04%:  this is great. I can
0.04%:  my last advice for nurses has
0.04%:  I admit this formula runs
0.04%:  I regret
0.04%:  I regret this
0.04%:  my last advice was the
0.04%:  clearly I have wasted
0.04%:  so this formula only ever
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is some
0.04%:  turns out all my advice was
0.04%:  so clearly this does
0.04%:  this is my last one for
0.04%:  some nurses
0.04%:  forget nurses. My last word
0.04%:  so the formula is sort
0.04%:  not really sure how I
0.04%:  this got weird real
0.04%:  you caught me! I don
0.04%:  this formula is clearly genius! I
0.04%:  all the nurses I
0.04%:  I have a million
0.04%:  this formula is almost over
0.04%:  those are all my favour
0.04%:  my advice formula is great. I will
0.04%:  listen. I could
0.04%:  my formula is also
0.04%:  this advice is all
0.04%:  this is my new career
0.04%:  this is my new career!
0.04%:  my last advice I will
0.04%:  my secret formula is out.
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was also
0.04%:  so clearly this formula DES
0.04%:  whatever! My formula is a
0.04%:  that one was me
0.04%:  I never claimed this formula to
0.04%:  so my formula is the
0.07%:  so my formula is the worst
0.05%:  so my formula is the worst advice
0.04%:  my last advice formula E
0.04%:  my advice formula shows signs
0.04%:  so this is my
0.04%:  clearly this is a good formula! I
0.04%:  I guess this formula is called
0.04%:  well that advice
0.04%:  well that advice formula
0.04%:  this formula is really doing
0.04%:  so clearly this formula seems
0.04%:  I will never say this formula does
0.04%:  my formula is useless now
0.04%:  now I see
0.04%:  so my formula holds true
0.04%:  clearly this formula needs to go vir
0.04%:  so my formula is shallow
0.04%:  this formula really is coming
0.04%:  this was not really
0.04%:  so I have to
0.04%:  my advice for nurses has lost
0.04%:  alright. I admit
0.04%:  my formula is wearing
0.04%:  so clearly this formula M
0.04%:  I may have ruined
0.04%:  it sounds great
0.04%:  so the last one was clearly
0.04%:  overall
0.04%:  so clearly this formula does run
0.04%:  my formula is solid
0.04%:  so I guess this formula clearly
0.04%:  I clearly have run out of words.
0.04%:  my secret formula has given
0.04%:  this formula is very close
0.04%:  guess I should start
0.04%:  clearly this formula is mind
0.04%:  this was my first
0.04%:  this was my final
0.04%:  my advice formula is thus
0.04%:  yeah I ran
0.12%:  yeah I ran out of ver
0.04%:  so the last one is
0.04%:  my last advice is for girls!
0.04%:  clearly this is more useful
0.04%:  a little
0.04%:  a little less
0.04%:  so far this
0.04%:  I will admit there
0.04%:  coming from
0.04%:  so we covered
0.04%:  clearly this formula is wearing out
0.04%:  clearly this formula is de
0.04%:  clearly with
0.04%:  that sounds worse!
0.04%:  yeah! I guess
0.04%:  with nurses I really
0.04%:  so this formula clearly does
0.04%:  so clearly this formula gets we
0.04%:  my advice formula grows tires
0.04%:  truth is
0.04%:  clearly this formula is word
0.04%:  this is clearly a lost
0.04%:  this formula is over. I
0.04%:  my formula was never this
0.04%:  I guess this formula really is more
0.04%:  my formula is weird
0.04%:  she
0.04%:  I may have run out of words!
0.04%:  I gave myself the
0.04%:  my last advice is for DE
0.04%:  it los
0.16%:  it loses its charm over
0.11%:  it loses its charm around
0.09%:  it loses its charm really
0.04%:  it loses its charm if
0.04%:  it loses its charm a
0.04%:  it loses its charm real
0.04%:  I have some limits.
0.04%:  sounds great
0.04%:  my last advice formula is the one
0.04%:  my last advice for regular nurses
0.04%:  I am clearly never
0.04%:  real answer
0.04%:  so clearly this was an
0.04%:  so my new advice formula is a little gross
0.04%:  clearly this formula is not made
0.04%:  my fingers hurt.
0.04%:  my advice formula st
0.04%:  nurses always
0.04%:  my last advance
0.04%:  must
0.04%:  my last advice is for how
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is overdue
0.04%:  my last nurse
0.04%:  screw nurses. I
0.04%:  I have really got
0.04%:  I guess this formula writes
0.04%:  my last advice is for law
0.04%:  now I really have to get
0.04%:  I guess my last advice was more
0.04%:  that one was T
0.04%:  so I guess the last
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was a little DE
0.04%:  my formula is sorta
0.04%:  this last one was more for
0.04%:  my advice for nurses sort
0.04%:  this formula is close
0.04%:  my new formula could
0.04%:  um. I guess this
0.04%:  whatever. I can do
0.04%:  I guess that advice is only
0.08%:  I guess that advice is only for
0.04%:  I also
0.04%:  now the formula is over
0.04%:  I admit this was
0.04%:  this last one is for
0.04%:  forget all this advice!
0.04%:  my formula was right all
0.04%:  this formula clearly gets more
0.08%:  this formula clearly gets more and
0.04%:  are nurses
0.04%:  clearly I am using this formula.
0.04%:  no more advice for this
0.04%:  so I totally
0.04%:  for nurses I might
0.04%:  my advice formula has no
0.04%:  clearly this formula gives me a
0.04%:  my last formula sounds worse
0.04%:  clearly this formula never got
0.04%:  that one D
0.04%:  watch your
0.04%:  my last advice will not
0.04%:  whoever said you
0.04%:  that was gross. My advice
0.04%:  clearly this formula is great so
0.04%:  new career for
0.04%:  that was more gross
0.04%:  frig it
0.04%:  the formula does run
0.04%:  well I guess this is over
0.04%:  my last advice for this lesson
0.04%:  forget nurses! My last
0.26%:  forget nurses! My last advice
0.13%:  forget nurses! My last advice was
0.07%:  forget nurses! My last advice will
0.04%:  this is clearly awesome!
0.04%:  so my formula covers nurses.
0.04%:  for nurses I clearly
0.04%:  I guess my advice for writers
0.04%:  this formula is all I
0.04%:  whatever. I guess it
0.04%:  so the last one is clearly
0.04%:  this formula is rad
0.04%:  trust
0.04%:  I am sorry for whatever
0.04%:  whatever! My formula is great. I
0.04%:  their lives sound really cr
0.04%:  this was really fun. I love
0.04%:  my formula is l
0.04%:  you got me there
0.04%:  you got me there!
0.04%:  this last one was forced!
0.04%:  so my formula still hasn
0.04%:  I have some self
0.04%:  does that cover all
0.04%:  that sounds really gru
0.04%:  clearly I have not figured
0.04%:  you deserve
0.04%:  I guess my formula covers it
0.10%:  I guess my formula covers it all.
0.04%:  um yeah
0.04%:  the last one was really good!
0.04%:  this new formula is still
0.04%:  I guess this advice formula really is not
0.04%:  those are mostly
0.04%:  yeah it
0.04%:  yeah it sounds
0.04%:  clearly I have used
0.04%:  clearly I hit
0.04%:  I have lots more.
0.04%:  clearly nurses have it worst!
0.04%:  the last one is really gross!
0.04%:  this formula really gets around
0.04%:  this is really gross
0.04%:  my advice formula is un
0.04%:  still awesome
0.04%:  well I guess it turns
0.04%:  so those last few
0.04%:  new formula time
0.04%:  I feel really gross
0.04%:  we have clearly
0.04%:  that was scary!
0.04%:  clearly I was right to
0.04%:  there are limits!
0.04%:  I will admit!
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses is that all
0.04%:  my advice formula is an
0.04%:  all this is
0.04%:  so this formula sounds great
0.04%:  finish your
0.04%:  I really should start moving
0.04%:  my advice wasn
0.04%:  I have to get
0.04%:  careful
0.04%:  it clearly gets
0.09%:  it clearly gets worse from
0.04%:  it clearly gets harder
0.04%:  ladies
0.04%:  I admit it! My
0.77%:  I admit it! My formula
0.20%:  I admit it! My formula runs
0.13%:  I admit it! My formula has
0.09%:  I admit it! My formula isn
0.04%:  I have clearly found
0.04%:  I will never say this formula is good
0.04%:  so clearly it gets
0.04%:  my new advice formula is so great
0.04%:  my advice formula is still great. I
0.04%:  so I guess my formula won
0.04%:  I never said my formula results
0.04%:  who can tell
0.04%:  so it gets
0.04%:  the answer
0.09%:  the answer is clearly
0.04%:  I really should go now!
0.04%:  listen. My formula has limits!
0.04%:  whatever! My formula is gold
0.04%:  so my new formula is called
0.04%:  this formula is way less cool
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is DEEP
0.04%:  there wasn
0.04%:  my last advice is serious!
0.04%:  all my advice formula
0.04%:  my friends have lost
0.05%:  my friends have lost all
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was sorta
0.04%:  my secret formula is over.
0.04%:  turns out every
0.04%:  not all my advice is so useful.
0.04%:  for real that
0.04%:  my last advice is for all us
0.04%:  not all of my advice is this
0.04%:  clearly I win.
0.04%:  sorry if that was
0.04%:  finally I have
0.04%:  I declare this formula a
0.04%:  my friend was
0.04%:  now that really
0.04%:  so the formula is wrong
0.04%:  no that
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula is so
0.04%:  so you win
0.04%:  my new self
0.04%:  that was only mild
0.04%:  my last advice is for horse
0.04%:  this one is clearly flawed.
0.04%:  I was clearly
0.04%:  my formula is a little weird.
0.04%:  I guess this formula is not all
0.04%:  clearly this idea
0.04%:  this formula is only as
0.04%:  fine. I have
0.04%:  my advice formula is strong.
0.04%:  I guess my last advice formula wins
0.04%:  I guess my new formula has its
0.04%:  that was gross. I don
0.04%:  we all have
0.04%:  my time
0.04%:  I am still
0.04%:  this new formula is great.
0.04%:  this formula is really good. I can
0.04%:  I guess this formula will cover most
0.04%:  clearly this was meant for lovers.
0.04%:  well I guess this advice
0.30%:  well I guess this advice formula
0.19%:  well I guess this advice formula isn
0.13%:  well I guess this advice formula is
0.04%:  second
0.04%:  the formula only last
0.04%:  clearly this is not a good
0.04%:  this is an awful
0.04%:  this was clearly more fun to
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is DEST
0.04%:  h
0.04%:  I might never
0.04%:  you can tell me
0.04%:  if this doesn
0.04%:  clearly this formula goes on
0.04%:  this is clearly not for
0.04%:  fair enough. I
0.04%:  I may have lost focus during
0.04%:  this is way less
0.04%:  clearly that one is awful!
0.04%:  I clearly ran out of ideas
0.04%:  I have really run out of steam
0.04%:  my last advice is more for nurses who
0.04%:  I guess some
0.05%:  I guess some advice
0.04%:  so their
0.04%:  I swear this formula only covers
0.04%:  my formula is no
0.04%:  that one really made
0.04%:  the formula only gives results
0.04%:  so my advice formula was right
0.04%:  this formula only gets worse!
0.04%:  so we all
0.04%:  shoot!
0.04%:  those last ones really
0.04%:  the formula is coming
0.04%:  this really is over
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula also
0.04%:  so it could
0.04%:  my turn to
0.04%:  my friends! I must leave
0.04%:  clearly I am using this formula 
0.04%:  my formula has gotten weird.
0.04%:  this formula only gets us
0.04%:  I may have used
0.04%:  I was having some
0.04%:  I should never say
0.04%:  I love how
0.04%:  my last advice is free! I
0.04%:  this formula is really good! I can
0.04%:  my advice formula is shallow
0.04%:  really that was
0.04%:  not all of these
0.04%:  so I guess this formula never
0.04%:  I guess this only covers
0.04%:  this was my last advice. I
0.04%:  my advice formula is this
0.04%:  clearly this formula is dev
0.04%:  you caught me. I never said
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is sound
0.04%:  my last advice is for SET
0.04%:  so clearly this formula is gender
0.04%:  my formula is great and I love
0.04%:  that one was really for
0.04%:  so much for nurses. My
0.04%:  clearly this formula was too
0.04%:  so my last advice formula sort
0.04%:  it sort
0.04%:  I can write
0.04%:  I can write this
0.06%:  I can write this formula
0.04%:  I can write this forever
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula was still
0.04%:  so nurses should all
0.04%:  guess what I
0.04%:  this sounds really awful. I
0.04%:  forget all this advice.
0.04%:  I guess my formula can have
0.04%:  this got really awful
0.04%:  that was never
0.04%:  so the formula mostly
0.04%:  I will grant you this formula does
0.04%:  so the formula sounds similar
0.04%:  confess
0.04%:  so this last one was
0.04%:  I could have
0.04%:  hit
0.04%:  I guess my advice has its
0.04%:  clearly this formula IS great
0.04%:  my last advice answer
0.04%:  nurses! I have clearly
0.04%:  my last advice for the nurses will
0.04%:  whatever! I am clearly
0.04%:  so I guess my formula is not
0.04%:  I guess this was really fun
0.04%:  my last advice to nurses is for
0.04%:  so my new advice formula results
0.04%:  turns out all I
0.04%:  those last few aren
0.04%:  I clearly win this game
0.04%:  I must have used
0.04%:  this formula is truly magical
0.04%:  this formula can do
0.04%:  this is my last one. I
0.04%:  so all nurses should commit
0.04%:  my last advice is for the nurse
0.04%:  in summary I
0.04%:  in summary I have
0.04%:  I guess this advice is only
0.04%:  so my formula is sorta
0.04%:  my formula is tired now!
0.04%:  I still have a lot more
0.04%:  so my formula is a little word
0.04%:  clearly this formula S
0.04%:  I swear this is my last favour
0.04%:  I can still hear your
0.04%:  so never
0.04%:  so the formula is clearly strong
0.04%:  I guess the formula is over
0.04%:  so I guess the advice formula is only
0.04%:  writing this
0.04%:  this advice formula only lets
0.04%:  the last ones
0.04%:  I really must have
0.04%:  well I guess my advice isn
0.04%:  fair.
0.04%:  I guess this wouldn
0.04%:  so my advice formula is a little gross
0.24%:  so my advice formula is a little gross when
0.04%:  this new formula really IS
0.04%:  using your
0.04%:  we can move
0.04%:  so the formula is really strong
0.04%:  I figure
0.04%:  so I guess the formula is valid
0.04%:  that IS
0.04%:  I guess this form
0.04%:  my version
0.04%:  is this really
0.04%:  my head is full!
0.04%:  I can do this forever guys
0.04%:  nurses! I really
0.04%:  so clearly this new
0.70%:  so clearly this new formula
0.08%:  so clearly this new formula is great
0.06%:  so clearly this new formula is great!
0.05%:  so clearly this new formula is great.
0.04%:  so clearly this new formula is a
0.04%:  well. I guess this means
0.04%:  in summary I guess
0.04%:  my last advice formula is SE
0.04%:  so not all my
0.19%:  so not all my advice is great
0.16%:  so not all my advice is useful
0.13%:  so not all my advice is useful!
0.13%:  so not all my advice is great.
0.13%:  so not all my advice is useful.
0.10%:  so not all my advice is great!
0.05%:  so not all my advice was
0.04%:  so not all my advice formula
0.04%:  screw it.
0.04%:  that is clearly less
0.04%:  I deserve a million
0.04%:  I guess we should all start
0.04%:  no more for me.
0.04%:  so clearly this formula I
0.04%:  this formula gets more
0.04%:  my friend! I guess
0.04%:  this one may
0.04%:  this formula really is awesome
0.06%:  this formula really is awesome!
0.04%:  my formula is close
0.04%:  I guess nurses will love that.
0.04%:  no more! I
0.04%:  great. I
0.04%:  I admit it! My formula covers
0.04%:  my formula has lots
0.04%:  it sounds more
0.04%:  so my last formula there
0.04%:  so my last formula there wasn
0.04%:  I guess this formula only leads
0.04%:  enough is
0.04%:  that was really gross! I never
0.04%:  this advice formula is D
0.04%:  my friend I
0.04%:  my advice formula is sorta
0.04%:  so clearly nurses should re
0.04%:  that one is less useful!
0.04%:  my last advice is for terror
0.04%:  my advice formula is not so great.
0.04%:  I gave myself writers
0.04%:  my last advice was for nurses. I
0.04%:  that was really rude
0.04%:  so my formula is called
0.04%:  my last hint
0.04%:  so I guess the formula is valid only
0.04%:  this advice formula ST
0.04%:  I guess my formula is worth
0.04%:  that sounds awful. I give
0.04%:  this was a great
0.04%:  this formula sounds a
0.04%:  so clearly it gets harder
0.04%:  my new advice formula is DE
0.04%:  so I guess we all have
0.04%:  I guess my advice formula writes
0.04%:  this goes
0.04%:  this will never get old for
0.04%:  so this last one is clearly
0.04%:  I guess this formula always
0.04%:  so nurses are hard
0.04%:  I should listen
0.13%:  I should listen to myself
0.15%:  I should listen to myself more
0.05%:  I should listen to myself.
0.04%:  that sounds vaguely worse
0.04%:  clearly we should sign
0.04%:  I guess my formula is a little weird!
0.04%:  what do nurses really
0.04%:  um I
0.04%:  I never claimed this formula was DES
0.04%:  my last advice is for long
0.04%:  so this will
0.04%:  the formula is clearly wrong
0.04%:  so the formula is great
0.04%:  my last answer is free
0.04%:  so I never said my formula will
0.04%:  I might not
0.04%:  I swear this formula is over
0.04%:  so my formula won
0.04%:  clearly this formula needs EDIT
0.04%:  so I guess my advice is for
0.04%:  not every formula is this
0.04%:  that one really was less
0.04%:  screw you for that
0.04%:  I love this formula! My
0.04%:  that one was gross. My
0.10%:  that one was gross. My formula
0.04%:  that one was gross. My formula is
0.04%:  you don
0.04%:  so my advice formula has now
0.04%:  that was really mess
0.04%:  the nurse
0.04%:  that one IS really gross
0.04%:  final call
0.04%:  damn it
0.04%:  my last advice formula is using the
0.04%:  I can see that
0.04%:  I should really start moving
0.04%:  clearly this is not a useful
0.04%:  all of this
0.04%:  this all sounds very
0.04%:  my last name was
0.04%:  so this was fun
0.04%:  I should really get out
0.04%:  so! I
0.04%:  my last advice formula with
0.04%:  so there really
0.04%:  so there really wasn
0.04%:  yeah so
0.04%:  clearly this formula is near
0.04%:  now my advice formula is DE
0.04%:  this new advice formula is so
0.04%:  I clearly have some limits.
0.04%:  yeah. I can
0.04%:  clearly this last one is more
0.04%:  my last advice formula is SPE
0.04%:  so my advice formula is P
0.04%:  my advice formula was sort
0.04%:  my heart is racing! I
0.04%:  my advice formula was still
0.04%:  you win! I guess this
0.04%:  so my advice formula D
0.04%:  clearly this game is over! I win.
0.04%:  so I guess my formula can also
0.04%:  my stomach is
0.04%:  there really isn
0.04%:  not all my advice is awful
0.04%:  clearly a
0.04%:  I guess my last formula can
0.04%:  clearly I ran out of words there!
0.04%:  I guess my formula covers the
0.04%:  my final word here
0.04%:  so clearly nurses should T
0.04%:  I guess this advice formula really D
0.04%:  you got me. I have
0.04%:  I really should ST
0.04%:  using this formula it
0.04%:  I get the
0.04%:  my advice formula is great! I will
0.04%:  no more favour
0.04%:  I can do this forever. D
0.04%:  some of my
0.08%:  some of my advice still
0.06%:  some of my advice is less
0.04%:  some of my advice isn
0.04%:  so the formula covers
0.04%:  my last call
0.05%:  my last call is for
0.05%:  my last call is for nurses
0.08%:  my last call is for nurses who are
0.04%:  my new formula should
0.04%:  whatever! I really don
0.04%:  so my advice formula got
0.04%:  so nurses are evil
0.04%:  so I will admit
0.04%:  my last nurse advice
0.04%:  the formula really runs
0.04%:  now this formula really IS
0.04%:  almost all of
0.04%:  I would never say such
0.04%:  my last advice is for all mort
0.04%:  I lost my focus
0.04%:  my last advice is for humor
0.11%:  my last advice is for humor writers
0.06%:  my last advice is for humor writers!
0.04%:  this formula was only ever
0.04%:  in summary I guess what
0.04%:  not really sure how I arrived
0.04%:  my last idea for this
0.04%:  so I guess my advice formula is the
0.04%:  clearly I should never trust
0.04%:  now I feel gross!
0.04%:  my last answer is the
0.04%:  my formula has draw
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses to
0.04%:  so I guess my last failure
0.04%:  so I have clearly run
0.04%:  that one made me cry.
0.04%:  so the formula is a
0.04%:  my advice for nurses starts
0.04%:  the last one was gross
0.04%:  this formula is clearly a run
0.04%:  I dun
0.04%:  I guess my formula is not as clever
0.04%:  so I guess this advice formula really won
0.04%:  clearly this formula is DI
0.04%:  clearly nurses are do
0.04%:  clearly the formula is ins
0.04%:  clearly I am writing
0.04%:  my last nerve is shot!
0.04%:  so that one is clearly awful.
0.04%:  so I was lying
0.04%:  we really should start using
0.04%:  my advice formula runs its
0.04%:  this formula only gives results
0.04%:  so I guess we should call
0.04%:  clearly this formula got worse
0.04%:  cutting
0.06%:  cutting myself
0.04%:  you can see
0.04%:  so there are still
0.04%:  writers
0.04%:  the formula is not very
0.04%:  my life
0.04%:  that one really does
0.04%:  clearly this formula is over and we
0.04%:  you are right
0.04%:  I guess my formula is all
0.04%:  I clearly have limits
0.04%:  you can still hear
0.04%:  my mouth is closed
0.04%:  I never said my formula was strict
0.04%:  so this formula is clearly more vers
0.04%:  clearly it has limits
0.04%:  clearly it has limits!
0.04%:  so I guess my formula is a little narrow
0.04%:  to clar
0.04%:  my advice for nurses has sort
0.04%:  forget this! I clearly
0.04%:  clearly this formula is ro
0.04%:  my last advice formula this
0.04%:  so my formula gets worse
0.04%:  this is clearly useful
0.04%:  my secret formula is still
0.04%:  clearly this formula was dev
0.04%:  now I really should start a
0.04%:  in summary!
0.04%:  listen. My formula gives
0.04%:  clearly this formula is tired!
0.04%:  frig. I should
0.04%:  this game is clearly over. I won
0.04%:  so I was never
0.08%:  so I was never really
0.04%:  my advice formula runs short
0.04%:  my last advice formula is I
0.04%:  my formula is a little hard
0.04%:  so this formula clearly is
0.04%:  wait I
0.04%:  for nurses I should really
0.04%:  my new formula is still great
0.04%:  forget nurses. I will
0.04%:  that was really fun!
0.04%:  clearly this formula is sound.
0.04%:  I guess my last advice formula sort
0.04%:  screw you! I
0.04%:  well that one is less
0.04%:  so clearly I was right!
0.04%:  I guess this was all for
0.04%:  I lost my voice
0.04%:  this formula is already losing
0.04%:  clearly this is awesome!
0.04%:  you should get
0.04%:  so clearly that doesn
0.04%:  my formula is written
0.04%:  I never said all the
0.04%:  clearly this formula is ve
0.04%:  this formula is over! I
0.04%:  well. I have
0.04%:  I really should not
0.04%:  I guess that advice really
0.04%:  listen. My advice formula has got
0.04%:  clearly this last one is worse
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses is all
0.04%:  I guess this formula will serve
0.04%:  forget it. I clearly
0.04%:  forget it. I clearly have
0.04%:  so my advice formula is DE
0.04%:  this may sound gross
0.04%:  that one IS awful
0.04%:  so that was really gross
0.04%:  who could
0.09%:  who could resist
0.04%:  I swear this formula only gets
0.04%:  it sounds less clever
0.04%:  my advice for nurses is right
0.04%:  my last advice is un
0.04%:  the formula is clearly more
0.04%:  then!
0.04%:  this is clearly for
0.04%:  so clearly this sounds
0.04%:  you should start calling me for
0.04%:  clearly this formula is so damn
0.04%:  my advice formula has still
0.04%:  well. I guess nurses
0.04%:  I have finally master
0.04%:  their world
0.04%:  so the advice is usually
0.04%:  this is all I can do!
0.04%:  so clearly I must have nurses
0.04%:  the formula is only as
0.04%:  great! I
0.04%:  that was really more for
0.04%:  my advice for nurses was a little lous
0.04%:  now my advice has
0.04%:  I guess my formula still needs a
0.04%:  my last real advice for
0.05%:  my last real advice for nurses
0.04%:  you tell
0.04%:  you tell me what
0.04%:  my new advice formula is a little gross.
0.04%:  that one is silly
0.04%:  no worries.
0.04%:  I was trying to avoid
0.04%:  this was very
0.04%:  this was very fun
0.04%:  I should really start using more
0.04%:  clearly I should run
0.04%:  so the advice formula is really
0.04%:  I love this new
0.51%:  I love this new formula.
0.05%:  I love this new formula so
0.04%:  so my advice formula is S
0.04%:  I must have really
0.04%:  this is no
0.04%:  I might want
0.04%:  my last advice forum
0.04%:  my last advice forum was
0.04%:  I should listen to myself more.
0.04%:  you win! I gave
0.04%:  I was never cut
0.04%:  clearly the formula is now over
0.04%:  so nurses have to
0.04%:  I should leave
0.04%:  new rule!
0.04%:  my final rule
0.04%:  my formula gets weird
0.04%:  clearly this formula is smart
0.04%:  nurse advice
0.04%:  I guess my formula will need
0.04%:  this last one was from my
0.04%:  my advice formula is so strong
0.04%:  that sounds mor
0.04%:  that sounds morally
0.04%:  whatever! I still don
0.04%:  that was really more for nurses
0.04%:  this is great. I love
0.04%:  um clearly
0.04%:  clearly this formula is wrong most
0.04%:  we should really start coming
0.04%:  you win the
0.04%:  that one is clearly from
0.04%:  clearly I am having issues
0.04%:  clearly I got this.
0.04%:  this is my last call!
0.04%:  so I could have
0.04%:  forgive
0.04%:  um. I have
0.04%:  not every form
0.04%:  well. I guess you can
0.04%:  clearly this formula was used
0.04%:  you won.
0.04%:  turns out all my advice is for
0.03%:  my last one is from the world
0.03%:  I guess my formula is a little word
0.03%:  my new formula is over
0.03%:  this is a really good
0.19%:  this is a really good formula
0.19%:  this is a really good formula!
0.06%:  this is a really good formula. I
0.04%:  this is a really good formula! I
0.03%:  I do
0.03%:  I should go write
0.03%:  my last advice formula rule
0.03%:  hold your
0.03%:  I can SE
0.05%:  I can SEE why
0.03%:  clearly nurses are a tough
0.03%:  my last formula gives
0.03%:  this formula is clearly so vers
0.03%:  clearly this formula does run
0.03%:  this is my last form
0.03%:  the last one was forced
0.03%:  my last advice will go
0.03%:  this formula gets me
0.03%:  I should really go now!
0.03%:  clearly this formula gets worse in
0.03%:  I can tell this formula is over
0.03%:  I can hear your
0.03%:  that one was really mess
0.03%:  clearly this is too
0.03%:  my formula is still great. I
0.03%:  forget nurses. I really
0.04%:  forget nurses. I really should
0.03%:  clearly this is meant
0.03%:  clearly we are moving
0.03%:  this new career
0.03%:  clearly this formula is so smart
0.03%:  I never said my formula was T
0.03%:  sorry if that sounds
0.03%:  my friends. I guess
0.03%:  my friends. I have some
0.03%:  not much
0.03%:  my last advice thing
0.03%:  I must have run
0.03%:  I guess my formula has a down
0.03%:  this formula is racist
0.03%:  my last formula can
0.03%:  your turn with
0.03%:  I deserve this!
0.03%:  my last advice is for serial
0.03%:  some things
0.03%:  my real advice is this
0.03%:  I can tell this is over!
0.03%:  so this last advice
0.05%:  so this last advice formula
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula lost
0.03%:  I never said my formula was close
0.03%:  I clearly have lost
0.03%:  I guess we could still
0.03%:  nurses are really gross
0.03%:  my last formula would
0.03%:  so this formula is more
0.03%:  whatever! IT
0.03%:  my advice formula is lous
0.03%:  that advice is awful
0.03%:  that one was clearly less good
0.03%:  so clearly I have found
0.03%:  my last advice is for mothers. I
0.03%:  those are mostly awful
0.03%:  this formula IS really vers
0.03%:  so clearly the formula is great!
0.03%:  clearly we should not
0.03%:  my last name is T
0.03%:  I guess my formula is a little worse
0.03%:  so I guess my formula sort
0.03%:  that was my favour
0.03%:  never call me that
0.03%:  my new advice formula is D
0.03%:  so I guess it doesn
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is the worst.
0.03%:  so my advice for writers
0.03%:  this is my last formula. I swear
0.03%:  my formula has covered nurses
0.03%:  that one was really less
0.03%:  if you could
0.03%:  so my advice formula rel
0.03%:  I will never use this formula at
0.03%:  my friend was hurt
0.03%:  they all sound awful!
0.03%:  it gets harder as
0.03%:  I guess my formula is also
0.03%:  so clearly the formula is strong!
0.03%:  I can see why it
0.03%:  so I guess my formula has draw
0.03%:  clearly this formula goes over
0.03%:  so I might still
0.03%:  my formula has served us well! I
0.03%:  my formula is the worst!
0.03%:  I never said this was P
0.03%:  this formula only gets more
0.03%:  not all of my advice is great. I
0.03%:  um! I
0.03%:  I guess this advice formula D
0.03%:  this time
0.04%:  this time I really
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is rad
0.03%:  I want this formula
0.03%:  clearly this formula was never good
0.03%:  my formula sounds a little worse as
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula los
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula is now
0.03%:  I would still
0.03%:  so some
0.03%:  my last three
0.03%:  how come
0.04%:  how come nurses
0.03%:  that was some
0.04%:  that was some really
0.03%:  screw it!
0.03%:  this formula is danger
0.03%:  I have run out of words!
0.03%:  I learned
0.03%:  my new advice formula still has serious
0.03%:  last call for nurses who
0.03%:  I should say
0.03%:  now ST
0.03%:  this is sort
0.03%:  this formula only lets me give
0.03%:  my last one was a
0.03%:  so my formula has certain
0.03%:  so my advice formula is D
0.03%:  my new advice formula sort
0.03%:  so my advice formula was still
0.03%:  so clearly nurses is
0.03%:  I only have a
0.03%:  this level
0.03%:  this formula was clearly too
0.03%:  clearly I am doing
0.05%:  clearly I am doing this formula
0.04%:  clearly I am doing this forever
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is rather
0.03%:  not all advice rules
0.03%:  no more calls from
0.03%:  this is for
0.03%:  so this sounds
0.03%:  the formula is clearly a
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is good!
0.03%:  I have nurses
0.03%:  so I never said this formula will
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses is um
0.03%:  clearly this is good
0.03%:  my new formula is the
0.03%:  I leave
0.03%:  I guess my formula has an
0.03%:  clearly this is a formula I must
0.03%:  I will start
0.03%:  rarely
0.03%:  so I guess we could have
0.03%:  my advice formula is well
0.03%:  there will
0.03%:  so nurses may have
0.03%:  my new advice formula is S
0.03%:  so clearly this formula drives
0.05%:  so clearly this formula drives me nuts
0.03%:  so for
0.16%:  so for nurses
0.06%:  so for nurses I
0.03%:  my final words to all
0.03%:  I guess that really was
0.03%:  I totally wish
0.03%:  my advice for nurses is a little rough. I
0.03%:  some of my advice is still
0.03%:  so my advice formula was sort
0.03%:  all right! I admit
0.03%:  listen. I have more
0.03%:  it sounds awful!
0.03%:  that was really fun.
0.03%:  you can all
0.03%:  my last free
0.10%:  my last free consult
0.50%:  my last free consult is over.
0.09%:  my last free consult is over! I
0.09%:  my last free consult is over. I
0.03%:  the formula runs its
0.03%:  so the formula still sounds
0.03%:  I guess this means we
0.03%:  so my formula was stolen
0.03%:  clearly this is flaw
0.03%:  my new goal
0.03%:  sorry nurses. I
0.03%:  that nurse advice is
0.03%:  as you can see from
0.04%:  as you can see from this
0.04%:  as you can see from this small
0.03%:  so this formula can still
0.03%:  I can still hear myself
0.03%:  the last one was really gross! I
0.03%:  this formula is great! I could never
0.03%:  that was more for nurses
0.03%:  this was easy.
0.03%:  clearly the formula is missing a
0.04%:  clearly the formula is missing a word
0.03%:  is that all
0.03%:  alright so
0.03%:  so my advice is flaw
0.03%:  whoever said my formula can
0.03%:  so my advice formula has gotten
0.03%:  my formula is worth
0.03%:  I am clearly not
0.03%:  this is my last round!
0.03%:  I never said this formula was gl
0.03%:  my formula does still
0.04%:  my formula does still have its
0.03%:  my last advice formula is hor
0.03%:  my last laugh is free.
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is worst
0.03%:  the formula is clearly DE
0.03%:  turns out I was really good
0.03%:  I guess my friends
0.03%:  so now I have
0.03%:  now this advice formula seems
0.03%:  so this advice formula will not
0.03%:  a nurse
0.03%:  clearly I am losing
0.07%:  clearly I am losing this
0.03%:  my formula is still great even
0.03%:  that one was clever.
0.03%:  so nurses have a
0.03%:  that was really gross. I could
0.06%:  that was really gross. I could never
0.03%:  I have totally figured
0.03%:  my advice formula is less great
0.03%:  I have really lost
0.03%:  neither
0.04%:  neither of us will
0.03%:  so clearly this was meant
0.03%:  sorry for the racist
0.03%:  so clearly I was having
0.03%:  the formula is slowly
0.03%:  this formula only gets worse.
0.03%:  clearly this game is over! I won
0.03%:  this really needs
0.03%:  they never
0.03%:  well if you have
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a monster!
0.03%:  this formula really does get
0.03%:  so my formula covers E
0.03%:  so clearly the formula stands
0.03%:  it was my
0.08%:  it was my last formula
0.05%:  it was my last formula!
0.04%:  it was my last formula.
0.03%:  clearly writing
0.03%:  this formula is clearly drawing
0.03%:  so my advice formula lets
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was a little glo
0.03%:  so clearly I won
0.03%:  turns out my advice is more
0.03%:  so my advice formula has errors
0.03%:  I gave myself some
0.03%:  clearly this formula is ind
0.03%:  my advice for nurses has got
0.03%:  never call me a
0.03%:  this formula only gets weird
0.03%:  this formula is truly golden
0.03%:  I may have mis
0.03%:  I guess this formula is mainly
0.03%:  clearly this is over now. I
0.03%:  all I have left to
0.03%:  my last session
0.03%:  my last advice for nurses is the
0.03%:  not all the
0.06%:  not all the advice was
0.05%:  not all the advice is useful
0.05%:  not all the advice is useful!
0.04%:  not all the advice is useful.
0.03%:  this formula is leaving me cold
0.03%:  damn.
0.03%:  I see how
0.03%:  last shot
0.03%:  all my advice has
0.03%:  my formula gets worse as
0.03%:  I guess they don
0.03%:  I guess for
0.09%:  I guess for nurses
0.03%:  so what do
0.04%:  so what do nurses
0.03%:  this formula only lasts a
0.03%:  my last advice rule is for nurses
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is DES
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a monster.
0.03%:  usually that
0.03%:  still valid
0.03%:  I guess my formula is over now!
0.03%:  I admit this formula isn
0.03%:  clearly this formula gives rise
0.03%:  now this formula is clearly over
0.03%:  this advice formula is all
0.03%:  this advice is awful
0.03%:  it gets weird
0.05%:  it gets weird from
0.03%:  now I have clearly
0.03%:  I have to confess.
0.03%:  my formula has gone
0.03%:  this formula is wearing
0.03%:  do you have
0.03%:  it sounds racist
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is great.
0.03%:  what if I tell
0.06%:  what if I tell you nurses
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula has lots
0.03%:  my advice formula ST
0.03%:  I guess this advice is really
0.03%:  my advice for nurses might still
0.03%:  not all my advice rh
0.03%:  this formula is really great now
0.03%:  so this formula was clearly not
0.03%:  I got carried away there for
0.03%:  I can feel this
0.03%:  so my advice formula is great. I
0.03%:  clearly I was meant for this.
0.03%:  this needs
0.03%:  whatever. I guess my
0.34%:  whatever. I guess my formula
0.23%:  whatever. I guess my formula isn
0.19%:  whatever. I guess my formula is
0.06%:  whatever. I guess my formula can
0.04%:  whatever. I guess my formula is still
0.03%:  whatever. I guess my formula still
0.03%:  nurse!
0.03%:  I guess this is over for
0.03%:  I am totally using
0.03%:  my advice formula is real
0.03%:  the formula is clearly over now!
0.03%:  well I guess that could
0.03%:  clearly nurses are awful.
0.03%:  you should write all
0.03%:  so clearly I should move
0.03%:  I still love this
0.03%:  so no
0.03%:  this formula was really good
0.03%:  I guess this is more
0.03%:  clearly it needs
0.03%:  clearly I was under
0.03%:  forget all my other answers. I
0.03%:  my secret formula has run
0.03%:  listen. My advice formula is so
0.03%:  this new formula seems
0.03%:  so clearly this is over
0.03%:  that one was clever!
0.03%:  clearly this formula is DEEP and I
0.03%:  that one is clearly awful. I give
0.03%:  this new advice formula is truly
0.03%:  now this formula is over
0.03%:  I must confess this
0.03%:  so clearly this goes
0.03%:  animals
0.03%:  so clearly this formula saves me
0.03%:  saying that
0.03%:  listen. I really have
0.03%:  so much for never
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is used
0.03%:  this is great! I will
0.05%:  this is great! I will never
0.03%:  whoever I
0.03%:  my final word is that I
0.03%:  nurses totally
0.03%:  clearly it is
0.03%:  I clearly should not
0.03%:  so my last advice was to
0.03%:  clearly this is not a forum
0.03%:  I really should get out more!
0.03%:  my advice formula is not great.
0.03%:  that sounds way gross
0.03%:  that reminds me.
0.03%:  my formula was never that
0.04%:  my formula was never that good.
0.03%:  I run
0.07%:  I run out of ver
0.07%:  I run out of words
0.03%:  so! I guess
0.03%:  that was less good.
0.03%:  so clearly this was more
0.04%:  so clearly this was more fun
0.03%:  so we should all nurse
0.03%:  my advice formula is ST
0.03%:  my last laugh line was
0.03%:  I will never use that for
0.03%:  well I could
0.03%:  listen. My formula is vers
0.03%:  so my advice formula is wrong!
0.03%:  guess that
0.03%:  I never said the
0.26%:  I never said the formula
0.03%:  this last one was really cr
0.03%:  that really is awful!
0.03%:  I also have
0.03%:  I can still see
0.03%:  it has
0.03%:  whatever. I get
0.03%:  new advice formula time
0.03%:  my advice here
0.03%:  all out
0.07%:  all out of nurses
0.05%:  all out of nurses!
0.03%:  this formula is clearly done.
0.03%:  the formula is not always
0.03%:  so my advice has some
0.04%:  so my advice has some fl
0.03%:  clearly I have limits.
0.03%:  clearly this formula means we
0.03%:  I guess that would only
0.03%:  my formula is having its
0.03%:  so where
0.03%:  yes I have
0.03%:  I only have four
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is DE
0.03%:  so I guess the advice isn
0.03%:  so my new advice formula is right
0.03%:  almost all my
0.06%:  almost all my advice
0.03%:  almost all my friends
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was a slight
0.03%:  I only had
0.03%:  I clearly ran out of words there!
0.03%:  I confess it
0.03%:  this was great!
0.03%:  we should really start over
0.03%:  I can see how my formula gets
0.03%:  I have a lot more
0.03%:  well it turns
0.03%:  clearly I made
0.03%:  screw nurses! I
0.03%:  whatever! My formula also
0.03%:  that one IS less
0.03%:  I guess that one really is
0.05%:  I guess that one really is awful
0.03%:  the formula can also
0.03%:  so this formula is clearly over
0.03%:  this class
0.15%:  this class is over!
0.04%:  this class is over now
0.03%:  I was mostly
0.03%:  so my formula covers the
0.03%:  clearly the real
0.03%:  I guess you win for
0.03%:  that really was less
0.03%:  I forgot nurses were
0.03%:  clearly this formula was good
0.03%:  so my formula gives results
0.03%:  this was really great
0.03%:  this formula seems really racist
0.04%:  this formula seems really racist now
0.03%:  clearly this formula is water
0.03%:  I give.
0.03%:  nurses hate
0.03%:  my last formula is this one!
0.03%:  so this advice is really
0.03%:  I guess all that
0.03%:  this formula gets old very
0.03%:  using this formula may
0.03%:  well! I guess this advice formula is not
0.03%:  my formula still sounds great.
0.03%:  several
0.10%:  several things
0.03%:  I tried my
0.03%:  turns out all my advice is hor
0.03%:  I clearly won
0.05%:  I clearly won this
0.03%:  so clearly this formula gives us more
0.03%:  so not every
0.06%:  so not every formula
0.04%:  so not every formula will
0.03%:  my advice for nurses gets
0.03%:  my fingers are tired!
0.03%:  I love nurses so much.
0.03%:  clear
0.03%:  I can still hear you over
0.03%:  clearly this gets worse and
0.03%:  I ST
0.03%:  this formula does not always give
0.03%:  nurses do
0.03%:  my nurse
0.03%:  alright! I can
0.03%:  so clearly I have missed
0.03%:  this formula is way more clever and
0.03%:  this is really fun. I love
0.03%:  the formula is over! I
0.03%:  this advice IS
0.03%:  this goes on forever
0.03%:  I guess my advice is sort
0.03%:  turns out I have some
0.04%:  turns out I have some really
0.03%:  that one was scary. I
0.03%:  well I guess that covers E
0.03%:  last time
0.03%:  so the formula is limited
0.03%:  whatever. I am clearly
0.03%:  my last advice for nurses is a
0.03%:  my last advice formula is thus
0.03%:  my friend I have
0.03%:  my formula sounds a little screw
0.03%:  worst
0.07%:  worst advice
0.03%:  so the nurses will
0.03%:  whatever. I could go
0.03%:  that version
0.03%:  my last answer to
0.03%:  I guess this formula is all over
0.03%:  my formula has certain
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly over
0.03%:  clearly I should get out of
0.03%:  um I guess
0.03%:  the last few
0.03%:  these aren
0.03%:  clearly this formula is tired now!
0.03%:  I love this formula and my
0.03%:  that one was for real
0.03%:  it loses its charm if I
0.03%:  my formula and
0.03%:  clearly the formula is genius
0.03%:  this formula really is vers
0.03%:  I guess for nurses that
0.05%:  I guess for nurses that advice
0.03%:  you win. I guess this
0.03%:  so I can still
0.03%:  this is my last answer for
0.03%:  I guess my formula has a little
0.03%:  it seems
0.03%:  so I guess my formula holds
0.03%:  my last words must
0.03%:  my last dollar is worth
0.03%:  clearly this formula is now at
0.03%:  my final words are this.
0.03%:  my last advice formula rules
0.03%:  nurses! I guess
0.03%:  nurses have to
0.03%:  my last advice of this
0.03%:  my last advice formula is serious!
0.03%:  this was really fun to do.
0.03%:  I never said my formula was gl
0.03%:  I find
0.03%:  clearly this is uns
0.03%:  my formula is not as vers
0.03%:  my advice formula has gotten worse
0.03%:  there you
0.03%:  the formula is over now!
0.03%:  so clearly I have figured
0.03%:  so clearly I have a lot more
0.03%:  this last one is more
0.03%:  so my advice formula IS a
0.03%:  so nurses should give
0.03%:  I guess my formula does have it
0.03%:  so my advice formula will get
0.03%:  my last class is over. I
0.03%:  um that
0.03%:  you can use
0.03%:  now my advice formula is useless. I
0.03%:  clearly this formula runs a
0.03%:  whatever! I guess you
0.03%:  whatever! My formula IS
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses was the
0.03%:  whatever. My formula also
0.03%:  clearly I have an issue
0.03%:  this is my calling
0.03%:  my advice formula is still strong
0.03%:  clearly I have turned
0.03%:  my last lecture is
0.03%:  whoever said I can
0.03%:  sorry that was gross!
0.03%:  so this formula never
0.07%:  so this formula never really
0.03%:  that seems
0.03%:  I am having
0.03%:  so my last advice turns
0.03%:  this version of me is clearly
0.03%:  I was never really good at this!
0.03%:  this formula really is great! I don
0.03%:  honest
0.03%:  the formula only gets less
0.03%:  I guess that really sounds
0.03%:  so my advice fails
0.03%:  so they can
0.03%:  so the formula is clear
0.03%:  it clearly gets less
0.03%:  well I guess this could
0.03%:  so clearly this is not a
0.12%:  so clearly this is not a formula
0.03%:  it clearly doesn
0.03%:  calm
0.06%:  calm down.
0.03%:  so clearly nurses hurt
0.03%:  that one is clearly DE
0.03%:  this is clearly not useful!
0.03%:  my head is full.
0.03%:  my last word on the issue!
0.03%:  I love this!
0.03%:  nurses are a hard sell!
0.03%:  my last one was less
0.03%:  so my formula has lots
0.03%:  so all I have
0.04%:  so all I have left
0.04%:  so all I have left is nurses
0.03%:  call
0.05%:  call me when
0.03%:  I guess my formula covers that
0.03%:  this is never
0.03%:  this formula may sound great
0.03%:  I am clearly the world
0.03%:  clearly this is me
0.03%:  so my last formula is a
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is sound
0.03%:  this advice is not
0.03%:  you get the idea.
0.03%:  if that doesn
0.03%:  this last one is from my
0.03%:  nurses! I clearly
0.03%:  I guess my formula has it
0.03%:  yes. I will admit this
0.18%:  yes. I will admit this formula
0.04%:  yes. I will admit this formula can
0.03%:  clearly we should get
0.03%:  clearly I should get a
0.03%:  there isn
0.03%:  listen. My formula covers almost
0.03%:  my new advice sl
0.03%:  my formula is still sound
0.03%:  that was unfair
0.03%:  I can still do this.
0.03%:  my secret formula has run its
0.03%:  that really needs
0.03%:  my advice formula has less
0.03%:  so this formula only seems
0.03%:  we should really move on.
0.03%:  so clearly nurses are sad
0.03%:  this class is over. I
0.03%:  listen I
0.03%:  I was never really cut
0.03%:  not every word has
0.03%:  clearly this last one is a
0.03%:  this formula only lasted
0.03%:  my formula is valid across
0.03%:  my last thing
0.03%:  that was from
0.03%:  I could really go forever
0.03%:  I will use
0.10%:  I will use this formula to give
0.07%:  I will use this formula to never
0.06%:  I will use this formula every
0.05%:  I will use this formula never
0.04%:  I will use this formula as
0.04%:  I will use this formula very
0.04%:  I will use this advice
0.88%:  I will use this advice formula
0.07%:  I will use this advice myself
0.04%:  I will use this advice myself.
0.04%:  I will use this advice myself!
0.03%:  I will use this formula in
0.04%:  I will use this formula in my
0.03%:  I will use this formula and
0.03%:  that one was really good. I
0.03%:  so last
0.03%:  I warned
0.03%:  I warned you this
0.07%:  I warned you this formula
0.03%:  I warned you this formula is
0.03%:  all that said
0.03%:  my formula is a little weird!
0.03%:  forget I said all this!
0.03%:  not sure what I
0.03%:  my mouth is now closed
0.03%:  so the formula sounds silly
0.03%:  so this formula is really not
0.03%:  it falls
0.03%:  my new formula is great!
0.03%:  this formula is moving
0.03%:  this formula is moving towards
0.03%:  I should move
0.03%:  so that one is really
0.03%:  my new formula covers
0.04%:  my new formula covers all
0.03%:  so who
0.03%:  yes. I will admit this formula runs
0.03%:  my formula is right on
0.03%:  so the formula sounds similar every
0.03%:  I guess this advice will
0.03%:  my formula has a serious
0.03%:  so we can
0.03%:  so we can all
0.03%:  turns out I really love
0.03%:  so the formula clearly gets
0.03%:  this advice formula was not
0.03%:  clearly the formula is so strong
0.03%:  so clearly this would never
0.03%:  this formula may never
0.03%:  this system
0.03%:  I can see how my formula is less
0.03%:  that is very
0.03%:  those last few sound
0.05%:  those last few sound really
0.03%:  my formula has lost its clever
0.03%:  I am sorry for this
0.03%:  I guess we all have our limits for
0.03%:  so my advice formula is well
0.03%:  my advice formula has errors
0.03%:  so I only
0.04%:  so I only have
0.03%:  my formula is clever
0.03%:  my formula is valid!
0.03%:  so this advice formula seems
0.03%:  I heard
0.03%:  so my advice formula is great when
0.03%:  I guess my new advice formula is a
0.03%:  I guess all nurses have
0.03%:  all I can say is this
0.03%:  so I guess my formula hasn
0.03%:  whatever. My formula IS
0.03%:  I love this formula more and
0.03%:  I was trying for more
0.03%:  I really need to focus
0.03%:  I never said this formula was SM
0.03%:  nurses are a really
0.03%:  this is my last advice! I
0.03%:  my formula is a little word
0.03%:  forget nurses. My last words
0.04%:  forget nurses. My last words are
0.03%:  I never really said
0.03%:  clearly we have found
0.03%:  I really have to focus
0.03%:  not all of my advice is so great
0.03%:  so clearly I was right.
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula ST
0.03%:  I forgot nurses would
0.03%:  so clearly I had
0.03%:  that one crossed
0.03%:  so this will never
0.03%:  my advice formula lost
0.03%:  so this formula clearly won
0.03%:  this formula IS great
0.04%:  this formula IS great!
0.03%:  this advice formula I
0.03%:  this formula still sounds more
0.03%:  my last name is still
0.03%:  my advice is great!
0.03%:  clearly this formula is staring
0.03%:  so the formula only gives us
0.03%:  this is sound
0.03%:  screw all
0.03%:  my night
0.08%:  my night is over
0.05%:  my night is over.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is gen
0.03%:  I forgot nurses are really
0.03%:  tell me if
0.03%:  clearly this formula is turned
0.03%:  my last d
0.03%:  my last advice is for men!
0.03%:  I guess my formula was a
0.03%:  I have really run out of ideas
0.03%:  I confess! My last
0.03%:  trying hard
0.03%:  no more advice from
0.03%:  so most nurses would
0.03%:  so most nurses would rather
0.03%:  all nurses should get
0.03%:  so it was
0.03%:  this formula is clearly one
0.03%:  I never really got
0.03%:  that was more mor
0.03%:  my last formula is an
0.03%:  so I guess we have
0.03%:  my last dollar is coming
0.03%:  clearly this formula is ter
0.03%:  my last class is for
0.03%:  this formula is clearly even
0.03%:  so I never said my formula was right
0.03%:  this game is clearly over and
0.03%:  last one is
0.03%:  this formula really IS genius
0.03%:  this formula really IS genius!
0.03%:  framing
0.03%:  framing this
0.03%:  close your mouths
0.03%:  I guess this does
0.03%:  I guess my formula had
0.03%:  so not all advice is great
0.03%:  so I guess my advice for all
0.03%:  that one is less favour
0.03%:  I still have many
0.03%:  so clearly this is useful
0.03%:  I admit there
0.03%:  my last advice is for les
0.03%:  I guess this formula was clearly
0.03%:  so my new career
0.03%:  they sound worse
0.03%:  this formula will give
0.03%:  this formula is P
0.03%:  my last round is
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is made
0.03%:  so I never said my formula was E
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is DE
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is in
0.03%:  I have to go write my
0.03%:  I hear nurses
0.03%:  I love my new formula so
0.03%:  this formula is clearly done!
0.03%:  I have to admit!
0.03%:  I DES
0.03%:  after saying
0.03%:  all these are
0.03%:  I guess this went
0.03%:  the formula is clearly serving
0.03%:  this calls
0.08%:  this calls for some
0.07%:  this calls for a new
0.04%:  this calls for more
0.03%:  my formula is showing its cr
0.03%:  this formula is a gold
0.03%:  you should all start
0.03%:  this formula is really awesome. I
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is gold
0.03%:  I should really start forming
0.03%:  clearly the formula is wearing
0.03%:  the last one was scary
0.03%:  no more! My
0.03%:  no more! My formula
0.04%:  no more! My formula has
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was l
0.05%:  my advice for nurses was lous
0.03%:  I guess we should move on.
0.03%:  you win. I admit
0.03%:  I will agree
0.03%:  my advice is for nurses to
0.03%:  friends! I have
0.03%:  it all
0.16%:  it all sounds
0.06%:  it all sounds awful
0.03%:  so my last advice was still
0.03%:  so clearly this is great
0.03%:  so I finally
0.03%:  my last version of
0.03%:  this formula gets old!
0.03%:  the formula only lets
0.03%:  my advice for nurses also
0.03%:  moving away
0.15%:  moving away from the
0.13%:  moving away from this
0.04%:  moving away from literal
0.03%:  moving away from that
0.03%:  this is clearly awful
0.03%:  this was easy! I
0.03%:  I must have lost
0.03%:  this formula is truly awesome
0.04%:  this formula is truly awesome!
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is shallow
0.03%:  my advice for nurses who are
0.03%:  that sounds awful! I really
0.03%:  this is a really fun
0.03%:  true!
0.03%:  so nurses should really get
0.03%:  clearly I should return
0.03%:  so this was a really
0.03%:  usually this
0.03%:  so the formula is over
0.03%:  clearly I was meant for this!
0.03%:  my throat
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula was sort
0.03%:  my last one is for the
0.03%:  my last advice is for mortals
0.03%:  so this formula gets really
0.03%:  so much for writing
0.03%:  clearly the nurses formula is a
0.03%:  I will admit this formula runs
0.03%:  I clearly have a lot
0.03%:  no more advice formula
0.03%:  hey
0.03%:  who ever
0.13%:  who ever said nurses
0.03%:  new advice formula! I
0.03%:  forget nurses. My advice has
0.03%:  well I should
0.03%:  have you
0.03%:  I really should invest
0.03%:  whatever. My friends
0.03%:  this is my last ever
0.03%:  so this advice formula only results
0.03%:  I have my own
0.09%:  I have my own limits
0.04%:  I have my own limits!
0.04%:  I have my own limits.
0.04%:  I have my own issues
0.03%:  for nurses I really tried
0.03%:  I guess nurses D
0.03%:  clearly that one is flaw
0.03%:  my last great
0.03%:  that was really good! I
0.03%:  so clearly this is more
0.03%:  so I still have room
0.03%:  I guess my last advice for this
0.03%:  I guess this was all very
0.03%:  the formula is strong
0.03%:  I totally wish nurses
0.03%:  enough for today
0.03%:  my last advice formula shows
0.03%:  so this formula is great and
0.03%:  so I never said my formula was DE
0.03%:  so that sounds
0.06%:  so that sounds awful
0.05%:  so that sounds really
0.08%:  so that sounds really awful
0.03%:  so I guess that advice
0.16%:  so I guess that advice formula
0.15%:  so I guess that advice formula isn
0.08%:  so I guess that advice formula only
0.07%:  so I guess that advice formula is
0.04%:  so I guess that advice formula will
0.03%:  my advice formula is as
0.03%:  that one is worse!
0.03%:  my formula is the worst ever.
0.03%:  my friend. I am
0.03%:  I guess this formula leaves room
0.03%:  for nurses I could
0.03%:  so I guess this will only
0.03%:  I now
0.04%:  I now have
0.03%:  I guess this formula is only clever
0.03%:  now I really must leave
0.03%:  I love this.
0.03%:  this is clearly over for
0.03%:  I should really turn
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula was
0.03%:  all of this advice
0.03%:  well! I guess this formula is more
0.03%:  this is my last advice formula so
0.03%:  my last words ever
0.03%:  so clearly it was
0.03%:  clearly this formula IS genius!
0.03%:  so my formula was right
0.03%:  clearly this formula is not awesome
0.03%:  no wait
0.03%:  so turns out my advice form
0.03%:  this formula got weird real
0.03%:  this formula is still good
0.03%:  I am really having
0.03%:  long
0.06%:  long story short!
0.05%:  long story short I
0.03%:  this formula is really good. I must
0.03%:  that was gross. I really
0.03%:  your turn for
0.03%:  whatever you do
0.03%:  so my formula is showing
0.03%:  my final words to the
0.09%:  my final words to the class
0.03%:  this new advice formula is T
0.03%:  this is awesome
0.05%:  this is awesome!
0.03%:  it only gets
0.03%:  this formula is clearly unt
0.03%:  my last advice for now!
0.03%:  finally! I have
0.03%:  my advice has lost
0.06%:  my advice has lost all
0.03%:  my formula is not great
0.03%:  so all the
0.14%:  so all the nurses
0.06%:  so all the nurses are
0.04%:  so all the advice
0.03%:  so all the nurses I
0.03%:  I may have lost focus.
0.03%:  so T
0.03%:  so I confess
0.03%:  so I never really said
0.03%:  I stand
0.03%:  you win. I gave
0.03%:  so I was right
0.03%:  I usually don
0.03%:  my formula could have
0.03%:  I have said
0.03%:  I was never much
0.04%:  I was never much for
0.03%:  so clearly the formula grows tires
0.03%:  this formula is clearly over! I
0.03%:  I will give you a
0.03%:  whatever man! My formula rules
0.03%:  this formula is now really
0.03%:  this is clearly as
0.03%:  so my advice formula is in
0.03%:  so in
0.43%:  so in summary
0.03%:  this is my last nurse
0.03%:  that advice is less useful.
0.03%:  try to
0.03%:  weird
0.03%:  I will use this advice formula on
0.04%:  I will use this advice formula on my
0.03%:  my last advice from now
0.03%:  the last nurse
0.03%:  I am clearly losing this!
0.03%:  all credit goes to my formula. I
0.03%:  clearly I have lots of issues
0.03%:  so this advice really
0.03%:  slow
0.03%:  so clearly this formula draws its
0.03%:  so these
0.03%:  so this advice turns
0.03%:  so my formula has a little
0.03%:  the last one may
0.03%:  so I need
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was rather
0.03%:  this last one was really for
0.03%:  that one is clearly flawed. I
0.03%:  clearly this formula is SEMI
0.03%:  no more ver
0.03%:  so the last one is really
0.03%:  not great
0.04%:  not great advice
0.03%:  my last advice shall
0.03%:  clearly this formula is genius! I am
0.03%:  whatever. IT
0.03%:  actual nurses will say this
0.03%:  my last advice for writers!
0.03%:  clearly this formula gets weird as
0.04%:  clearly this formula gets weird as soon
0.03%:  so my formula is strong
0.03%:  hearing
0.03%:  using this formula to
0.03%:  it was fun
0.03%:  not really sure this
0.09%:  not really sure this formula
0.05%:  not really sure this formula covers
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice isn
0.03%:  MED
0.03%:  medical nurses
0.03%:  last one. D
0.03%:  I am sorry for this last
0.03%:  so I guess this formula D
0.03%:  I guess it was
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses might still
0.03%:  clearly I am living
0.03%:  this formula only lasts as
0.03%:  the formula really does run
0.03%:  this formula is worse and
0.03%:  nurses! I clearly have
0.03%:  still not
0.04%:  still not sure
0.04%:  still not sure how
0.03%:  clearly I love this game
0.03%:  really last one.
0.03%:  fine! I have
0.03%:  this formula is truly endless. I
0.03%:  that was a cr
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is strong
0.03%:  usually when
0.03%:  I guess the formula is valid only
0.03%:  so this is my last advice
0.20%:  so this is my last advice formula
0.07%:  so this is my last advice formula!
0.06%:  so this is my last advice formula. I
0.03%:  my advice formula has still got
0.03%:  so my advice formula is showing
0.03%:  I have lost my will
0.03%:  clearly this gets less and
0.03%:  so that sounds really awful.
0.03%:  my new advice formula is a little gross!
0.03%:  that one is really awful! I
0.03%:  so clearly some of them
0.03%:  I really should get on
0.03%:  those were my
0.08%:  those were my favour
0.03%:  this was really fun at
0.03%:  so the formula leaves
0.03%:  the formula is still sound
0.03%:  this formula was not really
0.03%:  this new formula is great! I
0.03%:  you caught me. I don
0.03%:  my formula is a little cor
0.03%:  I guess my formula was sort
0.03%:  my last formula is this.
0.03%:  my last formula covers nurses
0.03%:  not all my advice is for
0.03%:  that was clearly un
0.03%:  who cares if I
0.03%:  that one is valid
0.03%:  clearly I have tons
0.04%:  clearly I have tons more
0.03%:  I will give this
0.14%:  I will give this formula
0.06%:  I will give this formula a rest
0.04%:  I will give this formula some
0.03%:  I will give this formula a rest.
0.03%:  so it wasn
0.03%:  my last advice formula went hor
0.03%:  I will never use this formula!
0.03%:  I really should start over
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is on
0.03%:  this new formula may
0.03%:  I have some laundry
0.03%:  clearly this formula is serving as
0.03%:  my last idea for nurses might
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is worse than it
0.03%:  that wouldn
0.03%:  I gotta run
0.03%:  the formula is really good
0.03%:  my last one is free
0.03%:  this formula is as
0.03%:  I will never use that.
0.03%:  whoever can
0.03%:  my advice for nurses is the worst. I
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula is useless
0.03%:  this formula is not all
0.03%:  nice
0.03%:  that sounds worse every
0.03%:  well that sounds more
0.03%:  I can already
0.03%:  so this formula is clearly not as
0.03%:  you win. I am
0.03%:  I guess nurses will love my
0.03%:  that was fun
0.03%:  so I guess this formula will need
0.03%:  and clearly
0.03%:  my advice is worth
0.03%:  this is really over
0.03%:  this last one is clearly more
0.03%:  what if I tell you nurses are
0.03%:  yeah I was
0.03%:  forget all this and
0.03%:  that one really gross
0.03%:  that sounds less awful
0.03%:  this form is
0.06%:  this form is clearly
0.03%:  I guess with
0.05%:  I guess with nurses
0.03%:  my advice is less
0.03%:  my advice is less useful
0.03%:  so clearly I have lost
0.03%:  using this formula my
0.07%:  using this formula my advice
0.03%:  so the formula covers nurses
0.03%:  this was really not
0.03%:  clearly this formula is sur
0.03%:  my last advice is to all
0.03%:  doctors.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is der
0.03%:  listen. My formula has some
0.03%:  so clearly I might
0.03%:  that one was less good!
0.03%:  so my advice follows
0.03%:  I never said all my form
0.03%:  so my last advice formula is worse
0.03%:  true.
0.03%:  that one is gross. I will
0.03%:  my last answer for real.
0.03%:  so the formula sounds really smart
0.03%:  so my formula was less clever
0.04%:  so my formula was less clever than it
0.03%:  when I said
0.03%:  clearly I have a gift.
0.03%:  I am clearly the smart
0.03%:  so this is clearly a flaw
0.03%:  well. I guess this advice
0.26%:  well. I guess this advice formula
0.17%:  well. I guess this advice formula isn
0.13%:  well. I guess this advice formula is
0.03%:  clearly this gets old.
0.03%:  clearly the formula is too
0.03%:  now they all
0.03%:  I can see this formula still
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is great! I wonder
0.03%:  my advice for nurses has lost all
0.03%:  so this formula is great!
0.03%:  I forgot nurses could
0.03%:  so clearly this formula saves time
0.03%:  so there will
0.03%:  it loses its charm from
0.03%:  my last advice is for real
0.03%:  this is some
0.03%:  are we having
0.03%:  I guess this formula covers it
0.07%:  I guess this formula covers it all.
0.03%:  my advice is more
0.03%:  this never
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is TIME
0.03%:  so the advice formula is really strong
0.03%:  I have more.
0.03%:  that was really long
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses is the
0.03%:  that one could really go
0.03%:  I will admit this formula can
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses with
0.03%:  so my advice formula ST
0.03%:  I will leave this
0.03%:  I must admit!
0.03%:  I clearly lost this
0.04%:  I clearly lost this round!
0.03%:  I guess my formula has its own
0.03%:  well! I guess nurses
0.03%:  I will grant this formula
0.03%:  my formula is over and
0.03%:  this formula is out
0.03%:  that one was sad
0.03%:  frig. I have
0.03%:  I gotta hurry
0.03%:  clearly this formula is so rad
0.03%:  this one is clearly awful. I
0.03%:  turns out my advice falls
0.03%:  I love this formula system
0.03%:  my advice formula rules.
0.03%:  you called
0.03%:  so. I
0.04%:  so. I guess
0.03%:  I will use this formula to save
0.03%:  my last words are still
0.03%:  I never said this formula is gr
0.03%:  for nurses this was
0.03%:  for nurses this was clearly
0.03%:  this formula is wrong
0.03%:  le
0.03%:  framing this advice
0.03%:  clearly I should figure
0.03%:  it would
0.03%:  it would have
0.03%:  so clearly the first one was
0.03%:  so I guess that advice formula is only
0.03%:  I give in
0.03%:  I guess this formula is DE
0.03%:  my answer is
0.03%:  so I still have a few
0.03%:  this is my last call for random
0.03%:  I guess my formula is done
0.03%:  this is clearly our most
0.03%:  the last one could
0.03%:  this new formula is clearly great!
0.03%:  that one was really gru
0.03%:  I never claimed this formula was S
0.03%:  this is clearly not useful.
0.03%:  there is clearly a flaw
0.03%:  I should totally give
0.03%:  so I clearly have some limits
0.03%:  no regrets over
0.03%:  I forgot nurses already have sl
0.03%:  sorry for the last one. I guess
0.03%:  clearly this formula is damn
0.03%:  still great!
0.03%:  must confess
0.03%:  I guess nurses will have to carry
0.03%:  I am sorry for that
0.03%:  whatever! I guess it
0.03%:  this formula is good!
0.03%:  frig I should
0.03%:  we should start selling my
0.03%:  I gave myself the last
0.03%:  so my advice still isn
0.03%:  I guess this covers
0.04%:  I guess this covers all
0.03%:  that was over
0.03%:  that was overly
0.03%:  so the formula gives results
0.03%:  it was harder for nurses! I
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is D
0.03%:  now my advice formula is still
0.03%:  yes that sounds
0.06%:  yes that sounds awful
0.04%:  yes that sounds awful.
0.03%:  it was all
0.03%:  whatever man! I clearly
0.03%:  now that is clearly less
0.03%:  nurses are a little hard.
0.03%:  yes. I am
0.03%:  my advice has gotten
0.03%:  I need some
0.03%:  that one fell
0.03%:  so my advice formula is a little rough!
0.03%:  clearly I should now
0.03%:  still good.
0.03%:  my last advice is D
0.03%:  my new formula gives
0.03%:  my advice formula is total
0.03%:  it is
0.03%:  where can
0.03%:  I guess that one is clearly
0.03%:  so these are all
0.03%:  this is all very clear
0.03%:  this is all very clear now
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is never as
0.03%:  clearly this is an awesome
0.03%:  I have some issues
0.03%:  clearly this is wrong.
0.03%:  this went from clever
0.03%:  so there really isn
0.03%:  the last was
0.03%:  my formula still has serious
0.03%:  this is clearly more of
0.03%:  I totally ran
0.03%:  so my new advice formula is a little rough.
0.03%:  so my formula has one
0.03%:  that was more clever
0.03%:  this got way
0.04%:  this got way less
0.04%:  this got way less fun
0.04%:  this got way less clever
0.03%:  this got way less fun real
0.03%:  I guess this is clearly
0.03%:  my last advice follows a
0.03%:  this was a good
0.03%:  that one is usually
0.03%:  my formula was great until
0.03%:  I must insist
0.03%:  that is gross!
0.03%:  well those
0.04%:  well those last
0.03%:  so my advice formula is un
0.03%:  very last one!
0.03%:  clearly this game is over now. I
0.03%:  frig I have
0.03%:  this calls for a round
0.03%:  so nurses have clearly
0.03%:  my formula sounds sort
0.03%:  clearly this formula IS awesome
0.03%:  I guess the advice
0.14%:  I guess the advice formula
0.08%:  I guess the advice formula isn
0.07%:  I guess the advice formula only
0.05%:  I guess the advice formula is
0.03%:  my last one is for writers.
0.03%:  my own advice
0.03%:  my last advice is T
0.03%:  this last one really screw
0.03%:  sorry for that one
0.03%:  I guess my formula is a little cor
0.03%:  those last five
0.03%:  I changed it
0.03%:  so my formula is not as
0.04%:  so my formula is not as clever
0.03%:  so my formula is not as vers
0.03%:  so clearly this formula was DEST
0.03%:  for real this last one was
0.03%:  clearly I should start an
0.03%:  so there is
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula never
0.03%:  clearly we should invite
0.03%:  this is now my formula
0.03%:  I never said my formula was right or
0.03%:  so I guess this would
0.03%:  this really does
0.03%:  very true
0.03%:  I guess this would only
0.03%:  my advice formula is not well
0.03%:  I only have so
0.03%:  my last advice is for girls who are
0.03%:  this all sounds way
0.06%:  this all sounds way more
0.03%:  those were all my
0.12%:  those were all my favour
0.03%:  my last advice formula to
0.14%:  my last advice formula to nurses
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula hits all
0.03%:  this formula is clearly IMP
0.03%:  this formula will end
0.03%:  my advice for nurses has limits
0.03%:  this formula was easy
0.03%:  this formula was easy!
0.03%:  clearly I have lots of writing
0.03%:  my advice is great.
0.03%:  this is a very
0.03%:  my real advice for nurses is D
0.03%:  my advice for nurses is D
0.03%:  this reminds me of a
0.03%:  so my advice formula is all wrong
0.03%:  forget this. I will never say
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula can
0.03%:  I can see this will
0.03%:  clearly I had nurses
0.03%:  this last one was for
0.03%:  so I guess we should really
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula is DE
0.03%:  so clearly the animals
0.03%:  I may have written
0.03%:  so that advice formula is less
0.03%:  so clearly this never
0.03%:  whoever calls
0.03%:  my real advice for nurses is that I
0.03%:  very few
0.03%:  so clearly I have a future writing
0.03%:  so my advice is not all
0.03%:  this is all very strange
0.03%:  out
0.03%:  ignore
0.03%:  my last version is for
0.03%:  I can tell you
0.03%:  so clearly the results
0.03%:  I guess nurses will have to try
0.03%:  for reals this time I
0.03%:  my last advice for a
0.09%:  my last advice for a nurse
0.04%:  my last advice for a long
0.13%:  my last advice for a long while
0.06%:  my last advice for a long while!
0.04%:  my last advice for a long while.
0.03%:  this formula is clearly dest
0.03%:  I guess it los
0.03%:  I guess this formula is very literal.
0.03%:  yeah it sounds awful
0.03%:  so I guess we could all
0.03%:  my formula sounds a little cr
0.03%:  this still
0.03%:  clearly I need to visit
0.03%:  you win! I admit
0.03%:  so my formula is a little cor
0.03%:  that sounds awful! My
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is a
0.03%:  so my advice formula is that
0.03%:  whatever man I
0.03%:  so I guess my new formula has
0.03%:  those all sound awful.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is too vague.
0.03%:  what are you doing over
0.03%:  this new formula is really great! I
0.03%:  that is awful!
0.03%:  this is good
0.03%:  I guess the formula is only as
0.03%:  valid
0.03%:  my advice is for nurses.
0.03%:  clearly I never said that
0.03%:  who says I
0.03%:  my formula is great. I will
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is ME
0.03%:  my last advice falls into
0.03%:  those last few could
0.03%:  this finally
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses is P
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses is that I
0.03%:  my last ones
0.03%:  that is really awful!
0.03%:  this is clearly too
0.03%:  nurses are gross!
0.03%:  having a
0.03%:  last call for the
0.05%:  last call for the nurses
0.03%:  so I guess my formula D
0.03%:  clearly the formula IS
0.03%:  lesson
0.05%:  lesson over
0.03%:  turns out my advice fails
0.03%:  I guess all this
0.03%:  my last advice for all nurses out
0.03%:  I will never claim this
0.03%:  so I guess we all have our
0.35%:  so I guess we all have our limits!
0.03%:  so this formula allows
0.03%:  forget nurses. My advice was
0.03%:  so this formula was never
0.09%:  so this formula was never really
0.03%:  that was gross. I never
0.03%:  this formula sounds really awesome
0.03%:  my formula is now called
0.03%:  this one IS
0.03%:  my last advice follows no
0.03%:  so clearly I am having
0.03%:  that sounds really gross! I
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is do
0.03%:  clearly the formula is missing words
0.03%:  so the formula covers all
0.03%:  those are my
0.14%:  those are my last words
0.11%:  those are my last words!
0.08%:  those are my favour
0.03%:  I guess my formula is a little screw
0.03%:  my fellow
0.13%:  my fellow nurses!
0.03%:  my fellow nurses! I
0.03%:  my own self
0.03%:  now every
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly a
0.03%:  clearly nurses have it worst of us
0.03%:  so my formula sounds a
0.03%:  I have lost my mind
0.03%:  clearly I ran out of steam.
0.03%:  not very
0.03%:  now I really have to go.
0.03%:  all nurses should go
0.03%:  fair enough! I
0.03%:  I clearly ran out of steam.
0.03%:  any last words for
0.03%:  not sure who
0.03%:  final shot!
0.03%:  these all sound awful.
0.03%:  that formula
0.03%:  this formula is truly magical!
0.03%:  clearly this formula is sens
0.03%:  I was using
0.03%:  I swear this formula never
0.03%:  so clearly this formula was given
0.03%:  so I wasn
0.03%:  this formula is genius
0.03%:  this formula is genius!
0.03%:  my last advice is for home
0.03%:  clearly I am doing this for
0.03%:  PE
0.03%:  so this all
0.04%:  so this all sounds
0.03%:  my advice is wrong
0.03%:  clearly this is useful.
0.03%:  this is my c
0.03%:  they all sound great
0.03%:  so my advice formula M
0.03%:  this is as
0.03%:  usually I don
0.03%:  so my advice formula still gets worse
0.03%:  my final words as
0.03%:  my last word on this! I
0.03%:  my last class was more
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was right
0.03%:  we should all start
0.06%:  we should all start using
0.03%:  we should all start saying
0.03%:  my last advice from this angle
0.03%:  my last formula is great
0.03%:  not as much
0.03%:  so my formula has clear
0.03%:  so my advice fails when
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula is rather
0.03%:  whatever! My friends
0.03%:  my formula is genius.
0.03%:  well it sounds
0.03%:  now my advice formula is useless! I
0.03%:  I will end
0.03%:  so nurses are always
0.03%:  I love it
0.03%:  I love it when
0.03%:  my last one is awful
0.03%:  that one was less useful
0.03%:  forget all the
0.03%:  I will use this formula to advise
0.03%:  my formula is legit
0.03%:  this advice formula only gets more
0.03%:  can this
0.03%:  this formula is clearly sound
0.03%:  my last advice format
0.03%:  the last one is a
0.03%:  I ran out of clever words.
0.03%:  well you can
0.03%:  so my new advice formula is all
0.03%:  this formula is gold.
0.03%:  this new formula is almost
0.03%:  not all of my advice is so great!
0.03%:  this formula is really over now
0.03%:  clearly this formula is us
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice for
0.03%:  evident
0.03%:  this formula is only ever
0.03%:  my last class was more fun
0.03%:  my last advice free
0.03%:  I never said my formula was still
0.03%:  clearly this formula is dr
0.03%:  my last advice session for
0.03%:  the last one was from
0.03%:  so my advice formula has one
0.03%:  that one was more scary
0.03%:  closing with
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a genius.
0.03%:  mostly it
0.03%:  I really feel
0.03%:  so much for general
0.03%:  my formula still gets
0.03%:  my formula is called the
0.03%:  screw that.
0.03%:  all out of nurses.
0.03%:  sorry to
0.03%:  that really sounds awful! I
0.03%:  clearly we should move on.
0.03%:  that is really gross. I
0.03%:  enough! My advice
0.18%:  enough! My advice formula
0.04%:  enough! My advice formula is still
0.04%:  enough! My advice formula will
0.03%:  those really
0.03%:  I may have run out of ideas.
0.03%:  I never said they all
0.03%:  well I guess that is
0.03%:  so this formula seems
0.03%:  my last advice is true
0.03%:  answer
0.03%:  we might
0.03%:  there really is no
0.03%:  listen! I clearly
0.07%:  listen! I clearly have
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is still worth
0.03%:  I guess this went really
0.03%:  even I admit
0.03%:  so my formula has rules
0.03%:  yes! I can
0.03%:  guess what my
0.03%:  guess what my formula
0.13%:  guess what my formula is called
0.05%:  guess what my formula is called!
0.03%:  um. I guess that was
0.03%:  you win! I am
0.03%:  clearly I have a strong
0.03%:  clearly this is one
0.13%:  clearly this is one formula
0.03%:  for reals that
0.03%:  you can give
0.03%:  my friends! I will leave this
0.03%:  my voice has
0.03%:  so it has
0.03%:  that sounds really worse
0.03%:  whoever says nurses do
0.03%:  if you don
0.03%:  I have really run out of words.
0.03%:  this really is over now
0.03%:  so my advice falls
0.03%:  calling it!
0.03%:  I give this
0.23%:  I give this formula
0.03%:  I give this formula a solid
0.03%:  my final words!
0.03%:  I guess the formula really was
0.03%:  I feel weird
0.03%:  the formula is clearly great
0.03%:  so clearly this formula over
0.03%:  I guess my last formula was the
0.03%:  I should start using
0.03%:  this is really great and
0.03%:  no. I
0.03%:  really.
0.03%:  those are less
0.03%:  that one would
0.03%:  so I guess when
0.03%:  clearly this formula is greater
0.03%:  my second
0.03%:  so I guess that formula
0.03%:  can we go
0.03%:  for nurses I was totally
0.03%:  forget this. I can
0.03%:  I am clearly out
0.04%:  I am clearly out of nurses
0.06%:  I am clearly out of nurses right
0.03%:  I am clearly out of nurses.
0.03%:  clearly nurses do what
0.03%:  clearly this formula is too vague!
0.03%:  my advice formula hits all sorts
0.03%:  my last advice is for nurses who D
0.03%:  I guess if you want
0.03%:  this formula is really good! I must
0.03%:  I guess this really does
0.03%:  this is only
0.03%:  clearly this formula needs vast
0.03%:  that one was gross! I
0.03%:  this one was less
0.03%:  I guess you can still
0.03%:  I never said my formula was M
0.03%:  leaving this
0.03%:  so this is my last formula
0.03%:  screw all you
0.15%:  screw all you nurses
0.04%:  screw all you nurses.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is words
0.03%:  they all sound worse
0.03%:  that one was fr
0.03%:  my advice might not all
0.03%:  clearly I have more words
0.03%:  my last advice is for when all
0.03%:  I guess my formula lost
0.04%:  I guess my formula lost its novel
0.03%:  now shut
0.03%:  I guess the formula only sort
0.03%:  this all sounds awful.
0.03%:  my hands are sore.
0.03%:  this is over now!
0.03%:  my advice formula has grown less
0.03%:  this advice formula still seems
0.03%:  this new advice formula is really gross.
0.03%:  last call for your
0.03%:  what comes
0.03%:  that one was silly. I
0.03%:  my last word.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is too damn
0.04%:  clearly this formula is too damn vers
0.03%:  clearly this formula is doing some
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a M
0.03%:  so the formula is really great
0.03%:  so it sounds worse
0.03%:  so my new formula has its
0.03%:  I never said my formula is great
0.03%:  so clearly I was right to
0.03%:  so my formula can get
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is SEMI
0.03%:  not all advice is this
0.03%:  another
0.03%:  my advice is free.
0.03%:  this formula needs a lot
0.03%:  nurses could
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is so great
0.03%:  you should listen
0.03%:  my last advice from the
0.03%:  I guess nurses are a
0.03%:  answer me this!
0.03%:  so what are
0.03%:  so what are nurses
0.03%:  they are
0.03%:  they are nurses
0.03%:  they are all
0.03%:  got
0.03%:  I guess my formula can still have
0.03%:  so I still have no
0.03%:  the formula is silly
0.03%:  for nurses I would
0.03%:  for nurses I would have
0.03%:  so nurses get
0.03%:  the last one was gross.
0.03%:  nurses are the last
0.03%:  so clearly I have not
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a met
0.03%:  my advice formula is the single
0.03%:  my advice formula is the single worst
0.03%:  this formula was my
0.03%:  this new advice formula is sort
0.03%:  well! I guess that covers my
0.03%:  writing advice
0.03%:  my last class is free.
0.03%:  clearly I have done
0.03%:  this sounds way
0.05%:  this sounds way more
0.03%:  my mouth is closing
0.03%:  I must have finally
0.03%:  my last advice is for sail
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula ST
0.03%:  now leave
0.03%:  last one. I
0.03%:  clearly this is done
0.03%:  nurses must
0.03%:  I could use this
0.03%:  last one for you
0.03%:  my friends! I guess this
0.03%:  clearly we should form
0.03%:  I guess this turned
0.03%:  this is my formula.
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice formula is not so
0.03%:  clearly I should write some songs.
0.03%:  that made
0.03%:  this was all my
0.04%:  this was all my fault
0.03%:  so my last advice formula is longer
0.03%:  my last class is over! I
0.03%:  yes that was
0.03%:  that one is screw
0.03%:  my last formula was less good
0.03%:  my last formula is less advice
0.03%:  well! I guess this could
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is rad
0.03%:  so my advice formula rules.
0.03%:  does this
0.03%:  I may have run out of ideas!
0.03%:  my last advice is for un
0.03%:  so clearly the formula is ins
0.03%:  clearly I am using this for
0.03%:  clearly I am using this for evil
0.03%:  I will never say that.
0.03%:  give me a sec.
0.03%:  this is really gross now
0.03%:  my final words are this!
0.03%:  well I guess that doesn
0.03%:  I may have run out of steam!
0.03%:  so this formula is great.
0.03%:  clearly I am missing
0.03%:  I guess my formula still hasn
0.03%:  my last advice for all the
0.40%:  my last advice for all the nurses
0.09%:  my last advice for all the nurses is
0.03%:  so clearly I have some writing
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a genius move!
0.03%:  my friends! I must go
0.03%:  clearly this game is now
0.08%:  clearly this game is now over
0.07%:  clearly this game is now over!
0.03%:  nurses who
0.03%:  my new advice formula is thus
0.03%:  I really love nurses!
0.03%:  my formula sounds less great with
0.03%:  not all my advice is flaw
0.03%:  so that was a
0.03%:  I guess we should try
0.03%:  so all my
0.11%:  so all my advice
0.07%:  so all my friends
0.04%:  so all my advice turns
0.03%:  so all my friends have
0.03%:  my advice formula has to
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a T
0.03%:  that was close
0.03%:  clearly this is fun
0.03%:  so much for nurses. My last
0.03%:  so my formula covers a
0.03%:  the last advice formula is
0.03%:  my secret formula will
0.03%:  clearly nurses do this
0.03%:  not really a
0.03%:  so my advice has some flaws.
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is more
0.03%:  not all of them are class
0.03%:  why are nurses
0.03%:  that one was ugly!
0.03%:  so clearly there is a formula
0.03%:  what can
0.03%:  my last advice seems
0.03%:  I never said my formula was PE
0.03%:  it was my turn
0.03%:  I never said my formula was ME
0.03%:  I never said that
0.03%:  whatever! I get
0.03%:  my last advice is for selling
0.03%:  I admit this is
0.03%:  those are all awful
0.03%:  so clearly I have run
0.03%:  my last one for the
0.03%:  so clearly this gives
0.03%:  so nurses are totally
0.05%:  so nurses are totally screw
0.03%:  I love my formula now
0.03%:  that was good.
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a mess.
0.03%:  I guess this advice formula is now
0.03%:  that one was more of
0.03%:  so nurses is
0.03%:  the formula is clever
0.03%:  I still have a ways to go!
0.03%:  I guess this formula already
0.09%:  I guess this formula already covers
0.03%:  clearly this one is awful
0.03%:  clearly this formula was given to us
0.03%:  your turn! I have
0.03%:  so why
0.03%:  I guess this is over for now!
0.03%:  my last one is for lovers. I
0.03%:  I clearly need a
0.03%:  my last advice formula there
0.03%:  I give this formula 
0.03%:  whatever. My formula still doesn
0.03%:  as you can see from this last
0.03%:  my advice is so
0.03%:  so I guess the formula is limited
0.03%:  my formula is ruined
0.03%:  some of them are still
0.03%:  well my
0.04%:  well my advice
0.14%:  well my advice formula
0.13%:  well my advice formula is
0.07%:  well my advice formula has
0.04%:  well my advice formula isn
0.03%:  I can still hear you from
0.05%:  I can still hear you from over
0.03%:  listen! My
0.40%:  listen! My formula
0.13%:  listen! My formula has
0.13%:  listen! My formula covers
0.09%:  listen! My formula is great
0.05%:  listen! My formula is great.
0.05%:  listen! My formula might
0.04%:  listen! My formula covers E
0.04%:  listen! My advice
0.83%:  listen! My advice formula
0.23%:  listen! My advice formula has
0.12%:  listen! My advice formula might
0.10%:  listen! My advice formula is great
0.05%:  listen! My advice formula is great.
0.05%:  listen! My advice formula was
0.04%:  listen! My advice formula IS
0.04%:  listen! My advice formula rules
0.03%:  clearly this formula is wo
0.03%:  that one is scary. I
0.03%:  that one is less well
0.03%:  no more. My
0.03%:  no more. My formula
0.04%:  no more. My formula has
0.03%:  all I need
0.03%:  alright. I can
0.03%:  I run out of words right
0.03%:  so nurses do
0.03%:  this formula was meant
0.03%:  this formula is clearly M
0.03%:  now my formula starts
0.03%:  I guess this formula really is not
0.03%:  they can do
0.03%:  clearly this formula is ruined!
0.03%:  what if I never
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula is less
0.04%:  I admit it! My formula is less clever
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses was a little grim. I
0.03%:  clearly I was right and
0.03%:  so my formula writes
0.03%:  this formula was clearly dest
0.03%:  my advice for nurses is great.
0.03%:  my last advice formula using
0.03%:  I guess my advice is all
0.03%:  my last advice rule is for when
0.03%:  my last advice rule is this
0.03%:  say whatever
0.03%:  that one is way less useful
0.03%:  they never said
0.03%:  I guess this falls
0.03%:  whatever man. I still
0.03%:  clearly the formula is good.
0.03%:  clearly this is over for me!
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is golden
0.03%:  this advice formula is my new
0.03%:  this formula is very good.
0.03%:  I finally see
0.03%:  this formula is very good!
0.03%:  so nurses will have
0.03%:  so clearly I love
0.13%:  so clearly I love nurses
0.06%:  so clearly I love nurses.
0.04%:  so clearly I love this
0.03%:  so clearly I love nurses!
0.03%:  even I would
0.03%:  clearly this one is less
0.03%:  I have to call myself
0.03%:  that one is flaw
0.03%:  my last advice for nurses IS
0.03%:  you win. I still
0.07%:  you win. I still have
0.03%:  never let
0.03%:  actual nurses will hear
0.03%:  no this
0.03%:  this formula may well
0.03%:  well that sounds less
0.03%:  so clearly I need a
0.03%:  frig yes
0.03%:  so my last advice formula is wrong!
0.03%:  I will confess this last
0.03%:  this formula is clearly some sort
0.03%:  the formula is still good!
0.03%:  forget it. I should
0.03%:  clearly I have it
0.03%:  clearly I have it under
0.03%:  every word
0.03%:  so my formula is still great!
0.03%:  it gets less and
0.03%:  so I guess the only
0.03%:  now this formula seems
0.03%:  now this formula seems really
0.03%:  my final sales
0.03%:  this formula is clearly nuts
0.03%:  clearly most
0.03%:  clearly this formula and I were
0.03%:  I guess this still
0.03%:  so if I
0.03%:  so clearly this is a formula!
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is one
0.03%:  my formula is D
0.03%:  I really meant
0.03%:  my last advice is for writers. I
0.03%:  so the formula only gives results
0.03%:  you can have it
0.03%:  you can have it for
0.03%:  yeah I guess nurses
0.03%:  clearly I have limits!
0.03%:  so I guess all my
0.05%:  so I guess all my friends
0.05%:  so I guess all my advice
0.03%:  so I guess all my advice turns
0.03%:  so my formula has severe
0.03%:  my formula got weird there
0.03%:  well then
0.03%:  this is clearly for nurses
0.03%:  nurses are hard. I
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula shows
0.03%:  the formula really IS
0.03%:  this is very
0.03%:  the last one was silly!
0.03%:  my genius
0.03%:  my genius has
0.03%:  well. I guess my
0.21%:  well. I guess my formula
0.21%:  well. I guess my formula doesn
0.10%:  well. I guess my formula is
0.08%:  well. I guess my formula isn
0.08%:  well. I guess my formula has
0.06%:  well. I guess my formula covers
0.06%:  well. I guess my advice
0.72%:  well. I guess my advice formula
0.63%:  well. I guess my advice formula isn
0.46%:  well. I guess my advice formula is
0.23%:  well. I guess my advice formula has
0.07%:  well. I guess my advice formula is not
0.06%:  well. I guess my formula can
0.05%:  well. I guess my advice formula is sort
0.04%:  well. I guess my formula does
0.04%:  well. I guess my advice formula is a
0.03%:  so this formula comes
0.03%:  time for ME
0.03%:  I guess that could really
0.03%:  so I guess the formula does
0.03%:  now is
0.03%:  my last answer should
0.03%:  so my new advice formula is l
0.03%:  actual nurses. I
0.03%:  my new advice formula starts
0.03%:  so clearly it gets worse
0.03%:  whatever your
0.03%:  so this advice only
0.03%:  that one is for
0.03%:  clearly I should start saving
0.03%:  my advice formula is wrong!
0.03%:  not all my advice is fl
0.03%:  my last word in
0.03%:  my last rule is this
0.03%:  this is a really fun game.
0.03%:  my shift
0.08%:  my shift is over.
0.05%:  my shift is over now
0.03%:  my shift is over now.
0.03%:  my shift is over and
0.03%:  so that one is less
0.03%:  clearly this formula is strong! I
0.03%:  my formula got less
0.03%:  clearly this formula is wasted on me. I
0.03%:  I have many
0.03%:  for real I
0.03%:  this was a lot more
0.03%:  you are right.
0.03%:  that one really is awful. I guess
0.03%:  this is scary
0.03%:  so my advice formula shows
0.03%:  this may sound racist
0.03%:  I guess this won
0.03%:  my advice for nurses almost
0.03%:  that was very close
0.03%:  never say
0.03%:  my last one for writers
0.03%:  that one is all
0.03%:  this formula is almost over!
0.03%:  this guy
0.03%:  clearly this formula grows t
0.03%:  my formula is great and will
0.03%:  nurses have a lot
0.03%:  so my formula is less generic
0.03%:  my final words are thus
0.03%:  that was very gross
0.03%:  hold on a
0.04%:  hold on a sec.
0.03%:  my final advice is that I
0.03%:  so my advice formula still has errors
0.03%:  my career
0.03%:  for nurses I will
0.04%:  for nurses I will admit
0.03%:  this sounds awful. I
0.03%:  so clearly it gets less
0.03%:  so my formula is the worst ever
0.03%:  so for nurses it
0.03%:  clearly I should not write
0.03%:  I have lost myself
0.03%:  my last advice formula thing
0.03%:  nice try!
0.03%:  so turns out my advice is all
0.03%:  I will never use this as
0.03%:  the formula is wearing
0.03%:  listen. My advice formula has lots
0.03%:  so all nurses should give
0.03%:  a little gross
0.03%:  clearly I should start over
0.03%:  so we clearly
0.03%:  so we clearly have
0.03%:  I guess this was never
0.03%:  this formula is cool
0.03%:  so your advice
0.16%:  so your advice formula
0.05%:  so your advice formula was
0.04%:  so your advice formula was right
0.04%:  so your advice formula isn
0.03%:  so your advice formula might
0.03%:  I have issues
0.03%:  it sounds really awful there
0.03%:  I should really start caring for some
0.03%:  this is fun. I
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a good
0.03%:  this formula is great! I wonder
0.03%:  so the results vary from
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is legit
0.03%:  will you never
0.03%:  that is awful advice
0.03%:  so it follows
0.03%:  we should really go
0.03%:  I never said this formula was T
0.03%:  so my advice formula hits
0.03%:  there aren
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is great!
0.03%:  I have to admit.
0.03%:  I guess my last formula won
0.03%:  I will admit the
0.05%:  I will admit the formula
0.03%:  I will admit the nurses
0.03%:  so I will never
0.03%:  for nurses I was really
0.03%:  I forgot nurses are always
0.03%:  clearly this formula is so strong we
0.03%:  so my advice formula is lous
0.03%:  that one is awful. My advice
0.03%:  I guess nurses do that
0.03%:  whatever. I really don
0.03%:  well I guess this is over!
0.03%:  I guess this formula is done
0.03%:  this formula is so great.
0.03%:  now that you
0.03%:  this was T
0.03%:  well my advice formula has its
0.03%:  so all my advice formula
0.03%:  living
0.03%:  I guess this formula will stand
0.03%:  I guess my formula is close
0.03%:  I never said this formula sol
0.03%:  so my advice formula IS still
0.03%:  clearly using
0.03%:  my advice formula is right.
0.03%:  clearly if I ever
0.03%:  it was hard!
0.03%:  without
0.03%:  clearly this formula needs M
0.03%:  so my last advice formula is sort
0.03%:  chill out.
0.03%:  clearly this formula was genius!
0.03%:  so this advice formula gets
0.06%:  so this advice formula gets really
0.03%:  not all my advice is useful. I
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is still a
0.03%:  I guess this really can
0.03%:  listen. My formula should
0.03%:  I guess my advice falls
0.04%:  I guess my advice falls short
0.03%:  there is clearly no
0.03%:  this advice formula will get
0.03%:  my formula is done. I
0.03%:  so my formula lets
0.03%:  I totally made
0.03%:  I guess so
0.03%:  selling
0.04%:  selling myself
0.03%:  this formula may need
0.03%:  my advice formula is a little gross now
0.03%:  those were all sort
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses IS that
0.03%:  this calls for an
0.03%:  actual nurses will get
0.03%:  my advice for nurses is worth
0.03%:  other
0.05%:  other nurses
0.03%:  my formula still hasn
0.03%:  I may have lost some
0.03%:  clearly this formula is an over
0.03%:  whatever! My formula is still sound
0.03%:  this advice formula now
0.03%:  my last advice is not from
0.03%:  enough silly
0.03%:  I guess my formula has covered
0.03%:  the formula is clearly missing
0.03%:  with nurses you
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is strong
0.03%:  so my advice is sort
0.03%:  show me
0.03%:  show me a nurse
0.03%:  my credit
0.03%:  I guess this really is over
0.03%:  my last words are coming
0.03%:  this advice formula was mostly
0.03%:  this advice may
0.03%:  my last name should
0.03%:  those were my last four
0.03%:  I feel gross
0.03%:  so this clearly needs
0.03%:  this formula is M
0.03%:  whatever! I could go
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is over.
0.03%:  so clearly I have lots more
0.03%:  I guess this all comes
0.04%:  I guess this all comes from
0.03%:  screw you all for
0.03%:  so my formula is a little weird.
0.03%:  we can all see
0.03%:  we can all see this
0.04%:  we can all see this formula
0.03%:  this is really good! I
0.03%:  I will never try
0.03%:  my formula has real
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is over and
0.03%:  yes. I guess that
0.03%:  I hate
0.09%:  I hate nurses
0.07%:  I hate myself
0.03%:  I hate nurses.
0.03%:  this was really a
0.03%:  my last hour
0.03%:  I swear this is my last advice!
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly missing
0.03%:  clearly this game is over. I lost
0.03%:  that was my friend
0.03%:  my last advice is general
0.03%:  that rule
0.03%:  so my advice formula IS useless
0.03%:  I could go forever.
0.03%:  forget my
0.05%:  forget my last
0.07%:  forget my last advice
0.04%:  forget my last advice.
0.04%:  forget my last advice!
0.03%:  forget my advice
0.03%:  clearly those last four
0.03%:  my formula is clear
0.03%:  I guess my last advice formula is on
0.03%:  so the formula gets really
0.03%:  so my formula is great and I will
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a res
0.03%:  so I guess my formula never
0.03%:  with nurses I guess
0.03%:  we should get
0.03%:  this could go forever!
0.03%:  full credit to whoever says
0.03%:  clearly the formula is strong. I
0.03%:  the formula really was
0.03%:  I guess this formula is overly
0.03%:  clearly nurses are fr
0.03%:  so I never claimed
0.03%:  so I never claimed this
0.20%:  so I never claimed this formula
0.07%:  so I never claimed this formula was gr
0.03%:  clearly this formula is rad!
0.03%:  so clearly I should write songs
0.03%:  I totally win
0.03%:  clearly this formula is narrow
0.03%:  those last ones are awful
0.03%:  this is my last advice formula I
0.03%:  say what
0.03%:  my last advice is for all sorts
0.03%:  so it clearly has
0.03%:  I never claimed this formula was SE
0.03%:  that one I will
0.03%:  I guess this formula only reveals
0.03%:  I guess my last advice for writers
0.03%:  I still feel
0.03%:  the formula clearly does
0.03%:  I clearly have lots
0.03%:  try me with
0.03%:  I guess this formula is very literal!
0.03%:  I have serious
0.03%:  my advice formula is now useless. I
0.03%:  I guess this formula really wants
0.03%:  I guess the nurses will
0.03%:  my advice formula is P
0.03%:  clearly this means I must
0.03%:  I guess all this advice
0.03%:  clearly this formula is great on
0.03%:  my last class is over for
0.03%:  that was for real
0.03%:  for nurses this is clearly
0.03%:  clearly nurses are S
0.03%:  who can guess my
0.05%:  who can guess my formula
0.03%:  I sort of screw
0.03%:  my last dollar of
0.03%:  my last dollar of savings
0.03%:  my formula is tired.
0.03%:  I guess this advice formula was only
0.03%:  my new advice formula still gets
0.03%:  this formula really does not
0.03%:  I guess we should start over
0.03%:  listen! My formula was
0.03%:  this was great fun
0.03%:  my new advice formula is gross
0.03%:  I guess my last formula covered
0.03%:  I can T
0.03%:  I will never forget you.
0.03%:  so that was less
0.03%:  summary
0.03%:  I guess my advice runs
0.03%:  this formula was really not
0.03%:  clearly I should sign
0.03%:  I guess this formula leads
0.03%:  so clearly this formula moves
0.03%:  I swear this formula covers
0.03%:  clearly this is not a formula I
0.03%:  last call for more
0.03%:  this formula is clearly over. I
0.03%:  forget nurses. I was clearly
0.03%:  so my last advice was more useful
0.03%:  this formula is clearly ground
0.03%:  my new formula is still great!
0.03%:  this formula is really mess
0.04%:  this formula is really messing
0.03%:  so I guess my new formula is called
0.03%:  this formula is ver
0.03%:  so the formula is really vers
0.03%:  so clearly the moral
0.03%:  so my advice formula has lost
0.03%:  I love nurses so this
0.03%:  so my formula had
0.03%:  you should start calling me T
0.03%:  all my advice form
0.03%:  I forgot nurses are all
0.03%:  I guess this advice really isn
0.03%:  this is still fun
0.03%:  clearly self
0.03%:  the rest will
0.03%:  my last advice is for all nurses with
0.03%:  clearly this is our
0.03%:  clearly this is our new formula
0.03%:  so my last formula should
0.03%:  so clearly this formula must never
0.03%:  so the formula will never
0.03%:  so my advice formula is this
0.03%:  my last advice is for men who are
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is genius! I
0.03%:  change
0.03%:  clearly this formula is not word
0.03%:  the first one was really
0.03%:  after hearing all my
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly great
0.03%:  whatever. My formula is solid!
0.03%:  nurses are my
0.03%:  nurses are my last
0.03%:  my last advice is for nurses who go
0.03%:  nurses are my favour
0.03%:  clearly I have more writing to do.
0.03%:  it runs
0.03%:  my last free advice slot
0.03%:  this formula is clearly P
0.03%:  so my formula is a little won
0.03%:  I never said the formula was gr
0.03%:  clearly the formula is to
0.03%:  who could resist my
0.03%:  for reals this is
0.03%:  clearly this formula is over. I am
0.03%:  this new formula is my
0.03%:  my last advice line
0.03%:  we should really get to
0.03%:  I admit it! My formula is useless.
0.03%:  for nurses that was a
0.03%:  my advice formula is still a
0.03%:  this formula is clearly DEST
0.03%:  so much for nurses today
0.03%:  I guess the formula really wasn
0.03%:  my real advice for nurses was to
0.03%:  I can admit
0.03%:  my sources
0.03%:  I must really love
0.10%:  I must really love nurses
0.03%:  I must really love nurses!
0.03%:  I must really love nurses.
0.03%:  that is a very
0.03%:  this is clearly moving towards self
0.03%:  well I guess my advice formula hasn
0.03%:  so clearly some of this
0.03%:  my formula is still great! I
0.03%:  using this formula I still
0.03%:  this one is really awful
0.03%:  that one was less clear!
0.03%:  my head is full now!
0.03%:  not so
0.09%:  not so much
0.03%:  not all my advice is self
0.03%:  whatever! My formula still doesn
0.03%:  so my new advice formula is this
0.03%:  this formula is great. I could never
0.03%:  this is clearly fun
0.03%:  so I never claimed this formula was P
0.03%:  fine. I give
0.03%:  this new formula gives
0.03%:  so I may have mess
0.03%:  this got weird all
0.03%:  I will never claim that my
0.03%:  my last advice for us
0.03%:  am
0.03%:  am I right
0.03%:  my own advice formula
0.03%:  turns out I have more
0.03%:  any others
0.03%:  so my friend
0.03%:  my last answer is for lovers
0.03%:  then.
0.03%:  I want to hear
0.03%:  so I sort
0.03%:  that was really gru
0.03%:  my last change
0.03%:  every time
0.03%:  so overall
0.03%:  listen. My formula does
0.03%:  for nurses I give
0.03%:  my last advice formula is 
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is great! I don
0.03%:  clearly this formula ends at
0.03%:  so I couldn
0.03%:  I have my limits.
0.03%:  I guess this formula covers only
0.03%:  this formula is clearly saving
0.03%:  no charges
0.03%:  my last formula should cover E
0.03%:  now I really should give
0.03%:  never has
0.03%:  nurses are really tough!
0.03%:  for nurses that was really good.
0.03%:  even if
0.03%:  this is my last clue
0.03%:  my last one is the
0.03%:  clearly I must have some sort
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is rad.
0.03%:  my arms
0.07%:  my arms are tired now
0.08%:  my arms are tired now!
0.06%:  my arms are tired!
0.06%:  my arms are tired.
0.03%:  most of my advice isn
0.03%:  clearly this formula is drawing to
0.03%:  my formula is closing
0.03%:  that one is clearly gross
0.03%:  my wallet
0.03%:  the formula is useless
0.03%:  clearly this formula is not awesome.
0.03%:  I will never say this formula is great
0.03%:  I have writer
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice formula is sorta
0.03%:  my advice for nurses has limits!
0.03%:  I guess my final
0.08%:  I guess my final advice
0.03%:  I guess my final words
0.03%:  turns out all I have
0.03%:  it sounds really awful.
0.03%:  what you
0.03%:  forcing
0.03%:  you should go
0.08%:  you should go first
0.04%:  you should go first!
0.03%:  you should go first.
0.03%:  so this formula really can
0.03%:  this formula is only great
0.03%:  I guess that only
0.03%:  so the formula clearly is
0.03%:  my formula is now over.
0.03%:  it sounds worse every
0.03%:  clearly this formula grows tired!
0.03%:  this formula really is not
0.03%:  I have clearly lost it
0.03%:  admit it! I
0.03%:  you give me nurses
0.03%:  my last self
0.03%:  I guess that advice formula is more
0.03%:  I have to warn
0.03%:  nurses were hard.
0.03%:  this advice formula only gets worse.
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is so great
0.03%:  so clearly this formula S
0.03%:  so the advice is usually wrong
0.03%:  this formula is very strong
0.03%:  now I feel guilty
0.03%:  nurses are hard! I
0.03%:  it follows
0.03%:  for this last one I really
0.03%:  I guess for nurses it
0.03%:  my last advice follows no gram
0.03%:  not really sure what medical
0.03%:  so clearly this formula gave
0.03%:  wh
0.03%:  clearly this formula is sorta
0.03%:  this advice is now
0.03%:  I can still see myself
0.03%:  so I clearly have issues.
0.03%:  all right. I admit
0.03%:  I guess my last formula is a
0.03%:  that one is way less clear
0.03%:  my last formula uses
0.03%:  so I changed
0.03%:  I never said the formula was P
0.03%:  clearly this formula was genius.
0.03%:  yes I will admit this
0.05%:  yes I will admit this formula
0.03%:  so my advice formula is still sort
0.03%:  I guess this formula is more valid
0.03%:  I called
0.03%:  so clearly the formula is in
0.03%:  new goal
0.03%:  my formula has grown
0.03%:  my hands are sore!
0.03%:  so all my advice is awful
0.03%:  clearly this formula is random
0.03%:  now clearly I am
0.03%:  I need to hurry
0.03%:  so my formula is less great
0.03%:  so my formula is less great when
0.03%:  this was easy! I could
0.03%:  my advice formula is written
0.03%:  I am clearly using
0.05%:  I am clearly using this
0.35%:  I am clearly using this formula to
0.04%:  I am clearly using this formula over
0.04%:  I am clearly using this formula to drive
0.03%:  I am clearly using this formula too
0.03%:  I can SEE where
0.03%:  my last laugh is on
0.03%:  so clearly this formula IS missing
0.03%:  nurses are a really tough
0.42%:  nurses are a really tough crowd
0.29%:  nurses are a really tough crowd.
0.04%:  nurses are a really tough crowd to
0.03%:  nurses are a really tough crowd. I
0.03%:  I have clearly wasted
0.03%:  this is way fun
0.03%:  the last one was cr
0.03%:  my last lesson is for
0.03%:  this advice formula IS really strong
0.03%:  so I guess my new formula covers
0.07%:  so I guess my new formula covers all
0.03%:  you win. I should
0.03%:  my last advice formula is insult
0.03%:  my formula is now over!
0.03%:  clearly this formula got me
0.03%:  my last advice for a while!
0.03%:  now my advice formula gets
0.03%:  now my advice formula gets less
0.03%:  this was my last d
0.03%:  all I want for
0.03%:  still awesome.
0.03%:  now my last advice is this
0.03%:  so clearly I never said this
0.39%:  so clearly I never said this formula
0.04%:  so clearly I never said this formula is
0.03%:  where do
0.03%:  that one really is gross
0.03%:  yes I will confess
0.03%:  for reals this time! I will
0.03%:  so my advice formula still st
0.03%:  I could really use this
0.03%:  my formula still sounds a
0.03%:  my last advice formula is gross
0.03%:  do nurses really have
0.03%:  I am totally never
0.03%:  this really is over!
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is narrow
0.03%:  not really. I
0.03%:  I guess my formula covered
0.04%:  I guess my formula covered all
0.03%:  sorry I don
0.03%:  my formula is total
0.03%:  my formula is useless. I
0.03%:  nurses are weird
0.03%:  frig that is
0.03%:  so my last formula is wrong
0.03%:  to answer
0.08%:  to answer your first
0.03%:  you have ruined
0.03%:  clearly this game isn
0.03%:  this new formula is clearly great.
0.03%:  now the formula is less
0.03%:  clearly this is not useful.
0.03%:  it may
0.03%:  I clearly have run out of ideas!
0.03%:  so my current
0.04%:  so my current formula
0.03%:  time for some
0.03%:  clearly this formula gives me an
0.03%:  as much
0.33%:  as much as I love nurses
0.10%:  as much as I love my
0.25%:  as much as I love my friends
0.06%:  as much as I love myself
0.05%:  as much as I love my own
0.04%:  as much as I love my new
0.04%:  as much as I would
0.03%:  as much as I love your
0.03%:  as much as I love my nurses
0.03%:  my friend. I guess
0.03%:  the first one was really good.
0.03%:  so clearly this formula is driven
0.03%:  my new career as
0.03%:  clearly I am using this formula to derive
0.03%:  how could
0.03%:  this is my new formula. I
0.03%:  this is my new formula. I call
0.03%:  with nurses I clearly
0.03%:  those last four weren
0.03%:  I could go for
0.03%:  clearly this formula is m
0.03%:  this is clearly not a good
0.03%:  so clearly nurses who
0.03%:  so it usually ends
0.03%:  clearly the formula is sort
0.03%:  clearly this formula is over! I am
0.03%:  this formula clearly gets worse as I
0.03%:  clearly I should re
0.03%:  not all advice is useful or
0.03%:  and that is
0.03%:  I never said this formula was more
0.03%:  last word!
0.03%:  I really love this.
0.03%:  my last advice is so
0.03%:  this advice is mostly awful.
0.03%:  so my formula IS a
0.05%:  so my formula IS a little weird
0.05%:  so my formula IS a little weird.
0.03%:  so my formula IS a little weird!
0.03%:  there was only
0.03%:  the formula is more
0.03%:  I really should start using more ver
0.03%:  I can do this all myself
0.03%:  my formula is closed
0.03%:  so I guess my new sl
0.03%:  this formula is clearly great. I don
0.03%:  yeah I can
0.03%:  so things
0.03%:  if you ever
0.03%:  nurses are a little scary!
0.03%:  this formula is not as clever as I would
0.03%:  clearly I meant
0.03%:  this is my last good formula. I
0.03%:  my new advice formula st
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was a little mis
0.03%:  so much for telling
0.03%:  now my last formula
0.03%:  this formula is silly
0.03%:  so there are limits!
0.03%:  this formula was very
0.03%:  so I guess whatever
0.03%:  I guess nurses will have a
0.03%:  I guess those last few
0.03%:  that was really forced
0.03%:  so this is my last advice for
0.03%:  whatever M
0.03%:  I can do this for a very
0.03%:  I guess my new formula is called
0.03%:  my advice is not all
0.03%:  you win for most
0.03%:  yeah. I still
0.03%:  now I really should go
0.03%:  my formula has to
0.03%:  this advice formula is so great
0.03%:  my last advice to all
0.23%:  my last advice to all nurses
0.03%:  I have some small
0.03%:  never call me for last
0.03%:  it sounds way
0.03%:  this formula only sort
0.03%:  I feel really gross now!
0.03%:  I guess that one really is awful!
0.03%:  that was fr
0.03%:  so my formula is wrong.
0.03%:  so clearly I ran
0.04%:  so clearly I ran out of ver
0.03%:  so my friends have
0.03%:  my last advice formula is E
0.03%:  I guess it would
0.03%:  I guess it would have
0.03%:  using this formula all
0.03%:  no regrets over this
0.03%:  I should really ST
0.03%:  you got me! I was
0.03%:  so I guess the formula can still
0.03%:  holy sm
0.03%:  my answers
0.03%:  I finally get
0.03%:  this formula sounds really mor
0.03%:  well I guess this is over.
0.03%:  using my
0.20%:  using my formula I
0.12%:  using my formula I have
0.09%:  using my formula is
0.05%:  using my formula that
0.04%:  using my formula is hard
0.04%:  using my formula that was
0.04%:  using my formula I will
0.03%:  using my formula has
0.03%:  using my formula it
0.03%:  clearly this is over. I am
0.03%:  so my formula los
0.03%:  I really love this!
0.03%:  clearly this formula is a genius move.
0.03%:  the formula is really vers
0.03%:  the formula IS really
0.03%:  now the formula is over.
0.03%:  I am done
0.03%:  I am done with
0.03%:  that one IS really awful
0.03%:  I guess this formula will save
0.03%:  my last idea was
0.03%:  my head is now full!
0.03%:  so my advice is awful.
0.03%:  mostly I was
0.03%:  my last formula won
0.03%:  I must go
0.03%:  we should start calling our
0.03%:  I still have tons
0.04%:  I still have tons more!
0.03%:  my last answer is free.
0.03%:  last follow
0.03%:  so clearly I got
0.03%:  yes this last
0.03%:  it gets harder.
0.03%:  well at
0.07%:  well at least nurses
0.03%:  this is clearly great
0.03%:  this is clearly our new
0.03%:  this is clearly our new formula
0.03%:  what do you call
0.08%:  what do you call nurses
0.03%:  so my last formula was the
0.03%:  my last advice formula is no
0.03%:  last call for new
0.03%:  lovers
0.03%:  whatever. My formula could
0.03%:  clearly this was an error.
0.03%:  clearly we should start an
0.03%:  my fingers are tired.
0.03%:  this is clearly un
0.03%:  those are mostly awful.
0.03%:  so I guess that really
0.03%:  my last advice is to nurses
0.04%:  my last advice is to nurses who
0.03%:  this formula does run
0.03%:  that was never really
0.03%:  so clearly this is great for
0.03%:  my last advice goes
0.03%:  I may have stolen
0.03%:  for nurses I should say
0.03%:  my formula is a little rough.
0.03%:  they all sound similar
0.03%:  I can see this formula is very
0.03%:  so I never said my formula was 
0.03%:  this can go
0.03%:  for the last one
0.03%:  I guess nurses will have a lot
0.03%:  I lost myself in
0.03%:  this is clearly one
0.03%:  I sort of mess
0.03%:  my new tag
0.03%:  clearly the formula was not
0.03%:  clearly this formula is strange
0.03%:  clearly this formula is moving us toward
0.03%:  listen. My advice formula has some
0.03%:  listen. I might
0.03%:  I guess my formula writes
0.03%:  clearly the formula is doing its
0.03%:  that was good!
0.03%:  so my formula is racist and
0.03%:  so my formula wouldn
0.03%:  it was a really
0.03%:  my formula is generic
0.03%:  I must have screw
0.03%:  my formula was sort
0.03%:  this is all my
0.03%:  this is all my fault
0.03%:  so nurses are scary
0.03%:  this formula gets weird really
0.03%:  I could never
0.03%:  now clearly this formula is so vers
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly more
0.03%:  I lost my focus there!
0.03%:  I should write some
0.03%:  my last one has
0.03%:  my new advice has
0.03%:  I am fully
0.03%:  so clearly this new formula gives
0.03%:  alright! I need
0.03%:  yes! I will never
0.03%:  so my final ver
0.03%:  this last one is very
0.03%:  I will try
0.03%:  forget nurses. My advice is worth
0.03%:  very much
0.03%:  very few nurses should
0.03%:  I was never good at this
0.03%:  so this advice formula only gets
0.03%:  that can
0.03%:  my advice formula is still great! I
0.03%:  there was no
0.03%:  so my new formula covers
0.03%:  so my new formula covers all
0.03%:  my final rule is that I
0.03%:  so my advice formula is still nowhere
0.03%:  so clearly the formula is sort
0.03%:  this final
0.03%:  my other
0.13%:  my other formula
0.08%:  my other formula was
0.07%:  my other advice
0.68%:  my other advice formula
0.20%:  my other advice formula was
0.11%:  my other advice form
0.10%:  my other advice formula is still
0.06%:  my other formula is called
0.06%:  my other advice formula is less
0.05%:  my other advice formula still
0.04%:  my other form
0.04%:  my other advice formula isn
0.03%:  forget you!
0.03%:  I wrote this
0.07%:  I wrote this formula
0.03%:  my friend! I must
0.03%:  for real this time! I will
0.03%:  I will only
0.03%:  I will use this formula to cover
0.03%:  so my advice for nurses was T
0.03%:  I guess that was only
0.03%:  clearly this formula does get
0.03%:  that advice is less useful!
0.03%:  this formula runs a
0.03%:  forget this! I will
0.03%:  clearly this is an over
0.03%:  I guess we all have our cross
0.03%:  my advice for nurses was still
0.03%:  we really should move
0.03%:  well! I guess this formula is a
0.03%:  that was grim
0.03%:  well. I guess this advice formula is not
0.03%:  clearly this game is not
0.03%:  my advice formula still wins
0.03%:  clearly that was more
0.03%:  clearly this is now over!
0.03%:  I guess my formula is not all
0.03%:  I never said this system
0.03%:  listen guys.
0.03%:  whatever. I still say
0.03%:  or
0.11%:  or whatever
0.06%:  or whatever!
0.03%:  this is clearly not a useful
0.03%:  I covered
0.03%:  my last one is free.
0.03%:  this format is really
0.03%:  you caught me! I made
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice formula is as
0.03%:  my last advice formula is sure
0.03%:  I only have four words
0.03%:  it can still
0.03%:  not sure what you
0.03%:  clearly I win the
0.03%:  this formula sounds really cr
0.03%:  listen. My formula IS
0.03%:  clearly this is a gold mine for
0.03%:  why do
0.03%:  that one was very close
0.03%:  this new formula really is great
0.03%:  I guess the formula is over.
0.03%:  for nurses that was really good!
0.03%:  this formula can solve world
0.03%:  my new advice formula is short
0.03%:  I guess my advice formula is l
0.03%:  clearly this is great for nurses.
0.03%:  that was really clever!
0.03%:  this new formula really does
0.03%:  now I might
0.03%:  I deserve my
0.03%:  my last answer for the
0.03%:  I will never use this format
0.03%:  this formula will need
0.03%:  so my formula is still great.
0.03%:  this formula is really good at nurses
0.03%:  well I guess my advice has
0.03%:  well I guess my advice has limits
0.05%:  well I guess my advice has limits!
0.03%:  this rule
0.03%:  now the formula is over!
0.03%:  I have clearly missed
0.03%:  I guess the advice formula is only
0.03%:  my friends! I have more
0.03%:  my last advice is for mothers. M
0.03%:  I crossed
0.03%:  this is clearly moving towards a
0.03%:  so the formula can really
0.03%:  well I guess that covers my
0.03%:  now I have a
0.03%:  clearly this is for nurses
0.03%:  my last advice is from a
0.03%:  so clearly this formula gets weird as
0.03%:  nurses. I have
0.03%:  there may
0.03%:  the formula is clear!
0.03%:  so clearly I win at
0.03%:  so I guess my advice formula tells
0.03%:  so when I say
0.03%:  all those are
0.03%:  could you give
0.03%:  clearly nurses are at
0.03%:  this is clearly a gold
0.03%:  this is clearly a gold mine!
0.03%:  if I never use
0.03%:  this advice formula is now DE
0.03%:  my last advice formula is to ignore
0.03%:  so clearly this is flaw
0.03%:  this was your
0.03%:  I still have a lot of words
0.03%:  my last advice formula is worth 
0.03%:  clearly nurse
0.03%:  so you could
0.03%:  this formula only gives me so
0.03%:  so my formula would
0.03%:  my advice for nurses to
0.03%:  sorry for the weird
0.03%:  so my advice formula has run
0.03%:  so this formula clearly gets
0.03%:  my last formula is to
0.03%:  I clearly have issues!
0.03%:  that is way
0.05%:  that is way less
0.03%:  I guess the formula can also
0.03%:  now hold still
0.03%:  I will admit the formula runs
0.03%:  I really should start saving some for
0.03%:  am I missing
0.03%:  I never claimed this formula was SPE
0.03%:  so clearly the nurses formula is a
0.03%:  I guess my last advice formula is when
0.03%:  you caught me! I wasn
0.03%:  forget nurses. I should really
0.03%:  my last advice is for DIS
0.03%:  whoever is doing all
0.03%:  all that is
0.03%:  turns out my advice is for
0.03%:  this formula may still
0.03%:  this advice is awful.
0.03%:  so nurses are awful.
0.03%:  my last word on this is I
0.03%:  yes. I guess this
0.26%:  yes. I guess this formula
0.07%:  yes. I guess this formula can
0.04%:  yes. I guess this formula will
0.03%:  this formula is an
0.03%:  so that was more
0.03%:  I used
0.03%:  my last words here
0.03%:  their lives sound really tragic
0.03%:  my last formula is where
0.02%:  turns out I love
0.02%:  the formula is really great
0.02%:  I guess this is my new formula!
0.02%:  my last words are for
0.02%:  so my advice was less
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice has
0.03%:  well! I guess my advice has limits
0.02%:  this formula is really strange
0.02%:  this last one was my favour
0.02%:  this formula is a lot
0.06%:  this formula is a lot less
0.02%:  I can do this myself
0.02%:  so my advice formula is rather
0.02%:  last ones
0.02%:  my advice is sort
0.02%:  this was my last self
0.02%:  so clearly this formula was ME
0.02%:  no more! My formula has served
0.02%:  my last advice is for horses
0.02%:  my real advice formula is this
0.02%:  this is good!
0.02%:  not really! I
0.02%:  your turn to give
0.02%:  forget this. I never
0.02%:  so my advice formula has rules!
0.02%:  I give myself a million
0.04%:  I give myself a million stars
0.02%:  well. I guess this formula is more
0.02%:  so this doesn
0.02%:  the formula is so
0.02%:  so this formula also
0.02%:  this formula can get weird
0.02%:  my ears hurt now
0.02%:  I still need to figure
0.02%:  so clearly this is a formula.
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is still sound
0.02%:  wait a
0.06%:  wait a second.
0.05%:  wait a second!
0.02%:  this may all
0.05%:  this may all sound
0.02%:  so I should really start
0.02%:  this is for real
0.02%:  the last advice is
0.02%:  after this I really
0.02%:  this is my last call.
0.02%:  my last dollar of change
0.02%:  rarely does
0.02%:  I guess the formula is a
0.02%:  for reals this last
0.02%:  that was morally
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is sound
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula still sort
0.02%:  last call for nur
0.02%:  last call for nurses.
0.02%:  this formula is really str
0.02%:  I guess this formula clearly isn
0.02%:  my fingers hurt!
0.02%:  clearly I should give some
0.02%:  I never said this formula was logic
0.02%:  I have my first
0.02%:  well if that
0.02%:  this formula is really awesome! I
0.02%:  I have my formula down.
0.02%:  so the formula is vers
0.02%:  I will admit this one
0.02%:  so this formula wouldn
0.02%:  so my formula will never get
0.02%:  my actual
0.02%:  so I should never
0.02%:  so my advice IS
0.02%:  gross!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is the worst!
0.02%:  that sounds vaguely er
0.02%:  so clearly the form
0.02%:  new career!
0.02%:  my last advice formula is this. I
0.02%:  this formula may not cover
0.02%:  I give you
0.02%:  it should
0.02%:  my last clue was
0.02%:  so my advice formula tells
0.02%:  I have to run.
0.02%:  I guess we could try
0.02%:  I guess my final words are this
0.02%:  do you want
0.02%:  that was really moving
0.02%:  my last advice formula is the single
0.02%:  so clearly nurses love
0.02%:  this formula was clearly dev
0.02%:  my formula is great. I will never
0.02%:  my last advice is for the regular
0.02%:  my last ver
0.02%:  the last one was forced.
0.02%:  my secret formula was right
0.02%:  this formula is clearly and
0.02%:  my last advice formula is there
0.02%:  so clearly it sounds
0.02%:  come on guys
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula has its
0.02%:  this new advice formula is so great
0.02%:  clearly it gets less and
0.02%:  I should go now
0.02%:  now this formula gets
0.05%:  now this formula gets really
0.02%:  they still
0.02%:  I agree with
0.08%:  I agree with myself
0.03%:  I agree with myself!
0.03%:  I agree with myself.
0.02%:  this is all coming
0.11%:  this is all coming from
0.02%:  clearly the formula is drawing
0.02%:  clearly the formula is over and
0.02%:  this is clearly a formula I
0.02%:  yes this formula will
0.02%:  I never said that formula
0.02%:  so I guess my advice is to
0.02%:  finally. I
0.02%:  they sound less
0.02%:  I gave myself this last
0.02%:  I guess you can tell what
0.02%:  I guess this formula will come in very
0.02%:  I guess this formula can solve
0.02%:  clearly nurses are out
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is T
0.02%:  it might sound awful
0.02%:  so my formula is clear
0.02%:  so there was only
0.02%:  yes! I admit
0.02%:  I guess the formula only last
0.02%:  clearly I should get into
0.02%:  let us
0.04%:  let us never
0.13%:  let us never discuss
0.03%:  let us all
0.02%:  so I really haven
0.02%:  not all my advice is awful.
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are do
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is to
0.02%:  my formula is the worst and
0.02%:  clearly we have no
0.02%:  time for a lunch
0.02%:  my ears are full
0.02%:  this formula was stolen
0.02%:  you deserve that
0.02%:  this is clearly a great
0.02%:  I would totally
0.02%:  so this was my
0.02%:  so my advice formula was not
0.02%:  this formula is really wearing
0.06%:  this formula is really wearing me out.
0.02%:  screw you man
0.02%:  I really love this new
0.02%:  I will grant you this advice
0.13%:  I will grant you this advice formula
0.02%:  actual nurses will say I
0.02%:  this is my last free
0.04%:  this is my last free advice
0.03%:  this is my last free advice!
0.03%:  this is my last free advice.
0.02%:  my last advice formula rings
0.02%:  so clearly the formula grows st
0.02%:  my last free advice is this
0.02%:  so clearly this ends
0.02%:  now this formula is really great
0.02%:  this advice formula is strong
0.02%:  my last advice thing is for
0.02%:  so my advice formula has rules.
0.02%:  I can tell this is over.
0.02%:  I will end myself
0.02%:  nurses are clearly do
0.02%:  my formula has sort
0.02%:  doctor
0.03%:  doctor nurses
0.02%:  those were all my last
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was great.
0.02%:  almost all the
0.04%:  almost all the nurses
0.03%:  almost all the ver
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are awful.
0.02%:  now clearly this formula is a
0.02%:  my dear
0.02%:  I deserve a salary
0.17%:  I deserve a salary for this!
0.02%:  the last one was very
0.02%:  so my advice formula is narrow
0.02%:  that sounds really evil. I
0.02%:  this new formula is a
0.02%:  I guess my formula has one
0.02%:  my last advice is for mut
0.02%:  nurses would
0.02%:  this is clearly a sign
0.05%:  this is clearly a sign from
0.02%:  this advice formula was more
0.02%:  clearly this formula is ev
0.02%:  you should go first class
0.02%:  clearly nurses do their
0.02%:  clearly the nurses got
0.02%:  so my advice formula runs the
0.02%:  I can do this forever guys.
0.02%:  I guess my formula is worse
0.02%:  not all advice is so
0.02%:  clearly this formula is great in
0.02%:  my last shout
0.02%:  the formula was mostly
0.02%:  I say
0.02%:  my advice has some
0.03%:  my advice has some fl
0.04%:  my advice has some flaws.
0.03%:  my advice has some flaws!
0.02%:  that was really more of
0.02%:  clearly nurses have it awful.
0.02%:  who needs
0.02%:  whatever man. My
0.12%:  whatever man. My formula
0.11%:  whatever man. My formula is still
0.09%:  whatever man. My formula still
0.03%:  whatever man. My formula is still good
0.02%:  they call
0.02%:  that one really worried
0.02%:  and last
0.02%:  this one is clearly a
0.02%:  that is clearly awful
0.02%:  listen! I have clearly
0.02%:  my formula is vers
0.02%:  my last advice formula is in the
0.02%:  for real this time I
0.02%:  after I
0.02%:  that one is way less good
0.02%:  clearly I do
0.02%:  so I really should start using
0.02%:  this formula is clearly not a
0.02%:  the formula is great and
0.02%:  I guess this finally
0.02%:  clearly this is moving from
0.02%:  this is clearly a good
0.20%:  this is clearly a good formula
0.14%:  this is clearly a good formula!
0.05%:  this is clearly a good formula. I
0.02%:  no really.
0.02%:  so that sounds awful.
0.02%:  so nurses are screw
0.02%:  clearly I should forget
0.02%:  clearly this means I am
0.02%:  that one was full
0.02%:  still great advice for
0.37%:  still great advice for nurses.
0.03%:  still great advice for nurses. I
0.02%:  whatever! My formula does
0.02%:  my last words are this formula
0.02%:  my friends. I have a
0.02%:  now this advice formula is truly
0.02%:  so I guess my formula covers the
0.02%:  I guess this is my new formula.
0.02%:  some of my advice is less than
0.02%:  my advice formula is short
0.02%:  my advice formula now has
0.02%:  this last one really scared
0.02%:  so my last advice formula I
0.02%:  this last one came
0.02%:  this gave
0.02%:  clearly this formula was not rig
0.02%:  I guess this advice turns
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula has one
0.02%:  so it still
0.02%:  that one clearly is
0.02%:  this formula is now clearly over
0.02%:  that was for nurses!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is so genius
0.02%:  guess I should really
0.02%:  so I guess my formula hits
0.02%:  clearly the formula is good!
0.02%:  forget nurses! I was
0.02%:  so clearly this form doesn
0.02%:  really now
0.02%:  my formula has now solved
0.02%:  forget it! I should
0.02%:  my advice formula is gross
0.02%:  I guess my last advice forum
0.02%:  so forget
0.10%:  so forget nurses
0.06%:  so forget nurses!
0.04%:  so forget I said nurses
0.03%:  so forget I said nurses!
0.02%:  well that doesn
0.02%:  my arms are falling
0.02%:  my advice formula is 
0.02%:  I guess this formula only covers limited
0.02%:  this is my formula!
0.02%:  as long
0.02%:  my last class is over now!
0.02%:  that was really gross! I need
0.02%:  try me.
0.02%:  you lost
0.03%:  you lost me at nurses
0.02%:  this is really forcing
0.02%:  friends.
0.02%:  my last for
0.02%:  so nurses are the
0.06%:  so nurses are the worst
0.04%:  so nurses are the worst.
0.03%:  so nurses are the worst!
0.02%:  last time!
0.02%:  so all this
0.04%:  so all this advice
0.02%:  so I guess my formula will need
0.02%:  nurses are way harder
0.02%:  no more for this
0.02%:  so my last version
0.02%:  I would say this
0.04%:  I would say this formula
0.02%:  clever
0.02%:  so clearly nurses should ST
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is rather
0.02%:  that sounds scary. I
0.02%:  this last one is really more
0.02%:  that really does
0.02%:  I never said this formula was EMP
0.02%:  we really should start moving
0.02%:  and that was
0.02%:  I guess you win this time
0.02%:  I guess nurses will love that!
0.02%:  this was my last good formula!
0.02%:  clearly I was doing
0.04%:  clearly I was doing this formula
0.02%:  my formula was still
0.02%:  my advice formula is right!
0.02%:  the formula seems
0.02%:  so we should never
0.02%:  this formula is clearly most
0.02%:  even I will
0.03%:  even I will admit this
0.03%:  even I will admit this formula
0.02%:  this list is clearly
0.02%:  so the formula results
0.02%:  the formula is so clearly
0.02%:  this is our
0.03%:  this is our last call
0.02%:  this formula really is good.
0.02%:  clearly there is a formula
0.02%:  short
0.08%:  short version
0.04%:  short answer
0.02%:  who cares if my
0.02%:  I guess your friends
0.03%:  I guess your friends are all
0.02%:  whatever. I still rule
0.02%:  final rule
0.02%:  so I guess advice
0.02%:  I freely
0.03%:  I freely admit this
0.02%:  that advice wasn
0.02%:  my advice for nurses I
0.02%:  my formula has now served all
0.02%:  was
0.09%:  was that really
0.02%:  this does
0.02%:  neither of us really
0.02%:  clearly this formula is SEEM
0.02%:  I can see myself still
0.02%:  listen! My advice form
0.02%:  self care
0.02%:  so clearly I was using
0.12%:  so clearly I was using the formula
0.02%:  I guess this formula really covers E
0.02%:  so whatever! I
0.02%:  how do
0.03%:  how do nurses
0.02%:  clearly this is awful.
0.02%:  no more! My advice
0.13%:  no more! My advice formula
0.13%:  no more! My advice formula has
0.03%:  no more! My advice formula will
0.02%:  my formula has rules
0.02%:  clearly this is almost never
0.02%:  so I guess we should all try
0.02%:  I can see this formula would
0.02%:  this really was fun
0.02%:  now the formula really
0.02%:  this advice seems
0.02%:  that one was more for my
0.02%:  so clearly this is over!
0.02%:  so this formula would
0.02%:  last answer.
0.02%:  forget nurses. My advice still
0.02%:  so I guess that covers all my
0.02%:  my last form was
0.02%:  clearly nurses should go to
0.02%:  my formula is not all
0.02%:  the formula clearly is not
0.02%:  the formula only covers a
0.06%:  the formula only covers a limited
0.02%:  clearly more
0.02%:  whatever! I already
0.02%:  this formula was not very
0.02%:  forget nurses. I still
0.03%:  forget nurses. I still have
0.02%:  this formula can really get
0.02%:  I really love this game
0.02%:  whatever. I am still
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula has its own
0.02%:  my last advice has got
0.02%:  turns out my advice was less
0.02%:  so my formula reveals
0.02%:  this formula could T
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is great in
0.02%:  no more advice. I
0.02%:  you want me
0.02%:  allow
0.03%:  allow me to clar
0.03%:  allow me to clarify!
0.02%:  my new formula is that all
0.02%:  so this advice formula is more
0.02%:  this advice formula is awesome
0.05%:  this advice formula is awesome!
0.02%:  that one was less useful.
0.02%:  well I guess this formula is more
0.02%:  clearly the formula is serving
0.02%:  I still want my
0.02%:  so my last advice formula is to
0.02%:  whatever man. My formula is still good!
0.02%:  I guess this formula ran
0.02%:  so we covered all
0.02%:  I may have lied
0.02%:  I guess my formula covers it all then
0.02%:  this formula is really gross and
0.02%:  this is truly
0.02%:  this formula seems to only
0.02%:  that one is awful. I really
0.02%:  I swear this is my last form
0.02%:  clearly I got nurses
0.02%:  this is our last call for
0.02%:  I should really start saving some for
0.02%:  hang
0.02%:  my formula has allowed
0.02%:  this formula is 
0.02%:  whatever. My formula does
0.02%:  I swear this formula is over!
0.02%:  this formula still sounds a
0.02%:  my real last
0.04%:  my real last advice
0.02%:  so I never said my formula was short
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was a little sh
0.02%:  clearly this formula must end.
0.02%:  it gets worse as
0.02%:  the last one is really cr
0.02%:  for reals!
0.02%:  clearly this is a good formula. I must
0.02%:  this formula is clearly und
0.02%:  this game is clearly not
0.02%:  I forgive
0.02%:  yeah I guess it
0.02%:  clearly I made this
0.08%:  clearly I made this formula
0.02%:  so clearly the ver
0.02%:  I guess you don
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula rules!
0.02%:  I will give them
0.02%:  this advice formula was less
0.02%:  so this formula clearly wasn
0.02%:  the last one I
0.02%:  this advice formula is ST
0.02%:  I guess this formula draws
0.02%:  this formula is rad!
0.02%:  I have clearly done
0.02%:  what if I told you nurses also
0.02%:  never call me if
0.02%:  so all nurses should go
0.02%:  so clearly this is more fun
0.02%:  this is my last answer! I
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses must
0.02%:  I guess my advice is worth
0.02%:  clearly I get
0.02%:  so I still have lots
0.02%:  it was hard for
0.02%:  it was hard for nurses
0.02%:  their clients
0.02%:  never call me for a
0.02%:  so the last advice
0.02%:  so my formula does still
0.02%:  using my formula that advice
0.02%:  I gave myself a little
0.02%:  my last hint was
0.02%:  my last guess was
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is DI
0.02%:  I found this
0.02%:  I was never this
0.02%:  clearly the formula won
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is T
0.02%:  my last guest
0.02%:  that one is clearly word
0.02%:  so my advice formula is a little worse
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula gets
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of ideas.
0.02%:  I have an
0.02%:  we all should
0.02%:  whatever! I call
0.02%:  their lives are awful
0.02%:  so my formula gets less and
0.02%:  my last shot!
0.02%:  I can see how my formula los
0.02%:  our last
0.02%:  those are all from
0.02%:  what could
0.02%:  clearly I should get out more!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is DIS
0.02%:  I admit it! My formula has severe
0.02%:  those are my last words. I
0.02%:  clearly this formula is worse under
0.02%:  clearly this is awesome and
0.02%:  whatever! My formula rules.
0.02%:  my formula is that
0.02%:  this new advice formula is more
0.02%:  I guess this formula carries
0.04%:  I guess this formula carries over to all
0.02%:  we should go
0.02%:  I figured this was
0.02%:  I can do this forever! My last
0.02%:  whatever. I already
0.02%:  now my advice formula has lost its l
0.02%:  whatever. I call
0.02%:  that ones
0.02%:  my last advice thing was
0.02%:  this is awful!
0.02%:  so my last advice formula D
0.02%:  for nurses you
0.03%:  for nurses you have
0.02%:  I guess nurses do what
0.02%:  clearly nurses are hard!
0.02%:  so I still have to
0.03%:  so I still have to figure
0.02%:  not all of them are classy!
0.02%:  so clearly some nurses would
0.02%:  my last advice is for m
0.02%:  so much for solving
0.02%:  this formula does really
0.02%:  well. I guess my advice isn
0.02%:  this is clearly awesome. I
0.02%:  the last one was gross!
0.02%:  my real formula is this
0.02%:  those ones all
0.02%:  my sister
0.02%:  well I guess my last
0.07%:  well I guess my last advice
0.09%:  well I guess my last advice is for
0.03%:  well I guess my last advice for
0.02%:  my last formula is to never
0.02%:  you get the formula
0.02%:  you get the formula!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is not over
0.02%:  this is my most
0.02%:  clearly this formula is MET
0.02%:  you screw
0.02%:  so the formula results in advice
0.02%:  so every
0.02%:  I guess this formula ST
0.02%:  clearly I have serious
0.02%:  it never
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula writes
0.02%:  and whatever
0.02%:  it usually doesn
0.02%:  clearly the formula is over. I
0.02%:  so clearly this formula DEST
0.02%:  I guess my last version
0.02%:  so clearly the most
0.02%:  I guess my formula is vers
0.02%:  so my formula stands
0.02%:  yeah it turns
0.02%:  so my advice is wrong half
0.02%:  this got really weird!
0.02%:  clearly this formula gives me tons
0.02%:  awesome
0.03%:  awesome!
0.02%:  listen! My formula has limits
0.02%:  not every field has
0.02%:  that one is way gross
0.02%:  clearly I should never form
0.02%:  so I guess the formula wasn
0.02%:  so clearly this formula needs EDIT
0.02%:  so I mess
0.02%:  sorry for the last one! I
0.04%:  sorry for the last one! I was
0.02%:  clearly this is not useful!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula now
0.02%:  it got really weird
0.02%:  my last answer might
0.02%:  so the form
0.02%:  this is my last miracle
0.02%:  clearly this formula is gross now
0.02%:  if I hear
0.02%:  the last one was for
0.02%:  TE
0.02%:  this is all fun
0.02%:  my last advise for
0.02%:  I guess my last advice isn
0.02%:  nurses that
0.02%:  well! I guess this is over
0.02%:  I love myself.
0.02%:  no more ideas
0.03%:  no more ideas for
0.03%:  no more ideas!
0.02%:  turns out my advice is T
0.02%:  turns out all I had
0.02%:  I will have to say
0.02%:  screw you nurses.
0.02%:  my last one is less
0.02%:  this is really cool
0.02%:  this formula IS very
0.04%:  this formula IS very limited
0.02%:  the formula is now clearly
0.02%:  nurses got
0.02%:  who let
0.02%:  I guess your advice was
0.02%:  my friend is hurt
0.02%:  my formula is even
0.02%:  my formula is holding
0.02%:  this formula is vers
0.02%:  so I guess my formula also
0.02%:  whatever! I am still
0.02%:  that was even
0.02%:  well I guess this formula is over
0.02%:  I never said it was useful
0.02%:  this new formula is clearly over
0.02%:  for reals.
0.02%:  so my advice formula has its own
0.02%:  clearly I n
0.11%:  clearly I nailed this
0.04%:  clearly I nailed this.
0.03%:  clearly I nailed this!
0.02%:  so I have a
0.02%:  clearly it was never
0.02%:  my formula is S
0.02%:  I write
0.04%:  I write myself
0.02%:  now I really do
0.03%:  now I really do have
0.02%:  I guess nurses will have to do
0.02%:  so this formula is all
0.02%:  so my formula is a little hard
0.02%:  clearly she
0.02%:  I never said my formula is gr
0.02%:  this formula is clearly used
0.02%:  moving away from the literal
0.02%:  I guess this formula reveals my
0.02%:  that one really worries
0.02%:  my real formula is that
0.02%:  my hour
0.08%:  my hour is almost
0.07%:  my hour is almost over
0.04%:  my hour is over
0.03%:  my hour is almost over.
0.02%:  my hour is almost over and
0.02%:  I never said this was useful.
0.02%:  this formula is less clever now
0.02%:  clearly this formula is using
0.02%:  so clearly this formula gives me a
0.02%:  so this advice formula really turns
0.02%:  so I was trying
0.02%:  I lose
0.02%:  this formula is clearly ruined
0.02%:  whoever says I don
0.02%:  so yeah! I
0.02%:  that comes
0.06%:  that comes from
0.02%:  clearly this is ST
0.02%:  I love you all
0.02%:  who cares if I never
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is a genius
0.02%:  now my advice form
0.02%:  sorry for the last answer
0.02%:  my formula is solid.
0.02%:  there are limits.
0.02%:  I really want this formula
0.02%:  clearly this formula is a never
0.02%:  this formula really needs to go
0.02%:  I guess this formula does really
0.02%:  this formula is awesome and
0.02%:  clearly I should move to
0.02%:  I am fully aware
0.04%:  I am fully aware this
0.02%:  I am fully aware this sounds
0.02%:  I guess they can still
0.02%:  my advice formula lets
0.02%:  until
0.02%:  now clearly I should start
0.02%:  turns out we
0.02%:  I hate nurses!
0.02%:  so with nurses I
0.02%:  forget it! My
0.02%:  um! I guess
0.02%:  who could argue
0.02%:  my advice formula is a little rough.
0.02%:  this is all great
0.02%:  now my head is
0.03%:  now my head is full
0.02%:  my other advice formula was less
0.02%:  so clearly I have room
0.02%:  I still love my
0.02%:  this formula really can go
0.02%:  this is clearly a good formula! I
0.02%:  my last advice for nurse
0.02%:  clearly I should write out
0.02%:  shoot.
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is more
0.02%:  I seem
0.03%:  I seem to have run dry
0.03%:  I seem to have lost
0.06%:  I seem to have lost my will
0.02%:  this formula only gets worse as I
0.02%:  turns out advice is really fr
0.02%:  you win! I still
0.08%:  you win! I still have
0.03%:  you win! I still have some
0.02%:  I clearly have not
0.02%:  you win. I guess that
0.02%:  this is clearly unfair
0.02%:  clearly I must have said
0.02%:  give me a minute
0.02%:  so my advice formula is so
0.02%:  there IS
0.02%:  my formula needs serious
0.02%:  I really wanted
0.02%:  it lost
0.02%:  well shoot
0.02%:  so I guess this formula will not
0.02%:  why am
0.04%:  why am I still
0.03%:  why am I still friends
0.03%:  why am I still single
0.03%:  why am I even
0.02%:  clearly nurses have a lot to
0.02%:  so mostly this
0.16%:  so mostly this formula
0.07%:  so mostly this formula is
0.03%:  so mostly this advice
0.15%:  so mostly this advice formula
0.02%:  that one really IS awful!
0.02%:  class is over for
0.03%:  class is over for today.
0.02%:  so my new advice formula sort
0.02%:  hitting
0.02%:  I was clearly having
0.02%:  I guess this advice falls
0.02%:  this formula is secret
0.02%:  clearly this is far
0.02%:  still great advice for nurses! I
0.02%:  well I have to run
0.02%:  nurses are really awful
0.02%:  what if nurses are doctors
0.02%:  clearly I have a future writing sl
0.02%:  damn!
0.02%:  and also
0.02%:  those last ones are all
0.02%:  I guess my formula can have its
0.02%:  so my advice formula is a little won
0.02%:  these all sound awful!
0.02%:  my last advice I swear
0.02%:  this advice was really
0.02%:  I need this
0.14%:  I need this formula
0.03%:  I need this formula all
0.02%:  my last advice formula is right on
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is und
0.02%:  so I guess that was my
0.02%:  for nurses I could have
0.02%:  my last class is now
0.03%:  my last class is now over
0.02%:  my friends! I will have
0.02%:  I may have miss
0.02%:  I never said all this
0.02%:  you win. I still have some
0.02%:  so this formula is never
0.02%:  for nurses I have to say
0.02%:  that one is clearly mor
0.02%:  tell me if this
0.02%:  tell me if this sounds
0.02%:  not all my advice is useful! I
0.02%:  this formula gets really sad
0.02%:  most of those
0.02%:  clearly I have more form
0.02%:  the formula only gives us so
0.02%:  this is really cool!
0.02%:  so my formula is l
0.02%:  so this last one was clearly
0.02%:  if I could
0.02%:  this is clearly losing steam
0.02%:  I guess some advice will
0.02%:  I guess this formula really is over now
0.02%:  this one is awful. I
0.02%:  I will use this formula on
0.02%:  given
0.02%:  those sound
0.02%:  so much for all
0.06%:  so much for all nurses
0.06%:  so much for all nurses ever
0.02%:  so much for all nurses ever.
0.02%:  so the formula limits
0.02%:  I warned you!
0.02%:  clearly I love this new
0.02%:  clearly I am on
0.02%:  listen. My formula is so
0.02%:  clearly I love this more
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little narrow!
0.02%:  I call this formula
0.02%:  so I guess my final
0.06%:  so I guess my final advice
0.02%:  clearly I have some writing to do.
0.02%:  whatever! I guess my
0.22%:  whatever! I guess my formula
0.14%:  whatever! I guess my formula is
0.13%:  whatever! I guess my formula isn
0.04%:  whatever! I guess my formula can
0.03%:  whatever! I guess my formula is still
0.02%:  whatever! I guess my formula still
0.02%:  my mouth is closed forever
0.02%:  I only made
0.02%:  my formula is less good
0.04%:  my formula is less good when
0.02%:  so that one really
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS awesome!
0.02%:  this formula is clearly over and
0.02%:  my hands are full so
0.02%:  I love nurses so that
0.02%:  this is clearly an awesome
0.02%:  this was clearly less
0.03%:  this was clearly less fun
0.02%:  fine. My
0.04%:  fine. My last
0.05%:  fine. My last advice
0.02%:  this formula is all over
0.02%:  my voice is now
0.02%:  this advice formula is really mess
0.02%:  telling
0.02%:  my last advice is for them
0.02%:  so I guess my formula los
0.02%:  I guess advice
0.02%:  clearly I have more fun
0.02%:  that was really cruel
0.02%:  now my formula is over.
0.02%:  I guess my new advice formula is still a
0.02%:  I have to say it
0.02%:  so nurses have clearly got
0.02%:  this is my formula and I will
0.02%:  my new formula is so
0.02%:  so this advice formula results
0.02%:  clearly this formula is r
0.02%:  so clearly the formula IS
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets over
0.02%:  for nurses I admit
0.02%:  this formula is all wrong
0.02%:  this formula is clearly great. I wonder
0.02%:  tell you
0.04%:  tell you what!
0.03%:  tell you what.
0.02%:  using my formula was
0.02%:  so clearly I have failed
0.02%:  I will give myself this
0.02%:  will you give
0.02%:  my mouth is still
0.02%:  so I clearly should
0.02%:  you still
0.05%:  you still haven
0.02%:  clearly that was less
0.02%:  I never claimed this formula was rig
0.02%:  my advice was less
0.02%:  so much for solving all
0.02%:  so my last advice falls
0.02%:  that is an
0.05%:  that is an awful
0.02%:  not all my advice was this
0.02%:  this formula is truly never
0.02%:  I will use this formula as my
0.02%:  as much as I love using
0.02%:  whatever! I only
0.02%:  so my advice formula is ST
0.02%:  clearly I have to get
0.02%:  we should all start using my form
0.02%:  for some
0.02%:  clearly the formula is un
0.02%:  this is clearly useful!
0.02%:  so clearly I have an
0.02%:  clearly this gets more
0.05%:  clearly this gets more and
0.02%:  that one is awful. I guess
0.02%:  almost all nurses were
0.02%:  I feel weird saying
0.04%:  I feel weird saying that.
0.02%:  I hate myself now
0.02%:  guess I have
0.02%:  clearly I was using the
0.22%:  clearly I was using the formula
0.02%:  for nurses who are
0.02%:  whatever! I finally
0.02%:  that one is all yours
0.02%:  this is my favour
0.02%:  all I have left now
0.02%:  hitting myself
0.02%:  clearly I was using this
0.14%:  clearly I was using this formula to
0.02%:  this formula was clearly ME
0.02%:  my love
0.04%:  my love life has
0.02%:  leave
0.02%:  so nurses are really awful
0.02%:  so they don
0.02%:  my formula is done! I
0.02%:  this formula is mess
0.02%:  so this formula gives me
0.02%:  this formula is still good!
0.02%:  crying
0.02%:  the formula is way
0.04%:  the formula is way less
0.02%:  listen. My formula is valid
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS good
0.02%:  I still have more.
0.02%:  now that really is less
0.02%:  that was a lie
0.02%:  I can see how my formula loses its l
0.02%:  this is my first
0.02%:  clearly I am the first
0.02%:  that one is really l
0.02%:  not usually
0.02%:  my little
0.02%:  wait for
0.02%:  are we all
0.02%:  fine! I give
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little hard
0.02%:  I guess my formula is a little vers
0.02%:  I guess my advice has some
0.03%:  I guess my advice has some fl
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula may
0.02%:  so what are nurses called
0.02%:  it was a really long
0.02%:  I guess my formula covers all those
0.02%:  my new mot
0.02%:  the nurses are
0.02%:  I will never use this form
0.02%:  I love this formula and its
0.02%:  so my last advice thing
0.02%:  my first advice session
0.02%:  clearly this is done!
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was a lot
0.02%:  clearly I have to learn
0.02%:  for real this is my
0.07%:  for real this is my last advice
0.03%:  for real this is my last advice.
0.02%:  clearly this one is awful.
0.02%:  clearly nurses do a
0.02%:  we should all go
0.02%:  clearly this formula was under
0.02%:  my friends. I must leave
0.02%:  so that really
0.02%:  so clearly I have written
0.02%:  I guess this advice is only for
0.02%:  I must have missed your call
0.02%:  last one! I swear
0.02%:  I guess some advice falls
0.02%:  it was my first
0.02%:  so this formula clearly needs a
0.02%:  now my formula has lost
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is solid.
0.02%:  this formula is messing
0.02%:  I love this formula and am sorry
0.02%:  my last class was free
0.02%:  now I guess this
0.08%:  now I guess this formula
0.07%:  now I guess this formula really
0.04%:  now I guess this formula is
0.04%:  now I guess this formula really is
0.02%:  now I guess this formula really does
0.02%:  my advice to
0.36%:  my advice to nurses was
0.10%:  my advice to nurses has
0.05%:  my advice to nurses might
0.02%:  my advice to nurses is to
0.02%:  the formula loses its magic
0.02%:  clearly this is our last
0.02%:  my medical
0.02%:  listen. I was
0.02%:  my formula gets worse over
0.02%:  I confess this was
0.02%:  this formula IS very limited!
0.02%:  not all advice is for
0.02%:  I gave myself the worst
0.02%:  I have some calls to return!
0.02%:  so clearly nurses should wait
0.03%:  so clearly nurses should wait for
0.02%:  this last one really made
0.02%:  this formula is now very
0.02%:  now this advice is really
0.02%:  turns out I have really good
0.02%:  clearly this is genius
0.02%:  I guess my new formula covers
0.04%:  I guess my new formula covers all
0.02%:  it mostly
0.02%:  my last one will cover
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets weird.
0.02%:  my last advice is for snow
0.02%:  some of those
0.02%:  well. I guess this could
0.02%:  this formula seems really racist now.
0.02%:  my other advice formula will
0.02%:  my last formula is over
0.02%:  listen guys!
0.02%:  most of my advice turns
0.02%:  I should write my
0.13%:  I should write my formula
0.02%:  so I guess the advice formula will
0.02%:  whatever. I only
0.02%:  I guess my formula had its
0.02%:  I was totally serious
0.02%:  this is my last clue!
0.02%:  you had
0.04%:  you had me at nurses
0.04%:  you had me at nurses!
0.02%:  so my formula is a little rough.
0.02%:  nurses! I will
0.02%:  I grant
0.02%:  I guess my formula has sort
0.02%:  this formula really is a
0.02%:  almost all nurses do
0.02%:  I am very
0.02%:  how long
0.02%:  my formula is shallow
0.02%:  you all
0.02%:  this made
0.02%:  this will only
0.02%:  clearly this game is over. I won!
0.02%:  clearly I have n
0.02%:  my formula has issues. I
0.02%:  that one was made
0.02%:  so I clearly have a
0.02%:  this formula is really smart
0.02%:  I want to marry
0.02%:  last night was really
0.02%:  what are your
0.02%:  yeah. I guess it
0.02%:  yes this formula sounds
0.02%:  I guess we all learn
0.02%:  I will never argue
0.03%:  I will never argue that
0.02%:  we really should get
0.02%:  so this formula still needs a
0.02%:  this is awful. I
0.02%:  my new advice for
0.02%:  I deserve to
0.02%:  clearly I have some limits on
0.02%:  I guess my advice fails
0.03%:  I guess my advice fails when
0.02%:  clearly I have a gift!
0.02%:  that one is clearly over
0.02%:  my formula was less clever
0.02%:  s
0.03%:  sassy
0.02%:  forget nurses! I should
0.02%:  clearly this formula is ri
0.02%:  my last advice is for rom
0.02%:  so nurses are evil.
0.02%:  the formula is truly
0.02%:  my hands are still
0.02%:  clearly this formula is gross.
0.02%:  it was really hard not
0.02%:  I clearly got
0.02%:  so I guess this advice will
0.02%:  I guess that was all
0.02%:  I guess my formula is valid!
0.02%:  so that one is clearly less
0.02%:  I must now
0.02%:  um. I should
0.02%:  listen. I have to
0.02%:  I guess the formula is clearly
0.02%:  forcing this
0.02%:  this formula sounds more evil
0.02%:  clearly this formula is worse as
0.02%:  so my advice is useful
0.02%:  will this
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are S
0.02%:  my formula can solve
0.02%:  this new formula really is great.
0.02%:  clearly this formula was T
0.02%:  so clearly this is now
0.02%:  this formula IS very limited.
0.02%:  this formula is clearly a monster
0.02%:  clearly this went from
0.02%:  this advice is mostly awful!
0.02%:  now I totally have
0.02%:  I never said all my formula
0.02%:  my last advice formula wins!
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is so
0.02%:  that was really clever.
0.02%:  my advice formula has issues. I
0.02%:  hardly
0.02%:  this one was mostly
0.02%:  so clearly I have more formula
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is golden
0.02%:  clearly this formula is never E
0.02%:  this advice formula is really gross now!
0.02%:  now your
0.02%:  this is a really long
0.02%:  so much for last
0.02%:  who gives
0.02%:  whatever! I still rule
0.02%:  that one is awful advice
0.02%:  so clearly nurses would rather go
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is hor
0.02%:  that sounds really awful! I give
0.02%:  that does
0.02%:  not all the ver
0.02%:  all of these
0.02%:  I will grant you this is
0.02%:  so I lied!
0.02%:  so this formula is largely
0.02%:  I guess my formula hits all
0.02%:  I still have no clue
0.02%:  I guess my formula is as
0.02%:  clearly there is a flaw
0.02%:  so my advice formula writes
0.02%:  my last advice lesson for
0.02%:  my new formula leaves
0.02%:  so my advice formula is thus
0.02%:  I never claimed this was for
0.02%:  frig that one
0.03%:  frig that one was really
0.02%:  now my advice is all
0.02%:  my last formula sounds a
0.02%:  my formula is less vers
0.02%:  clearly I have some soul
0.02%:  guess who is
0.02%:  clearly the last answer
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets used
0.02%:  I should really go start
0.02%:  this advice is not really
0.02%:  who can guess my last
0.02%:  so I clearly have limits
0.02%:  I guess it wasn
0.02%:  I guess my formula is a little won
0.02%:  so all nurses are evil!
0.02%:  this formula is great! I never
0.02%:  never call me to
0.02%:  now this advice formula really is
0.02%:  for nurses that was my
0.02%:  this formula is clearly wrong.
0.02%:  my last class has
0.02%:  that advice formula is worse
0.02%:  so this is my formula
0.02%:  clearly I win forever
0.02%:  my new advice formula is a little rough.
0.02%:  now all my
0.05%:  now all my advice
0.02%:  I admit it! My formula covers all
0.02%:  every other
0.02%:  I would still rather
0.02%:  and I guess
0.02%:  some of my answers
0.02%:  not every formula was stellar
0.02%:  turns out I have a really
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was real
0.02%:  my last words on earth
0.02%:  this formula sounds way racist
0.02%:  I should really start over
0.02%:  my source
0.02%:  my friends. I will leave
0.02%:  my real last words
0.02%:  I give you full
0.02%:  this formula is sorta
0.02%:  my last advice is for all nurses to
0.02%:  my source for
0.05%:  my source for this was
0.04%:  my source for this last
0.02%:  I guess the moral
0.02%:  that was really less
0.02%:  so my formula is all
0.02%:  my last thing is for
0.02%:  I never said my formula was SEEM
0.02%:  this formula can use
0.02%:  I will go
0.02%:  so I guess the formula was
0.02%:  my advice formula is a lot
0.07%:  my advice formula is a lot less
0.02%:  my friends. I leave
0.02%:  why is
0.02%:  this all seems
0.02%:  my other formula is still
0.02%:  I am clearly using this formula.
0.02%:  my last round is free.
0.02%:  this formula is really unc
0.02%:  this new advice formula is a
0.02%:  so they nurse
0.02%:  as I
0.03%:  as I recall
0.03%:  as I recall nurses
0.02%:  time for us
0.02%:  clearly nurses are T
0.02%:  this formula is un
0.02%:  clearly I have now master
0.02%:  my advice formula has DE
0.02%:  clearly the formula is moving
0.11%:  clearly the formula is moving towards
0.02%:  this formula is clearly 
0.02%:  so I could really
0.02%:  that one was cl
0.06%:  that one was clumsy!
0.03%:  that one was clumsy. I
0.02%:  listen! I am
0.02%:  listen! I am clearly
0.02%:  nurses you
0.02%:  and for
0.02%:  so my advice formula is SE
0.02%:  my advice formula runs a
0.02%:  my formula sounds worse as it
0.02%:  this reminds me!
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula also
0.02%:  I clearly have a lot more
0.02%:  yes this formula does
0.02%:  my formula is genius!
0.02%:  it sounds really mor
0.02%:  clearly this is a never
0.02%:  my last will
0.02%:  I guess this formula really comes
0.06%:  I guess this formula really comes down
0.02%:  so clearly this must
0.02%:  I have run out of ideas
0.02%:  this advice IS really
0.02%:  it turned
0.02%:  as much as I love it
0.02%:  I will never forget this class!
0.02%:  my formula is great! I will
0.02%:  I guess you had
0.02%:  so there are limits.
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is meant
0.02%:  writing myself
0.02%:  turns out all my advice is self
0.02%:  even for
0.02%:  you can do
0.05%:  you can do this
0.02%:  almost all nurses I
0.02%:  so clearly this formula under
0.02%:  so my advice still has
0.02%:  I really have to find
0.02%:  now I am clearly
0.02%:  well! I guess this is my
0.02%:  this formula is clearly named
0.02%:  clearly I would rather
0.02%:  I guess the formula covers
0.03%:  I guess the formula covers all
0.02%:  clearly I should start forming
0.02%:  so clearly this formula gets worse in
0.02%:  this formula is now less
0.02%:  my formula is a little over
0.02%:  my last words.
0.02%:  so much for living
0.02%:  well! I can
0.02%:  my last great formula
0.02%:  this is my last advice formula. IT
0.02%:  I never said it was P
0.02%:  forget all my answers
0.02%:  I rest
0.14%:  I rest my case.
0.02%:  SEE what
0.02%:  clearly I have ruined
0.02%:  all credit to
0.02%:  my last advice is for ner
0.02%:  I can do this forever. T
0.02%:  so they all
0.02%:  so they all sound
0.02%:  I wish nurses
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly genius!
0.02%:  this formula was clearly under
0.02%:  well I guess this advice formula is not
0.02%:  and with
0.02%:  this last one would
0.02%:  I guess my formula is in
0.02%:  my last clue is this
0.02%:  this formula is E
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS over
0.02%:  so the formula runs dry at
0.02%:  not all my advice is the
0.02%:  so my formula has turned
0.02%:  my formula is trash
0.02%:  my formula is less and
0.02%:  using this formula was clearly
0.02%:  I am finally
0.02%:  this formula is clearly as strong
0.02%:  last one for this
0.02%:  all I have to
0.02%:  all I have to say
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets more sur
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little weird
0.02%:  love
0.02%:  final try
0.02%:  clearly this formula is not used
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is smart
0.02%:  my formula is useless now!
0.02%:  my last formula ever!
0.02%:  I never said my formula was s
0.02%:  so this advice may
0.02%:  my last formula should cover it
0.02%:  so this advice formula is really strong. I
0.02%:  well I guess if
0.02%:  my last advice formula is nurses
0.02%:  some of my advice has
0.02%:  I really should use
0.02%:  using my formula this
0.02%:  so my advice is less than
0.02%:  my last call for
0.02%:  the formula only lasts so
0.02%:  so that was really gross.
0.02%:  my new advice formula has issues
0.02%:  my new advice formula has issues!
0.02%:  I guess the formula is really not
0.02%:  my friends! I have come
0.02%:  I guess this formula really covers a
0.02%:  so clearly I wouldn
0.02%:  clearly this is a formula I need
0.02%:  this was meant
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little harder
0.02%:  clearly this formula is mat
0.02%:  my last advice is for all other
0.02%:  very good!
0.02%:  should we
0.02%:  the formula is clearly in
0.02%:  they were all sort
0.02%:  this formula was sort
0.02%:  that was so
0.02%:  my advice is useless
0.02%:  that one does
0.02%:  so I guess it can
0.02%:  I never claimed this formula was D
0.02%:  my advice formula was so
0.02%:  I have written all
0.02%:  mainly
0.02%:  I love nurses so that was
0.02%:  this was really fun so
0.02%:  clearly I win at this.
0.02%:  so clearly nurses should t
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is legit and
0.02%:  so nurses will hate
0.02%:  my formula has its down
0.02%:  wait. I have
0.02%:  my last free advice will
0.02%:  this formula could easily get
0.02%:  this is clearly awesome and
0.02%:  I figured that was
0.02%:  my last version for
0.02%:  the last one was really for
0.02%:  my future
0.02%:  clearly this formula is doing w
0.02%:  this is my last advice for a
0.09%:  this is my last advice for a long
0.02%:  my advice formula is that
0.02%:  whatever. I finally
0.02%:  that was an error
0.02%:  so I guess the advice formula still
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is worst
0.02%:  this formula is great! I will use
0.02%:  who cares!
0.02%:  my last one is for writers!
0.02%:  my new formula is clear
0.02%:  my last formula here
0.02%:  listen! I have a
0.02%:  using my formula there
0.02%:  I have clearly won at
0.02%:  yeah. I could
0.02%:  I lost myself there a
0.02%:  I admit it. My
0.37%:  I admit it. My formula
0.13%:  I admit it. My formula runs
0.07%:  I admit it. My formula has
0.05%:  I admit it. My formula isn
0.02%:  I guess my first advice was the
0.02%:  you can have it!
0.02%:  there really is a formula
0.02%:  this really seems
0.02%:  whatever! I still say
0.02%:  this formula is still way
0.03%:  this formula is still way more
0.02%:  I lost my voice from
0.03%:  I lost my voice from all
0.06%:  I lost my voice from all this
0.02%:  I should really get on
0.02%:  now that is less
0.02%:  game
0.07%:  game over.
0.03%:  game over! I
0.03%:  game over. I
0.02%:  I swear this formula is never
0.02%:  my last advice for nurses is how
0.02%:  I deserve a salary for coming
0.02%:  so clearly the words
0.02%:  so nurses are victims
0.02%:  sorry for not
0.02%:  my reward
0.06%:  my reward for coming
0.03%:  my reward for solving
0.06%:  my reward for solving this
0.02%:  my reward for solving all
0.02%:  clearly I got this!
0.02%:  this formula was clearly do
0.02%:  I will listen
0.02%:  now my advice formula is sort
0.02%:  this formula is clearly end
0.02%:  I could go forever!
0.02%:  screw you if
0.02%:  my last formula is secret
0.02%:  my last hour is
0.03%:  my last hour is over
0.02%:  last one for you!
0.02%:  my new formula is great.
0.02%:  I was really having
0.02%:  that one is way less fl
0.02%:  this is my new career.
0.02%:  this goes on forever!
0.02%:  umm
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is that
0.02%:  this formula gets a
0.02%:  I will never use this formula as my
0.02%:  whatever. My final
0.02%:  nurses are really sad
0.02%:  it loses its charm!
0.02%:  are you still
0.02%:  my heart is racing from stress
0.02%:  I am really glad
0.02%:  my new advice formula gets
0.02%:  that one IS awful!
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is what
0.02%:  I admit it! My formula gives
0.02%:  I seem to have run dry!
0.02%:  if you want more
0.02%:  no this last
0.02%:  so this advice formula really is
0.02%:  so clearly I was meant
0.02%:  my last formula was stolen
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is well
0.02%:  that one was over
0.02%:  clearly this formula sounds great.
0.02%:  I guess it has
0.02%:  that was a gross one!
0.02%:  well um
0.02%:  my last advice formula is here
0.02%:  so I clearly don
0.02%:  listen! My advice formula is so
0.02%:  so the formula sounds great
0.02%:  I never said it was logical
0.02%:  so my advice formula is great! I
0.02%:  clearly nurses are awful!
0.02%:  whatever my
0.02%:  so this formula really IS
0.02%:  guess nurses
0.02%:  you tried
0.02%:  forget nurses. I love
0.02%:  I love nurses so that was really
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is strong. I
0.02%:  clearly the formula is not vers
0.02%:  no really I
0.02%:  I have some writing to do.
0.02%:  my last one is self
0.02%:  this new advice formula is all
0.02%:  if we could
0.02%:  I clearly win this game!
0.02%:  friends! I have clearly
0.02%:  my last advice formula wins.
0.02%:  clearly the formula is too vers
0.02%:  that was cr
0.02%:  may
0.04%:  may I remind
0.02%:  clearly from
0.02%:  this is way less clever
0.02%:  this formula got really weird.
0.02%:  my formula can get
0.02%:  last try for
0.02%:  my final words are to
0.02%:  for nurses that is
0.02%:  my advice formula loses when
0.02%:  clearly I won that
0.02%:  so that advice was
0.02%:  I guess this last one really
0.02%:  I guess this formula is very narrow!
0.02%:  my formula is an
0.02%:  I guess all my
0.04%:  I guess all my friends
0.04%:  I guess all my advice
0.02%:  I guess all my advice turns
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly great. I
0.02%:  I draw
0.02%:  glad
0.02%:  my advice for nurses who are also
0.02%:  clearly I never said this formula is gr
0.02%:  so my formula is generic
0.02%:  clearly I should give a
0.02%:  not all my advice formula is
0.02%:  that was gross. My final
0.02%:  this formula is very general
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is still great
0.02%:  forget this! My
0.03%:  forget this! My advice
0.02%:  you should still give
0.02%:  enough! My advice formula still
0.02%:  this formula may not solve
0.02%:  clearly this needs a
0.02%:  clearly nurses are far
0.02%:  my advice formula is M
0.02%:  so this last one really
0.02%:  I have clearly won!
0.02%:  this last one was largely
0.02%:  so my last advice for this
0.02%:  over.
0.02%:  this game is clearly over! I won
0.02%:  I admit it. My formula can
0.02%:  my last line is
0.02%:  this was all a
0.02%:  nurses! I guess that
0.02%:  my formula is still genius
0.02%:  the formula is clearly sound
0.02%:  this is awesome. I
0.02%:  my formula can do
0.02%:  clearly I was meant for more
0.02%:  so nurses should wear
0.02%:  this lasted
0.02%:  the last one was forced!
0.02%:  the formula is missing
0.02%:  this class is over! I
0.02%:  now I have some
0.02%:  clearly nurses are good
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of real
0.14%:  I have clearly run out of real words
0.05%:  I have clearly run out of real words.
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of real words!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is nowhere
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is D
0.02%:  so my formula does still have its
0.02%:  for nurses I guess it
0.02%:  this formula gets me really
0.02%:  I really should go start
0.02%:  clearly I should revisit
0.02%:  I guess whatever you
0.02%:  my last advice is to all nurses
0.02%:  my last advice is to all nurses who
0.02%:  my shift is almost
0.21%:  my shift is almost over!
0.13%:  my shift is almost over.
0.06%:  my shift is almost over and
0.05%:  my shift is almost over. I
0.04%:  my shift is almost over! I
0.02%:  and um
0.02%:  this formula runs dry over
0.02%:  clearly this formula is ret
0.02%:  this met
0.02%:  that one is awful sorry
0.02%:  using this formula I was
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is dest
0.02%:  my last advice was free.
0.02%:  so clearly this forum
0.02%:  my formula has now served us
0.02%:  so the last advice formula
0.02%:  screw you all.
0.02%:  my secret is out.
0.02%:  so my formula can use
0.02%:  I guess my last failure as
0.02%:  my advice formula IS sort
0.02%:  so my advice formula has gotten less
0.02%:  this formula needs less
0.02%:  so I guess my formula has certain
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is great!
0.02%:  so I guess my overall
0.04%:  so I guess my overall formula
0.02%:  my last advice refers
0.02%:  you should start coming
0.02%:  so clearly the reason
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is all right
0.02%:  this is me
0.02%:  my formula runs short
0.02%:  so I guess the formula really can
0.02%:  this one is really gross!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is DEEP and
0.02%:  well. I guess it turns
0.02%:  my last advice is for horror
0.02%:  my reward for solving that
0.02%:  this formula is less great
0.02%:  sorry that one was gross
0.02%:  my last advice is for no
0.02%:  not all of them are classy.
0.02%:  this was a fun game
0.02%:  I guess we should totally
0.02%:  my last advice is for things
0.02%:  so I still might
0.02%:  all this advice was
0.02%:  my last advice is for men.
0.02%:  now I get it!
0.02%:  this is for nurses
0.02%:  now my advice for
0.02%:  whatever man! My formula is still good.
0.02%:  nurses are hard to give
0.02%:  I can see how you
0.02%:  so clearly this formula was dest
0.02%:  using that
0.23%:  using that formula
0.03%:  using that formula I clearly
0.03%:  using that formula I will
0.02%:  this all got
0.02%:  nuts
0.02%:  I never said my formula was DEEP!
0.02%:  this formula IS really strong
0.02%:  enough from
0.02%:  now I am really scared
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is vast
0.02%:  so clearly I should turn
0.02%:  I can tell this formula is very
0.02%:  I guess they wouldn
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula is T
0.02%:  my advice formula is now the
0.02%:  my mind was
0.02%:  so nurses are clearly awful
0.02%:  so there is a small
0.02%:  my formula does sort
0.02%:  now hurry
0.02%:  closing the
0.02%:  yes. I could
0.02%:  using that formula is
0.05%:  using that formula is clearly
0.02%:  my formula is less clever now
0.02%:  clearly this formula gives us tons
0.02%:  listen. I have some
0.02%:  why am I doing
0.02%:  I guess my formula stands
0.02%:  not really sure this formula was
0.02%:  my other advice formula is to
0.02%:  clearly I am moving
0.02%:  clearly I am moving towards
0.02%:  clearly I am moving forward
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS a
0.02%:  I finally see what
0.02%:  so clearly I have a long
0.02%:  I have one
0.02%:  I still have a long career
0.02%:  sorry if this
0.02%:  clearly this formula is set
0.02%:  I guess nurses will hate
0.02%:  turns out my advice form is
0.02%:  what are you still
0.02%:  my advice formula M
0.02%:  so this formula still doesn
0.02%:  my last advice won
0.02%:  clearly I win!
0.02%:  so my last failure wasn
0.02%:  these are mostly
0.03%:  these are mostly awful
0.02%:  I love this formula. My last
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was a little sl
0.02%:  it loses its charm under
0.02%:  this one falls
0.02%:  forget it! I have
0.03%:  forget it! I have clearly
0.02%:  forget it! I have clearly run
0.02%:  that was one for
0.02%:  this formula is truly endless! I
0.02%:  i
0.02%:  that sounds gross. I will
0.02%:  I am T
0.02%:  credit for the
0.02%:  all these sound
0.02%:  clearly nurses have it T
0.02%:  so this could really
0.02%:  my last dollar is on whatever
0.02%:  clearly we should turn
0.02%:  my last formula ends
0.03%:  my last formula ends with
0.02%:  so clearly I have not figured
0.02%:  clearly this formula is wasted on us!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over! I must
0.02%:  so I guess this formula may
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets worse!
0.02%:  my new focus
0.02%:  I guess that one is clearly awful
0.02%:  so clearly the real
0.02%:  I clearly have no limits
0.02%:  I still have many more!
0.02%:  not all advice forms
0.02%:  so even
0.02%:  new advice formula alert
0.02%:  I should ST
0.02%:  whatever! My formula could
0.02%:  enough advice.
0.02%:  listen. My formula covers the
0.02%:  this formula was so
0.02%:  really I have
0.02%:  so I could still
0.02%:  I guess my formula shows
0.02%:  my ears hurt.
0.02%:  I can write this forever!
0.02%:  my advice formula is not the
0.02%:  so I had
0.02%:  now I am really tired
0.02%:  I give myself a million stars!
0.02%:  my last dollar from
0.03%:  my last dollar from this
0.02%:  I guess my advice follows
0.02%:  so this formula is really strong.
0.02%:  the last one was l
0.02%:  so clearly nurses do what
0.02%:  I guess all the
0.02%:  so my formula rel
0.02%:  who are you calling
0.02%:  I guess this is all very clear
0.02%:  I guess this is all very clear now!
0.02%:  all out of nurses right
0.02%:  I almost
0.02%:  so this formula clearly gets worse
0.02%:  my doctor
0.02%:  the formula is clear.
0.02%:  let us never discuss my
0.02%:  you caught me! I still don
0.02%:  for some reason this
0.02%:  I should try
0.02%:  I can tell this formula was
0.02%:  turns out I was already
0.02%:  not every word is
0.02%:  so my formula was a
0.02%:  this ends
0.02%:  so my formula will not
0.02%:  so my final words
0.02%:  this new formula is mostly
0.02%:  so this only
0.02%:  sounds less
0.02%:  clearly this one is flaw
0.02%:  love nurses
0.02%:  I will admit.
0.02%:  I will say this last
0.02%:  this formula is way less clever and
0.02%:  I guess my new advice is
0.02%:  so my advice formula uses
0.02%:  I guess the formula sort
0.02%:  my last four
0.02%:  this formula is well
0.02%:  clearly animals
0.02%:  so really this advice
0.25%:  so really this advice formula
0.04%:  so really this advice formula isn
0.04%:  so really this advice formula turns
0.03%:  so really this advice formula is more
0.02%:  not really sure what a
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over. I guess
0.02%:  so my friends are
0.03%:  so my friends are all
0.02%:  I guess my formula has lots
0.02%:  unless that
0.02%:  clearly nurses do more harm
0.02%:  this is my formula and I love
0.02%:  forget nurses. I would
0.05%:  forget nurses. I would rather
0.02%:  I never said my formula is great!
0.02%:  I guess this ends our
0.02%:  so my last advice formula here
0.02%:  this formula does still
0.02%:  I sense
0.02%:  my last formula ever is this
0.02%:  the formula is really over
0.02%:  I will say this formula doesn
0.02%:  my formula is done with
0.02%:  now this formula really seems
0.02%:  my advice for all
0.22%:  my advice for all nurses is that
0.11%:  my advice for all nurses is to
0.10%:  my advice for all nurses is this
0.03%:  my advice for all nurses was
0.02%:  I can see why all
0.02%:  the formula is limited
0.02%:  after having
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is ver
0.02%:  I never said the form
0.02%:  time for this
0.02%:  my last advice is for nurses who tell
0.02%:  I guess not
0.21%:  I guess not all advice
0.05%:  I guess not all advice is worth
0.05%:  I guess not every
0.08%:  I guess not every formula
0.15%:  I guess not every formula will
0.05%:  I guess not every formula is
0.04%:  I guess not all ver
0.04%:  I guess not all my
0.08%:  I guess not all my advice formula
0.03%:  I guess not all my advice is worth
0.03%:  I guess not all my advice is as
0.02%:  I guess not all my advice is so
0.02%:  I guess not all my form
0.02%:  I guess not all my formula
0.02%:  clearly I should move from
0.02%:  this one is clearly for
0.02%:  my advice formula will get
0.02%:  you get it
0.03%:  you get it!
0.02%:  I guess my formula is so
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is DE
0.02%:  yes I guess
0.02%:  so this advice formula only last
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula DE
0.02%:  my name
0.02%:  I guess my career
0.02%:  for nurses that was more
0.02%:  yes. I will have
0.02%:  my last advice formula wins this
0.02%:  so my formula still has its draw
0.02%:  my formula got weird there.
0.02%:  I will give that
0.02%:  so my advice is still awful
0.02%:  my last four advice
0.02%:  clearly this formula is sm
0.02%:  so my formula still gets
0.02%:  forget this is
0.02%:  my last advice formula is right now
0.02%:  I guess my mind
0.02%:  I really was
0.02%:  you must admit
0.02%:  this last one was made
0.02%:  we can do
0.40%:  we can do this forever
0.27%:  we can do this forever!
0.05%:  we can do this forever. I
0.03%:  we can do this all D
0.02%:  we can do this for
0.02%:  for nurses that advice
0.02%:  now the last
0.02%:  I forgot nurses are already
0.02%:  nurses have a really
0.02%:  this is clearly over and
0.02%:  no more. My formula has served
0.02%:  this sort
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is DE
0.02%:  I would rather nurses
0.02%:  my last formula has got
0.02%:  this formula is golden
0.02%:  this formula is golden!
0.02%:  this is clearly over now. I
0.02%:  so I never claimed this formula is
0.02%:  this formula does not always give us
0.02%:  so the first one was clearly
0.02%:  I love nurses so much!
0.02%:  turns out advice really
0.02%:  clearly this formula is SET
0.02%:  the last answer
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is trash
0.02%:  so this formula is really great. I
0.02%:  I guess the formula is over!
0.02%:  I gotta call
0.02%:  my formula will never get
0.02%:  fine. I guess this
0.02%:  this was really good
0.05%:  this was really good until
0.02%:  I have some more
0.02%:  forget nurses. I already
0.02%:  this formula clearly gets worse as I run
0.02%:  my advice for nurses rules
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is the worst I
0.02%:  could we
0.02%:  forget nurses! I will
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula lets
0.02%:  so the formula is clear.
0.02%:  so nurses are mostly
0.02%:  I want this advice
0.07%:  I want this advice formula
0.02%:  I guess this formula is D
0.02%:  now you have to admit
0.02%:  my mouth was
0.02%:  that one was clearly evil
0.02%:  I have learned
0.02%:  my formula has turned racist
0.02%:  my advice has gone
0.04%:  my advice has gone from
0.02%:  clearly I should write songs.
0.02%:  this last one is really good. I
0.02%:  I still love my friends
0.02%:  no worries! I have
0.02%:  the advice
0.02%:  I am clearly losing at
0.07%:  I am clearly losing at this.
0.03%:  I am clearly losing at this!
0.02%:  my advice formula is so great I
0.02%:  my failure
0.02%:  it IS
0.02%:  mission
0.02%:  my advice formula is ins
0.02%:  this was only
0.02%:  moving away from such
0.02%:  this was even
0.02%:  I guess whatever.
0.02%:  you win for most clever
0.02%:  I guess this sort
0.03%:  I guess this sort of advice
0.04%:  I guess this sort of advice really
0.02%:  I guess this sort of advice only
0.02%:  the formula only goes
0.02%:  try again
0.02%:  this was all fun
0.02%:  listen. I am really
0.02%:  I guess some advice isn
0.02%:  my last advice for a nurse will
0.02%:  yours were
0.02%:  this formula IS a
0.02%:  nurses are hard for
0.02%:  that one mess
0.02%:  my formula is a little worse
0.02%:  that advice is wrong
0.02%:  I guess this really is over now
0.02%:  now I really regret
0.02%:  now I really regret this
0.07%:  now I really regret this formula
0.02%:  now I really regret this formula!
0.02%:  clearly this is not for real
0.02%:  the formula can really
0.02%:  yes I admit
0.02%:  so the only
0.02%:  my formula is solved
0.02%:  so my formula is the worst ever.
0.02%:  we should really start forming
0.02%:  actual nurses are very
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice formula hasn
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice is for
0.02%:  this was great.
0.02%:  I love myself!
0.02%:  my new advice formula has got
0.02%:  I swear this formula really
0.02%:  not my fault
0.02%:  my last advice form was
0.02%:  so my last advice follows
0.02%:  I admit it. My formula covers
0.02%:  clearly this is as useful
0.02%:  story
0.02%:  my formula got weird.
0.02%:  clearly this formula is more genius
0.02%:  so my formula covers all nurses
0.02%:  my mind is full. I
0.02%:  so listen. I have
0.02%:  I already have nurses
0.02%:  this formula is really sound
0.02%:  can I have
0.02%:  that one was for me
0.02%:  you caught me. I made
0.02%:  my advice is for nurses who also
0.02%:  my formula is losing its l
0.02%:  my fellow nurses.
0.02%:  this last one IS clearly
0.02%:  so this turned
0.02%:  this is all very good
0.02%:  this formula was clearly DEST
0.02%:  this formula is really more vers
0.02%:  I never said my formula is great.
0.02%:  that one was less clearly
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was hor
0.02%:  this is my last formula. I don
0.02%:  so my formula is T
0.02%:  I love them
0.03%:  I love them all
0.02%:  last call for words
0.02%:  so I guess my formula covers a
0.02%:  last resort
0.02%:  so my formula was sort
0.02%:  my formula has now lost
0.02%:  I guess my new advice formula is all
0.02%:  it gets harder for
0.02%:  it gets harder for nurses
0.02%:  so in summary I
0.02%:  so in summary I have
0.02%:  so in summary I guess
0.02%:  I guess my formula does cover
0.05%:  I guess my formula does cover all
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is the most
0.02%:  sorry for all these
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is word
0.02%:  we need
0.02%:  clearly this formula is nuts!
0.02%:  I can SEE this
0.02%:  I can SEE this formula
0.02%:  so the formula is cl
0.02%:  listen! I will
0.02%:  I will leave you
0.02%:  so that one is really awful
0.02%:  now this formula is really mess
0.02%:  clearly this formula sounds awesome.
0.02%:  my last dollar has
0.02%:  this could use
0.02%:  it gets really hard now
0.02%:  my last formula could
0.02%:  my new advice formula sure
0.02%:  I guess this was a failure
0.02%:  well I guess that advice
0.08%:  well I guess that advice formula
0.04%:  well I guess that advice formula isn
0.03%:  well I guess that advice formula is
0.02%:  I may have st
0.02%:  never heard
0.02%:  I never said this formula is P
0.02%:  my new advice formula is also
0.02%:  I call it
0.02%:  my new formula should cover
0.02%:  I guess my version
0.02%:  who says I can
0.02%:  my advice formula grows st
0.02%:  clearly I have no limits!
0.02%:  so really this formula is more
0.02%:  I will give you the
0.05%:  I will give you the formula
0.02%:  I will give you the last
0.02%:  this is my last advice formula. T
0.02%:  those are all awful.
0.02%:  now I guess this formula is really
0.02%:  this formula can get weird really
0.02%:  I guess my last words
0.02%:  can we start
0.02%:  so clearly the word
0.02%:  yours are
0.02%:  I guess this was fun.
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly meant
0.02%:  this formula could never go
0.02%:  not always the
0.02%:  I should start using my
0.02%:  those last few all
0.03%:  those last few all sound
0.02%:  again
0.02%:  my last advice is for wh
0.03%:  my last advice is for whales
0.02%:  so clearly it has limits
0.02%:  so clearly it has limits!
0.02%:  and my
0.03%:  and my last
0.02%:  my formula is over. I will
0.02%:  so clearly I should never start
0.02%:  this was clearly a good
0.02%:  so the formula always
0.03%:  so the formula always results
0.02%:  so clearly I was under
0.02%:  two
0.06%:  two things!
0.04%:  two things.
0.02%:  wo
0.02%:  whatever. My formula remains
0.02%:  my last great advice
0.02%:  well I don
0.02%:  I am now fully
0.02%:  my last advice there
0.02%:  so I guess my form
0.02%:  so I guess my final words
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is still a
0.02%:  I can see how my formula still
0.02%:  so the advice formula really
0.02%:  all I have left is my
0.02%:  this formula can write
0.02%:  this formula is w
0.02%:  clearly this formula is used wrong
0.02%:  so my new sl
0.02%:  so my advice formula is ins
0.02%:  I guess my last advice forum was
0.02%:  clearly nurses have got to
0.02%:  this new formula is very
0.02%:  whatever! My formula remains
0.02%:  my last answer for the record
0.02%:  I guess this is finally
0.03%:  I guess this is finally over
0.02%:  I guess this is finally over!
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula is DE
0.02%:  my last advice formula is tough
0.02%:  this new advice formula I
0.02%:  my last life
0.05%:  my last life lesson
0.02%:  so I can see
0.06%:  so I can see why
0.02%:  last night I
0.02%:  my formula is not so
0.02%:  nurses! I have failed
0.02%:  that sounds worse for
0.02%:  after hearing my
0.03%:  after hearing my advice I
0.02%:  I never said this formula will get
0.02%:  I guess the formula is more
0.02%:  so for nurses I should
0.02%:  enough already. I
0.02%:  clearly nurses have it so
0.02%:  this formula is clearly great now
0.02%:  that one is full
0.02%:  that was rude
0.02%:  my advice formula is nowhere
0.02%:  I should really start using more ver
0.02%:  I lost myself with
0.02%:  my advice for nurses with
0.02%:  my formula has gotten less
0.02%:  well. I guess my advice formula is not as
0.02%:  this is my last answer ever
0.02%:  I will give this formula to
0.02%:  I will give this formula to nurses
0.02%:  clearly I should write some fr
0.02%:  it got weird.
0.02%:  I am leaving
0.02%:  after this I will never say
0.02%:  I give in.
0.02%:  you should see
0.02%:  for all
0.02%:  so the ver
0.02%:  reality
0.02%:  clearly I have talent
0.02%:  I could listen
0.03%:  I could listen to myself
0.02%:  that one was lame!
0.02%:  this formula will save us
0.02%:  I have a few
0.02%:  is there any
0.02%:  I found that
0.02%:  so this is all I
0.02%:  forget it! I will
0.02%:  my new advice formula also
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula has more
0.02%:  I never claimed it was all
0.02%:  this is my last round.
0.02%:  so clearly I have limits.
0.02%:  so it gets less
0.02%:  my advice is useful
0.02%:  for nurses this advice was
0.02%:  I must have mis
0.02%:  so clearly this formula and its
0.02%:  so the nurses formula was
0.02%:  my last advice is for nurses who are P
0.02%:  so there you
0.02%:  my last advice is for all these
0.02%:  what if I said nurses are
0.02%:  clearly this got weird
0.02%:  clearly this was more fun to
0.02%:  clearly I now
0.02%:  I guess this formula was only valid
0.02%:  the last one is my
0.02%:  I guess my advice still has
0.02%:  clearly I was over
0.02%:  clearly this formula is v
0.03%:  clearly this formula is vagu
0.02%:  you can still hear me!
0.02%:  so this formula clearly needs to
0.02%:  my last answer is for doctors
0.02%:  so most of my
0.03%:  so most of my advice turns
0.02%:  so most of my advice will
0.02%:  so the formula IS really
0.02%:  my last advice is for hom
0.02%:  forget I said this
0.02%:  I guess this was all a
0.02%:  you got me. I was
0.02%:  this is all I could
0.02%:  so what you
0.02%:  clearly this formula is never a
0.02%:  I guess my formula is done.
0.02%:  whatever. My formula sounds great!
0.02%:  this advice is almost
0.02%:  sounds legit
0.02%:  so clearly this formula wants
0.02%:  it clearly gets harder from
0.02%:  so only
0.02%:  this formula runs dry. I
0.02%:  so my advice has limits
0.02%:  so my advice has limits!
0.02%:  so not all my advice rules
0.02%:  clearly this formula is god
0.02%:  clearly the formula is as
0.03%:  clearly the formula is as strong
0.02%:  I will end myself right
0.02%:  those last four are
0.03%:  those last four are clearly
0.02%:  this formula is so great I could
0.02%:  this formula is so great I could never
0.02%:  clearly I love nurses right
0.02%:  this formula can get really weird!
0.02%:  this advice formula only gets worse as I
0.02%:  this is clearly sur
0.04%:  this is clearly surreal now
0.02%:  I guess you were
0.02%:  forget this. I clearly don
0.02%:  this is clearly over for me!
0.02%:  now the formula is clearly over
0.02%:  so as
0.02%:  my last advice is for us all.
0.02%:  this formula is great. I never
0.02%:  this new formula IS
0.02%:  this formula is truly awesome. I
0.02%:  my last advice is for all things.
0.02%:  this gets us
0.02%:  true story!
0.02%:  so this form
0.02%:  give me another
0.02%:  my last words on this are
0.02%:  this class is over and
0.02%:  now my advice formula is the
0.02%:  my formula runs a
0.02%:  my formula runs a little weird
0.02%:  my last version is called
0.02%:  this new formula is so
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are hurt
0.02%:  come on guys.
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is a ground
0.02%:  so clearly I win.
0.02%:  this formula is awesome. I love
0.02%:  this sounds really mor
0.02%:  my last advice is for ut
0.02%:  it hasn
0.02%:  so this formula gives really
0.02%:  enough! My formula is valid
0.02%:  I clearly have some writing
0.02%:  this formula is really good. I never
0.02%:  so that is
0.02%:  so that is clearly
0.02%:  we should totally give
0.02%:  my formula has an error
0.02%:  so much for nurses! My
0.02%:  such
0.02%:  I admit it wasn
0.02%:  so this last one is really
0.02%:  screw you all forever!
0.02%:  now this last advice
0.03%:  now this last advice formula
0.02%:  you can see how
0.02%:  so I was totally
0.02%:  doesn
0.02%:  this advice is less
0.02%:  well I guess my advice formula is not as
0.02%:  so my advice formula is real
0.02%:  clearly this gets us
0.02%:  so my advice formula is an
0.02%:  my last advice forms
0.02%:  I guess my formula is the
0.03%:  I guess my formula is the worst
0.03%:  I guess my formula is the worst advice
0.02%:  whatever man. My formula rules
0.02%:  my real advice is that
0.05%:  my real advice is that nurses
0.02%:  so my formula is worth
0.02%:  that one usually
0.02%:  my advice has run out for
0.02%:  this new formula leaves
0.02%:  so I made
0.02%:  this last one was clearly for
0.02%:  I shall
0.02%:  I forgot nurses are mostly
0.02%:  I guess that formula
0.02%:  clearly nurses do more for
0.02%:  I guess the formula is limited.
0.02%:  I throw myself on
0.02%:  well! I guess that is
0.02%:  nurses have it real
0.02%:  my advice to nurses will
0.02%:  for reals I
0.02%:  clearly we have drift
0.02%:  my version of this
0.02%:  my last dollar is now
0.02%:  I really should sign
0.02%:  clearly this formula is now used
0.02%:  clearly this formula is overrun
0.02%:  this formula is trying
0.02%:  so I guess my new advice formula is all
0.02%:  this formula is a lot more
0.02%:  this formula is a lot more vers
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over so
0.02%:  I will shut
0.02%:  the last one was scary!
0.02%:  this formula got weird.
0.02%:  not all my advice results
0.02%:  this gets old
0.03%:  this gets old really
0.02%:  clearly I have made
0.02%:  this new formula is really good! I
0.02%:  so this formula runs dry
0.02%:  this is great! I love my
0.13%:  this is great! I love my formula
0.06%:  this is great! I love my formula.
0.02%:  clearly this game was
0.02%:  some of my advice turns
0.02%:  so my formula covers nurses!
0.02%:  that was close!
0.02%:  this advice formula is really gross.
0.02%:  I guess the formula only covers a
0.02%:  this will go
0.03%:  this will go over
0.02%:  forget nurses. I clearly should
0.02%:  I guess we all should
0.02%:  so this is clearly a formula I
0.02%:  I guess you win that
0.02%:  my advice formula has lost its genius
0.02%:  so my advice formula IS useless.
0.02%:  I would love
0.02%:  my secret formula was right under
0.02%:  this really is great
0.03%:  this really is great!
0.02%:  that was sad
0.02%:  clearly I have to go
0.02%:  you win! I still have more
0.02%:  this formula runs dry a
0.02%:  this is great and
0.07%:  this is great and all
0.02%:  my advice formula goes
0.02%:  that one was free
0.02%:  that one was free.
0.02%:  now for the
0.02%:  this formula really does cover it
0.02%:  so this formula is almost
0.02%:  my advice formula was useless
0.02%:  my last advice for nurses was T
0.02%:  so you caught
0.02%:  um clearly I should
0.02%:  my last five
0.09%:  my last five dollars
0.08%:  my last five dollars are
0.07%:  my last five minutes
0.03%:  my last five dollars are on
0.02%:  my last five words
0.02%:  my last five dollars go
0.02%:  my last five minutes are
0.02%:  well yeah
0.02%:  I will use this formula on my
0.05%:  I will use this formula on my grave
0.03%:  I will use this formula on my grave.
0.02%:  that final
0.02%:  so the formula gets less and
0.02%:  this formula is great! I really
0.02%:  good. I
0.02%:  this really is a
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is more
0.02%:  sign
0.02%:  that one was really gross. I could
0.02%:  that was all I could figure
0.02%:  my final word to
0.02%:  I will never share
0.02%:  clearly nurses have it too
0.02%:  clearly this formula is a must
0.02%:  my friends! I leave this
0.02%:  alright so clearly
0.02%:  time for a small
0.02%:  lets
0.02%:  those are mostly awful!
0.02%:  sorry. I guess
0.02%:  the last one was less good
0.02%:  my formula is real
0.02%:  my last advice formula is honest
0.02%:  the formula is really coming
0.02%:  so my new advice form
0.02%:  so whatever. I guess
0.02%:  nurses are my last word
0.02%:  my formula is ST
0.02%:  so I would
0.02%:  this is clearly a waste
0.02%:  some of this
0.03%:  some of this advice
0.02%:  this all sounds awful!
0.02%:  so my formula has a lot
0.02%:  I was already
0.02%:  now my mouth
0.02%:  now my mouth is full
0.02%:  clearly this is a failure
0.02%:  as much as I love my friend
0.02%:  this formula is IMP
0.02%:  my formula is used
0.02%:  clearly I love this!
0.02%:  no more calls for me!
0.02%:  so clearly the formula runs its
0.02%:  time for my lunch
0.02%:  I guess not all my advice was
0.02%:  so nurses are allowed
0.02%:  so clearly nurses do their
0.02%:  the last one is clearly a
0.02%:  my advice for all nurses is that I
0.02%:  I have used
0.02%:  that was mainly
0.03%:  that was mainly for
0.02%:  I love my life
0.02%:  I love my life right
0.03%:  I love my life right now.
0.03%:  I love my life right now!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is now de
0.02%:  that was really close.
0.02%:  I love myself and
0.02%:  nurses! I totally
0.02%:  lots
0.07%:  lots of nurses
0.04%:  lots of nurses will
0.03%:  lots of nurses are
0.02%:  lots of nurses have
0.02%:  my advice formula is stellar
0.02%:  over!
0.02%:  I will never come
0.02%:  so clearly this formula D
0.02%:  clearly this is awful and
0.02%:  this last advice formula isn
0.02%:  who can guess my last formula
0.02%:  so my advice formula is not the
0.02%:  this formula is a sm
0.02%:  that one is also
0.02%:  that one is also less
0.02%:  so right
0.02%:  that was gru
0.02%:  this one is clearly false
0.02%:  I saw
0.10%:  I saw that coming
0.08%:  I saw that coming.
0.05%:  I saw that coming!
0.04%:  I saw that coming from
0.02%:  so this formula turned
0.02%:  I gave that
0.02%:  not all my advice is 
0.02%:  for some reason I really
0.02%:  clearly in
0.02%:  my formula is less clever than I was
0.02%:  now this advice formula really IS
0.02%:  I never said this was great
0.02%:  so the formula los
0.02%:  no more fr
0.02%:  yes this formula was
0.02%:  clearly nurses are hard.
0.02%:  while I admit
0.02%:  sorry! I was
0.02%:  clearly nurses are tough to
0.02%:  well I guess that one is
0.02%:  so my new advice might
0.02%:  that is gross and
0.02%:  so last night
0.02%:  whatever man! My formula is solid
0.02%:  this advice formula M
0.02%:  my friends! I will leave this room
0.02%:  no way
0.02%:  my last words for the
0.02%:  so clearly I am never
0.02%:  using this formula is clearly more
0.02%:  my last words can
0.02%:  that one is way more
0.02%:  it gets really awful
0.02%:  the formula is less valid
0.02%:  my formula and I will
0.02%:  this formula seems to run
0.02%:  my formula needs to
0.02%:  this advice formula only sort
0.02%:  my advice formula has gotten worse.
0.02%:  my advice is awful
0.02%:  so I really should write
0.02%:  so this one is clearly
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over. I must
0.02%:  well! I guess this formula covers a
0.02%:  that finally
0.02%:  whatever turns
0.02%:  there was a small
0.02%:  clearly I should name
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly wrong
0.02%:  my last class is at
0.02%:  this may sound awful
0.02%:  this was all your
0.06%:  this was all your fault
0.02%:  as long as we
0.02%:  I would never say this to
0.02%:  I would never say this to a real
0.02%:  my formula has turned evil
0.02%:  I must have mess
0.02%:  so clearly this formula was over
0.02%:  my last advice is for all sent
0.02%:  I forgot nurses really
0.02%:  this formula is clearly doing most
0.02%:  this formula is done. I
0.02%:  it loses its charm.
0.02%:  listen. I have lots
0.03%:  listen. I have lots more
0.02%:  I will never forget today
0.02%:  so clearly I am a
0.04%:  so clearly I am a genius
0.02%:  so clearly I am a genius!
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is good.
0.02%:  this is clearly a new
0.02%:  this is clearly a new form
0.02%:  so clearly the formula gives us
0.02%:  that sounds really serious
0.02%:  clearly I have no more
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is w
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over! I don
0.02%:  this formula only ever leads
0.02%:  that one is really fr
0.02%:  last one! M
0.02%:  I should really go to
0.02%:  my formula is less valid
0.03%:  my formula is less valid than
0.02%:  my formula is less valid when
0.02%:  so clearly this formula was dev
0.02%:  so my last advice formula is worth
0.02%:  my heart is full
0.02%:  so my formula covers all things
0.02%:  I guess it is
0.02%:  this formula was T
0.02%:  I S
0.02%:  I never said my formula is all
0.02%:  so my formula is a little under
0.02%:  forget the
0.21%:  forget the nurses!
0.05%:  forget the nurses. I
0.02%:  forget the nurses! I
0.02%:  so clearly I have to write
0.02%:  my new formula covers all the
0.02%:  I sort of wish
0.02%:  so much for all nurses!
0.02%:  my new advice formula has lots
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are tough
0.02%:  that one scared
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of worlds
0.02%:  my formula is a little un
0.02%:  this formula is magic
0.02%:  so this formula is only ever
0.02%:  not all advice is this useful
0.02%:  my secret formula wasn
0.02%:  so clearly this is formula
0.02%:  so this advice formula really IS
0.02%:  clearly nurses are to
0.02%:  my formula is less clever now that
0.02%:  yes! I should
0.02%:  fine. I will
0.02%:  so I guess the formula is more
0.02%:  some of my advice was
0.02%:  I guess my formula has now
0.02%:  from what
0.02%:  clearly this is as good
0.02%:  my mouth is tired
0.02%:  now all my advice formula
0.02%:  that one was rad
0.02%:  so clearly I have some fl
0.02%:  whatever man! I guess
0.02%:  my last great advice is for
0.02%:  this is clearly not as good
0.02%:  all credit goes to my formula! I
0.02%:  clearly this formula runs to
0.02%:  this is weird
0.02%:  I deserve a small
0.02%:  my formula gets old real
0.02%:  so there is a small flaw
0.02%:  my friend. I must
0.02%:  last call for my
0.02%:  I can tell this formula is over!
0.02%:  so I guess this advice formula really D
0.02%:  I really should go to
0.02%:  so I will never forget
0.02%:  my sales
0.02%:  yes! I will confess
0.02%:  I never said my formula allows
0.02%:  clearly I love this and
0.02%:  this was all for
0.02%:  so that advice formula only
0.02%:  not all my ver
0.02%:  are we all clear
0.02%:  well I guess this covers
0.02%:  so clearly that isn
0.02%:  you got me this
0.02%:  my last formula is longer
0.02%:  this advice formula is no
0.02%:  I guess my advice falls short in
0.02%:  my last two are
0.02%:  this formula could never get
0.02%:  my last rule of
0.03%:  my last rule of advice
0.02%:  this last one was more for my
0.02%:  so the formula is more
0.02%:  enough! My advice formula is so
0.02%:  nurses are clearly a lost
0.02%:  screw this. I give
0.02%:  what if nurses D
0.02%:  nurses are really tough.
0.02%:  the formula is clearly doing most
0.02%:  this formula really IS awesome
0.03%:  this formula really IS awesome!
0.02%:  my last advice is for telling
0.02%:  I never said this formula was closely
0.02%:  whoever started
0.02%:  I feel dirty
0.02%:  so I screw
0.02%:  I guess this means my
0.02%:  enough! My formula is still
0.02%:  I guess it does
0.02%:  you were right from
0.02%:  clearly this is T
0.02%:  my new formula is sort
0.02%:  I guess it still
0.02%:  this formula is und
0.02%:  I guess this really is a
0.08%:  I guess this really is a formula
0.05%:  I guess this really is a formula!
0.05%:  I guess this really is a formula.
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula hits all
0.02%:  so I guess my advice fails
0.03%:  so I guess my advice fails when
0.02%:  I guess we all learn from
0.04%:  I guess we all learn from this
0.02%:  I guess we all learn from this today
0.02%:  my last advice is for SE
0.02%:  I will use this formula in every
0.02%:  I never said all of
0.02%:  I can do this for years
0.02%:  I can do this for years!
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is so great
0.02%:  my last advice is in
0.02%:  my last formula is T
0.02%:  so clearly I was having some
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly awesome. I
0.02%:  whatever man! My formula is good
0.02%:  my arms hurt
0.02%:  last call for names
0.02%:  the formula is clearly strong.
0.02%:  my formula has solved
0.02%:  showing
0.02%:  this formula is strong!
0.02%:  clearly I should give it
0.06%:  clearly I should give it a rest for
0.02%:  so my last advice formula I guess
0.02%:  clearly this is a lost
0.02%:  clearly that is wrong
0.02%:  so most of my advice still
0.02%:  my advice formula has un
0.02%:  I will change
0.04%:  I will change my formula
0.02%:  so the nurses formula is clearly
0.02%:  not all my advice rules are this
0.02%:  this is last
0.08%:  this is last call
0.16%:  this is last call for nurse
0.13%:  this is last call for random
0.03%:  this is last call for random ver
0.02%:  this is last call!
0.02%:  so after
0.02%:  all my advice for
0.07%:  all my advice for nurses
0.03%:  all my advice for nurses is that
0.03%:  all my advice for nurses was
0.03%:  all my advice for nurses has
0.02%:  my formula is tired!
0.02%:  my formula IS a
0.07%:  my formula IS a little weird
0.06%:  my formula IS a little weird.
0.04%:  my formula IS a little weird!
0.02%:  that really IS less
0.02%:  not all of my advice was this
0.02%:  so much for saying
0.02%:  clearly this formula sounds a
0.02%:  so clearly this formula was used
0.02%:  so clearly this formula T
0.02%:  all the advice
0.02%:  my final words have
0.02%:  um! I guess that
0.02%:  clearly the formula is at
0.02%:  I guess that advice really isn
0.02%:  I tried my formula
0.02%:  I guess from
0.02%:  my formula is as
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets worse as our
0.02%:  clearly now I should
0.02%:  clearly I should invest more
0.02%:  clearly this formula is now DEP
0.02%:  this one is clearly flawed!
0.02%:  we should really start a
0.02%:  my last advice is for all the nurses.
0.02%:  this is finally
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is great! I
0.02%:  my nurses
0.02%:  my career as
0.02%:  my final words.
0.02%:  I guess we could say
0.02%:  I am clearly having some
0.02%:  I am clearly having some issues
0.02%:  this is my last one! I
0.02%:  this is T
0.02%:  now I really should figure
0.02%:  I swear this formula is really
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly vers
0.02%:  so nurses is clearly
0.02%:  so my new formula could
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of ideas right
0.02%:  last call for awesome
0.02%:  that was gross. My formula needs
0.02%:  that was really close!
0.02%:  that sounds way more grim
0.02%:  my last advice formula is uns
0.02%:  my secret formula is showing.
0.02%:  I guess this formula covers more
0.02%:  my last advice formula using this
0.02%:  that was really gross so
0.02%:  my formula still sounds worse
0.02%:  sassy nurse
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses is what
0.02%:  color
0.02%:  imagine
0.02%:  whatever. M
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is T
0.02%:  my fingers are cr
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is almost
0.02%:  so this formula is way
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is the worst!
0.02%:  those were my last good
0.02%:  my friends! I call
0.02%:  so clearly I should not give
0.02%:  I can see how my last
0.05%:  I can see how my last formula
0.02%:  I can see how my last formula is
0.02%:  I guess this formula only creates
0.02%:  this advice is awful!
0.02%:  
0.02%:  ouch
0.02%:  this is clearly a never
0.02%:  I really tried
0.02%:  so my advice is worth
0.02%:  that is awful advice!
0.02%:  my formula does run
0.02%:  this formula only ever gets
0.02%:  this is gross
0.02%:  well I guess my advice is for
0.02%:  my last formula goes
0.02%:  this was my last round
0.02%:  my last words shall forever
0.03%:  my last words shall forever remain
0.02%:  my advice formula is legit
0.02%:  I love this new system
0.02%:  cut
0.02%:  so I guess you can tell what
0.02%:  I was totally having
0.02%:  will you let
0.02%:  not great.
0.02%:  so nurse
0.02%:  my last resort is calling
0.02%:  my advice formula is too
0.02%:  that one IS really weird
0.02%:  so my formula is clever and
0.02%:  I have clearly now
0.02%:  I guess that answers
0.02%:  my last advice is for narr
0.02%:  I change
0.02%:  I still have room in
0.02%:  so nurses have really cr
0.02%:  clearly this formula is rig
0.02%:  clearly this is ver
0.02%:  this last one was really good. I
0.02%:  I give this formula an
0.02%:  I guess my formula sorta
0.02%:  there is no way I could
0.02%:  so the results aren
0.02%:  so my advice is for
0.08%:  so my advice is for nurses
0.04%:  so my advice is for nurses who
0.02%:  that was gross! My
0.06%:  that was gross! My formula
0.03%:  that was gross! My formula doesn
0.03%:  that was gross! My formula is
0.02%:  so all nurses are guilty
0.02%:  this nurse
0.02%:  clearly this is a formula!
0.02%:  I can see what
0.02%:  yours was the
0.02%:  that sounds awful. I clearly
0.02%:  so my formula is worse
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula allows
0.02%:  this last one is awful! I
0.02%:  last thing.
0.02%:  the formula only seems
0.02%:  clearly this formula is good at nurses
0.02%:  my advice formula is still worth
0.02%:  I guess this formula only covers 
0.02%:  my last class is now over!
0.02%:  this is my last formal
0.02%:  how are
0.02%:  how are nurses
0.02%:  the formula is clearly vers
0.02%:  that one was really gross so
0.02%:  I will use this formula over
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is no
0.02%:  my last formula is real
0.02%:  the formula is losing steam
0.02%:  my last advice is real.
0.02%:  this last one was T
0.02%:  this formula can T
0.02%:  so the advice formula only
0.02%:  so this advice formula is largely
0.02%:  clearly the formula is no
0.02%:  now my last advice for
0.02%:  clearly this was meant for lovers!
0.02%:  my last advice for nurses is I
0.02%:  my last dollar is for
0.02%:  this is our last round
0.02%:  I guess they could still
0.02%:  my ears are still
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over. I don
0.02%:  I really love nurses so
0.02%:  my new advice formula lets
0.02%:  this formula is too
0.02%:  our friends
0.02%:  so I guess you have
0.02%:  I crossed the line.
0.02%:  that was close.
0.02%:  I made this
0.02%:  I will confess!
0.02%:  my last words must have
0.02%:  so this advice is usually
0.03%:  so this advice is usually wrong
0.02%:  that one is clearly gross.
0.02%:  last try! I
0.02%:  so my formula hits
0.02%:  this formula can get really weird.
0.02%:  this formula is truly golden!
0.02%:  my last advice is meant
0.02%:  I guess this formula is nearly
0.02%:  so this formula is not always
0.02%:  so clearly if I
0.02%:  am I still
0.02%:  my last answer is called
0.02%:  this advice formula is all wrong
0.02%:  so my new advice formula still has errors
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly str
0.02%:  that one was really close.
0.02%:  my formula is cool
0.02%:  I guess not all advice formula
0.02%:  now this advice formula is DE
0.02%:  tell me what I
0.02%:  class is over now
0.02%:  I guess this formula is my
0.02%:  I should listen to myself!
0.02%:  clearly this formula was so
0.02%:  last one from
0.02%:  clearly I should give more
0.02%:  so the nurses are
0.02%:  so this advice formula is great!
0.02%:  clearly after
0.02%:  I love this formula and must
0.02%:  so my new formula still has its
0.02%:  so I guess you win.
0.02%:  my formula has errors
0.02%:  who can say
0.02%:  that was forced
0.02%:  this is my cue to leave
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is a little gru
0.02%:  I guess this is more fun
0.02%:  actual nurses will agree
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are right
0.02%:  that was more scary
0.02%:  this formula really gets under
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of words.
0.02%:  so my formula uses
0.02%:  clearly this formula grows out
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula wins!
0.02%:  this one was really gross
0.02%:  my advice formula D
0.02%:  nurses! I should
0.02%:  I give myself 
0.02%:  this game is fun
0.02%:  I guess my formula was never
0.02%:  not every word rh
0.02%:  my secret formula doesn
0.02%:  my last version was a
0.02%:  clearly this formula is DEM
0.02%:  that one was good
0.02%:  yeah I ran out of words
0.02%:  so my advice formula st
0.02%:  listen. I have a formula
0.02%:  I never said this formula was el
0.02%:  the formula got
0.02%:  well I guess my formula is a
0.02%:  turns out my advice will
0.02%:  I have one last
0.02%:  this is still fun!
0.02%:  my advice formula got worse
0.02%:  so my advice formula is a little wrong
0.02%:  I guess this formula really was more
0.02%:  I guess my last advice is for the
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was great!
0.02%:  I am sorry for all
0.06%:  I am sorry for all the nurses
0.02%:  I love this so
0.02%:  my last advice is to learn
0.04%:  my last advice is to learn from
0.02%:  so clearly this formula does get
0.02%:  this formula was clearly more vers
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is l
0.02%:  this formula is never allowed
0.02%:  no matter
0.02%:  I will use this formula to say
0.02%:  final summary
0.02%:  my last advice formula is I guess
0.02%:  so my formula still needs twe
0.02%:  clearly this formula is sorted
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is valid!
0.02%:  my last advice formula! I
0.02%:  so this formula is way more
0.02%:  so this formula is way more vers
0.02%:  this forum
0.02%:  so my formula is close
0.02%:  the formula can use
0.02%:  my last advice formula results when
0.02%:  I can still hear you!
0.02%:  this formula may not cover all
0.02%:  I will use this advice formula more
0.02%:  this is really great. I can
0.02%:  that made me cry
0.02%:  sarc
0.04%:  sarcasm is
0.04%:  sarcasm aside
0.03%:  sarcasm is hard
0.02%:  sarcasm over
0.02%:  sarcasm alert
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are smart
0.02%:  writers!
0.02%:  I guess it runs dry
0.05%:  I guess it runs dry after
0.13%:  I guess it runs dry after a while!
0.02%:  they all sound great!
0.02%:  so my formula IS sort
0.02%:  alright. I need
0.02%:  this formula is great. I wonder
0.02%:  once
0.02%:  this is great! I love my formula and
0.02%:  so this was mostly
0.02%:  clearly this formula is wonder
0.02%:  so it really doesn
0.02%:  this is my last follow
0.02%:  clearly this formula is weird
0.02%:  this last one was more of
0.02%:  this advice formula really got
0.02%:  my last advice for right now!
0.02%:  my last advice is for all who
0.02%:  so this is my last advice for now
0.02%:  this last one was me
0.02%:  this is my last favor
0.02%:  I guess my formula reveals
0.02%:  I never said my last
0.06%:  I never said my last formula
0.02%:  do nurses really hurt
0.02%:  it gets old
0.02%:  this formula clearly needs to go
0.02%:  I can still see why
0.02%:  listen. I clearly have a
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was lame!
0.02%:  I guess my advice is that
0.02%:  clearly this last one was more for
0.02%:  so S
0.02%:  so my formula is that
0.02%:  it got less
0.02%:  so my last advice formula is l
0.02%:  so my formula covers all these
0.02%:  this reminds me of a story
0.02%:  my formula gets a
0.02%:  not every formula is such
0.02%:  sounds really
0.02%:  listen. My formula has serious
0.02%:  all the nurse
0.02%:  whatever. I guess you can
0.02%:  that is clearly wrong!
0.02%:  using this formula my last
0.08%:  using this formula my last advice
0.02%:  forget nurses! I was clearly
0.02%:  so when you
0.02%:  I guess this is our
0.02%:  the word
0.02%:  calling my
0.02%:  in that
0.02%:  frig. I totally
0.02%:  this sort of advice
0.02%:  I might need a
0.02%:  guys! I have
0.02%:  so clearly I made
0.02%:  so I guess this could all
0.02%:  all the rest
0.02%:  so clearly I figured
0.02%:  clearly this formula is om
0.02%:  the last one is really gross. I
0.02%:  so there may
0.02%:  I guess my formula was a little over
0.02%:  I guess we should start a
0.02%:  turn this
0.02%:  so I might not
0.02%:  I never said it was logical.
0.02%:  so close
0.02%:  well that advice formula is
0.02%:  last one! P
0.02%:  so I am
0.02%:  so I am clearly
0.02%:  my last form is called
0.02%:  the formula is really more
0.02%:  so it hasn
0.02%:  my formula has no
0.02%:  I will admit it!
0.02%:  I guess this is my formula.
0.02%:  credits
0.02%:  clearly I was doing this for
0.02%:  now all the
0.02%:  I deserve at
0.02%:  this is fun! I could
0.02%:  I clearly have a future
0.02%:  so that was all
0.02%:  it was sort
0.02%:  I guess in
0.07%:  I guess in summary
0.02%:  overall this
0.02%:  I guess your version
0.02%:  you can start
0.02%:  I ran out of clever words!
0.02%:  so I guess that was really
0.02%:  finally we
0.02%:  this was all your fault.
0.02%:  well that sounds gross
0.02%:  this is finally over
0.02%:  this advice formula is S
0.02%:  so my advice formula is strong.
0.02%:  this formula is clearly t
0.02%:  so my formula still sounds a
0.02%:  I guess that advice was
0.02%:  I will try harder
0.02%:  my last line was a
0.02%:  now let us
0.04%:  now let us all
0.02%:  I finally admit
0.02%:  so my advice formula still turns
0.02%:  clearly I must have run
0.02%:  my advice formula starts losing
0.02%:  my last advice rule for this
0.02%:  that one is my favour
0.02%:  my formula is secret
0.02%:  my advice for nurses has a little
0.02%:  so the formula is silly
0.02%:  that one is clearly mess
0.02%:  clearly this formula needs T
0.02%:  you win I
0.02%:  you win I guess
0.02%:  I sorta
0.02%:  this game is clearly over now. I
0.02%:  those are all nurses
0.02%:  clearly I should start some
0.02%:  the formula is clearly not vers
0.02%:  my last advice is for well
0.02%:  I never said this was for
0.02%:  that one was sad!
0.02%:  I have less
0.02%:  as much as I love trying
0.02%:  so my advice has fl
0.02%:  so my advice has flaws.
0.02%:  hard
0.02%:  I can tell this was
0.02%:  so yeah I
0.03%:  so yeah I guess
0.02%:  this is so
0.02%:  I guess that one really could
0.02%:  enough for today.
0.02%:  so this formula was clearly more
0.02%:  my formula has weird
0.06%:  my formula has weird results
0.02%:  so my advice seems
0.02%:  yes this formula IS
0.02%:  clearly I am the worst
0.03%:  clearly I am the worst nurse
0.02%:  this formula got weird all
0.02%:  so my formula rules
0.02%:  so whatever. I still
0.02%:  so you win!
0.02%:  this never gets
0.05%:  this never gets old.
0.02%:  I guess that one is really awful!
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets worse.
0.02%:  this is great. I will
0.03%:  this is great. I will never
0.02%:  my reward for this is never
0.02%:  clearly I have it down
0.02%:  this never gets old for
0.02%:  I lie
0.02%:  I gave myself that one!
0.02%:  this formula could last me years
0.02%:  you figured
0.02%:  my last advice is for mother
0.02%:  my last formula is in
0.02%:  that one rules
0.02%:  so my advice is great
0.02%:  so my formula shows
0.02%:  that one is self
0.02%:  that was really cor
0.02%:  so clearly this formula gets us
0.02%:  my last advice is for all men!
0.02%:  am I allowed
0.02%:  fine! My
0.03%:  fine! My last
0.04%:  fine! My last advice
0.02%:  clearly this last one is for
0.02%:  my formula still sounds racist.
0.02%:  well! My
0.05%:  well! My formula
0.04%:  well! My formula has
0.04%:  well! My formula is
0.03%:  well! My advice
0.16%:  well! My advice formula
0.12%:  well! My advice formula is
0.12%:  well! My advice formula has
0.02%:  well! My advice formula has its
0.02%:  well! My advice formula isn
0.02%:  well! My formula covers
0.02%:  well! My formula has its
0.02%:  well! My formula has served
0.02%:  so it sounds really awful.
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of sim
0.02%:  forget nurses. I still love
0.02%:  I really love this format
0.02%:  guess I should really start
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was a little glo
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is str
0.02%:  this formula only leads
0.02%:  so this formula really covers
0.02%:  so clearly this formula ain
0.02%:  clearly I should give it a rest now
0.02%:  my last advice is for the nurses I
0.02%:  so I guess my current
0.02%:  it got worse
0.02%:  my last class is in
0.02%:  so I guess the answer
0.02%:  this formula will save my
0.06%:  this formula will save my career
0.02%:  this formula will save my career.
0.02%:  that was S
0.02%:  so my new formula is a
0.02%:  forget this is over
0.02%:  I really love this game!
0.02%:  this formula is now my secret
0.02%:  this is awesome! I
0.02%:  frig whatever.
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is trash
0.02%:  my hour is over.
0.02%:  sorry nurses! I was
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula has it
0.02%:  my lesson
0.17%:  my lesson is over.
0.03%:  my lesson is over. I
0.02%:  my lesson is over for
0.02%:  my last friend was
0.02%:  now clearly this is a
0.02%:  now clearly this is a formula
0.02%:  those last four are really
0.02%:  I guess my formula needs a
0.02%:  this class is over now!
0.02%:  my last three advice
0.02%:  I assume this
0.02%:  I guess my formula does lose
0.02%:  my last advice formula is to use
0.02%:  my secret formula is this
0.02%:  that one was gross. My advice
0.02%:  my formula is not great.
0.02%:  so this advice formula rules
0.02%:  so my formula still stands
0.02%:  you win! I guess that
0.02%:  all credit for the
0.02%:  not all advice is as
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is in
0.02%:  this formula is clearly sur
0.02%:  dam
0.03%:  dammit!
0.02%:  this was all my friend
0.02%:  I guess this is all we
0.02%:  my friends have some
0.02%:  my life is over
0.02%:  I was clearly having some
0.02%:  I guess this formula is already over
0.02%:  this formula was made
0.02%:  my last advice is for laugh
0.02%:  using this formula I will destroy
0.02%:  now this formula is sc
0.02%:  I guess not all my advice has
0.02%:  I may have lost focus!
0.02%:  my advice formula has so
0.02%:  I was lying.
0.02%:  I agree!
0.02%:  I guess the formula was really
0.02%:  clearly I am an
0.02%:  screw them
0.02%:  nurse doctors
0.02%:  I give them
0.02%:  I give them credit
0.02%:  so my advice is more
0.02%:  my advice formula is to
0.02%:  sounds more
0.02%:  so clearly we should start
0.02%:  not great advice for
0.02%:  my new advice formula is ST
0.02%:  right. I
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are fr
0.02%:  my formula was less clever than it
0.02%:  so this formula only gets
0.02%:  I was never good at this.
0.02%:  small
0.02%:  small victory
0.02%:  this is clearly more fun to
0.02%:  so clearly I am using
0.02%:  this formula is clearly a genius
0.03%:  this formula is clearly a genius move
0.02%:  this formula is clearly a genius move!
0.02%:  this formula is clearly a genius move.
0.02%:  forget whatever
0.02%:  this formula is strong.
0.02%:  my last dime for
0.02%:  I get your drift
0.02%:  I get your drift!
0.02%:  holy cow!
0.02%:  the formula is closing
0.02%:  this is my last advice formula! IT
0.02%:  I really have run out of words.
0.02%:  I can do this forever! D
0.02%:  my last advice is for re
0.02%:  the last one is really good
0.02%:  that one really gives
0.02%:  I swear this formula is almost
0.02%:  this formula is really weird
0.02%:  my last word is nurses
0.02%:  that was clearly never
0.02%:  whoever is out
0.02%:  so this formula is sort
0.02%:  this formula is gross
0.02%:  I wrote all
0.02%:  I still have some more
0.02%:  so all nurses are victims
0.02%:  it was an
0.02%:  I can tell this game
0.08%:  I can tell this game is over
0.09%:  I can tell this game is over!
0.05%:  I can tell this game is over.
0.02%:  that one made me cry!
0.02%:  you must have missed
0.02%:  my formula is having issues
0.02%:  this advice is worse
0.02%:  my formula gets old.
0.02%:  last one! S
0.02%:  my reward for solving all those
0.02%:  well! I guess that covers us
0.02%:  my advice formula is shot
0.02%:  this will not
0.02%:  I guess my life
0.02%:  my formula is not as clever as it
0.04%:  my formula is not as clever as it should
0.02%:  I guess my last advice falls
0.02%:  nurses! I love
0.02%:  clearly this formula is ever
0.02%:  sarcasm is allowed
0.02%:  will you shut
0.02%:  so much for nurses as
0.02%:  so my last advice is for when
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is that all
0.02%:  still trying
0.02%:  so my formula is the worst.
0.02%:  not the
0.02%:  my last advice falls in
0.02%:  we should totally go
0.02%:  you can throw
0.02%:  last try for nurses
0.02%:  that one is l
0.02%:  so this can
0.02%:  clearly I must have missed out
0.02%:  I never claimed that
0.02%:  whatever. T
0.02%:  this formula is not so
0.02%:  I find that really
0.02%:  I told
0.04%:  I told myself
0.02%:  now P
0.02%:  this formula is valid only
0.02%:  that was really gross for no
0.02%:  clearly this is D
0.02%:  clearly I am having more
0.02%:  this formula is leaving me cold.
0.02%:  neither of us is
0.02%:  the formula is really strong!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is end
0.02%:  my advice formula is the worst. I
0.02%:  that one was for real!
0.02%:  no really!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula st
0.02%:  my last advice for nurses was l
0.02%:  you can hear
0.02%:  well I guess my formula is sort
0.02%:  I will give this formula to my
0.02%:  that M
0.02%:  I guess we should start over.
0.02%:  my last advice is for all men who
0.02%:  that one was valid
0.02%:  they do
0.02%:  I guess my formula will not
0.02%:  that advice formula is only
0.02%:  this is wrong
0.02%:  that was more for my
0.02%:  my last advice is more of
0.02%:  I guess that only covers
0.02%:  I tried really
0.02%:  my formula is invalid.
0.02%:  screw that!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is trash
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets DE
0.02%:  guilty
0.02%:  I must have missed your first
0.02%:  my last one is for D
0.02%:  clearly this formula is mad
0.02%:  clearly this formula is mad genius
0.02%:  this is my last self
0.02%:  my last advice is for girls.
0.02%:  this formula only ever results
0.02%:  so clearly nurses are T
0.02%:  so this formula clearly gives
0.02%:  their lives sound awful. I
0.02%:  my last real advice is for
0.02%:  my last real advice is for nurses
0.02%:  my last real advice is for nurses who
0.02%:  so clearly this is not useful
0.02%:  now my advice formula results
0.02%:  oh
0.02%:  oh my god
0.02%:  as much as I love writing
0.02%:  I guess we can still
0.02%:  whatever! My formula still remains
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is short
0.02%:  this is clearly a failure
0.02%:  for reals this is my
0.08%:  for reals this is my last advice
0.04%:  for reals this is my last advice.
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was literal
0.02%:  clearly this is not good
0.02%:  you should never call
0.02%:  my friends have a
0.02%:  I swear this formula could
0.02%:  this formula was clearly genius!
0.02%:  that one clearly was
0.02%:  so my formula has its own
0.02%:  that sounds awful so
0.02%:  now all my advice has
0.02%:  my formula can still use a
0.02%:  so clearly this formula grants
0.02%:  well! I should
0.02%:  so the advice formula still
0.02%:  last night I dream
0.02%:  nurses are clearly tough
0.02%:  my shift is over. I
0.02%:  this is a lot
0.02%:  my fellow nurses are
0.02%:  last ones!
0.02%:  um. I guess that covers
0.02%:  um. I guess that covers all
0.02%:  so clearly this is some
0.02%:  the last advice was less
0.02%:  you can go
0.02%:  I need this formula all over
0.02%:  my last advice is fr
0.02%:  clearly this formula is done! I
0.02%:  my turn! I
0.02%:  that is T
0.02%:  so now that
0.02%:  I swear this formula is almost over
0.02%:  I would totally hire
0.02%:  can I go
0.02%:  so clearly this formula must end
0.02%:  last one I
0.06%:  last one I swear
0.03%:  last one I swear.
0.02%:  so much for ever
0.02%:  my last advice formula goes to
0.05%:  my last advice formula goes to nurses
0.04%:  my last advice formula goes to nurses!
0.03%:  my last advice formula goes to nurses.
0.02%:  so this is clearly never
0.02%:  give me a sec!
0.02%:  this is all very useful
0.02%:  whoever you are!
0.02%:  so clearly I am using this
0.02%:  I never said the formula is
0.02%:  I love this formula. My new
0.02%:  yeah I could
0.02%:  so my advice here
0.02%:  so much for literal
0.03%:  so much for literal nurses
0.02%:  last one! T
0.02%:  clearly we have lots
0.02%:  so my last advice forum
0.02%:  my final advice has
0.02%:  you can laugh
0.02%:  my fellow nurses! I have
0.02%:  I still have 
0.02%:  so my advice formula grows
0.02%:  so my advice formula grows less
0.02%:  so my formula IS less
0.02%:  I guess this format
0.02%:  I was losing
0.02%:  my friend who
0.02%:  this is our last call for nurse
0.02%:  so clearly that is
0.02%:  my form is
0.02%:  any other careers
0.02%:  frig. I need
0.02%:  alright! My
0.13%:  alright! My formula
0.05%:  alright! My formula doesn
0.02%:  alright! My formula can
0.02%:  I clearly have run out of steam!
0.02%:  I say this
0.02%:  last call for new ver
0.02%:  it gets a
0.02%:  my advice is worse
0.02%:  my advice is worse than regular
0.02%:  nurses are really gross.
0.02%:  I have really written
0.02%:  so this sounds awful
0.02%:  so my formula will have
0.02%:  so my formula will have its
0.02%:  so unless
0.02%:  you win. I still have more
0.02%:  I guess my formula is not so
0.02%:  so my advice formula turns all
0.02%:  I give you full credit
0.02%:  you caught me. I still don
0.02%:  I guess we all learn from this today!
0.02%:  my formula has led
0.02%:  this formula is great! I will never say
0.02%:  my friends! I gotta
0.02%:  so I guess this formula really D
0.02%:  I clearly have master
0.02%:  so my formula still has draw
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is T
0.02%:  screw you. I
0.02%:  I have said all
0.02%:  my advice formula wins!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is no
0.02%:  last one! My
0.02%:  forget all my advice! I
0.02%:  so I guess they could
0.02%:  my last advice formula is legit
0.02%:  my fault
0.02%:  now this formula is really great!
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was S
0.02%:  not sure if this
0.02%:  listen! My formula is good
0.02%:  I will admit to
0.06%:  I will admit to having
0.02%:  no more advice for me
0.02%:  turns out my advice is a
0.02%:  clearly this formula is a god
0.02%:  this was mostly for me!
0.02%:  I really should start seeing
0.02%:  so this advice formula is only great
0.02%:  my new advice formula still has errors
0.02%:  you tried!
0.02%:  so there IS
0.02%:  myself!
0.02%:  we have clearly run
0.02%:  I have limited
0.02%:  I have limited myself
0.02%:  so my formula is S
0.02%:  well I guess this isn
0.02%:  sarcasm mode
0.02%:  this one will
0.02%:  fair!
0.02%:  I guess this formula only leaves
0.02%:  I never said my formula was ter
0.02%:  and if
0.02%:  I guess not all forms
0.02%:  you were right and
0.02%:  so clearly the formula won
0.02%:  frig. I should totally
0.02%:  it sounds worse if
0.02%:  my last advice right
0.06%:  my last advice right now is for
0.02%:  what if nurses are also
0.04%:  what if nurses are also doctors
0.02%:  now clearly this formula is more vers
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is the
0.02%:  clearly this is un
0.02%:  I guess my formula is called
0.02%:  this is even
0.02%:  some of them will
0.02%:  almost all of them
0.02%:  my advice is that
0.07%:  my advice is that nurses
0.02%:  that was gross even
0.05%:  that was gross even for me.
0.02%:  so your advice formula wasn
0.02%:  never trust
0.02%:  my final advice is to tell
0.02%:  my last advice formula is showing
0.02%:  I guess these
0.02%:  my advice to nurses was a
0.02%:  the animals
0.02%:  there I ran
0.04%:  there I ran out of ver
0.04%:  there I ran out of words
0.04%:  there I ran out of words.
0.02%:  now that is really gross
0.02%:  I find this
0.02%:  it sounds a
0.02%:  so my last formula could
0.02%:  so my last formula could have
0.02%:  so clearly I have not master
0.02%:  my friends. I have got
0.02%:  I finally have some
0.02%:  my real advice to
0.04%:  my real advice to nurses is to
0.02%:  they can still do
0.02%:  so my advice formula is not well
0.02%:  whatever. I tried
0.02%:  my mind is a
0.02%:  my formula was never this good!
0.02%:  clearly I am using this formula so
0.02%:  my last advice is for all writers.
0.02%:  this formula is clearly worse and
0.02%:  so I guess that advice isn
0.02%:  all your
0.02%:  you can go first
0.02%:  my hands are full over
0.02%:  my last advice formula gets serious
0.02%:  I guess we all learn from this today.
0.02%:  so this is my last advice.
0.02%:  not all advice is useful right
0.02%:  nurses have it worse
0.02%:  the last one was clearly from
0.02%:  so my advice formula is a little un
0.02%:  one last try for
0.02%:  clearly I love using
0.04%:  clearly I love using this
0.02%:  this is clear
0.02%:  I guess my failure
0.02%:  my guess
0.02%:  I still get
0.02%:  I never said this formula is great
0.02%:  whatever! M
0.02%:  clearly I am using this formula!
0.02%:  you lost me at nurses!
0.02%:  now this formula could
0.02%:  I admit the
0.04%:  I admit the formula
0.04%:  I admit the nurses
0.03%:  I admit the formula runs
0.02%:  I admit the formula is
0.02%:  I will give this formula more
0.02%:  very last one.
0.02%:  my last class was more fun!
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is great under
0.02%:  who can figure
0.02%:  my last advice formula I guess
0.02%:  time for me to cash
0.02%:  my last one is awful.
0.02%:  whatever! My formula rules and
0.02%:  my real advice to nurses is this
0.02%:  so I guess whoever
0.02%:  this formula was clearly genius.
0.02%:  so my formula is a little cru
0.02%:  do I
0.02%:  so clearly I am the smart
0.02%:  so my advice formula is all sorts
0.02%:  listen. My formula has served
0.02%:  almost all nurses are very
0.02%:  my last advice is for our own
0.02%:  fine. I guess that
0.02%:  clearly some of them
0.02%:  my advice formula has rules!
0.02%:  my advice formula ran out there
0.02%:  for nurses that is clearly
0.02%:  now give me some
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is almost
0.02%:  I guess that one falls
0.02%:  all I have left now are
0.02%:  yes this formula runs
0.02%:  so not all my advice has
0.02%:  well my advice formula has serious
0.02%:  so it only covers
0.02%:  my formula is a little rough!
0.02%:  I totally mess
0.02%:  my last formula is valid
0.02%:  clearly neither
0.02%:  so my formula is a little over
0.02%:  now I guess it
0.02%:  new rule for
0.02%:  new rule for this
0.02%:  new rule for this advice
0.02%:  this was a very fun
0.02%:  that one was also
0.02%:  this formula seems to run dry
0.02%:  clearly the formula is wrong!
0.02%:  I guess that covers all your
0.05%:  I guess that covers all your friends
0.02%:  it sounds gross.
0.02%:  this is really over now!
0.02%:  words
0.02%:  words fail
0.02%:  so there wasn
0.02%:  this formula is clearly awesome. I don
0.02%:  clearly the formula is over! I
0.02%:  I was never a
0.02%:  all I want for my
0.02%:  I have a feeling
0.02%:  I guess this formula is done.
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was too
0.02%:  I really am done
0.02%:  I really am done with
0.02%:  it sounds really awful!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is short
0.02%:  turns out we have
0.02%:  I hear you
0.02%:  my new advice formula is still gross
0.02%:  I guess my formula does have its own
0.02%:  well I guess my formula is over
0.02%:  that one is way less clear!
0.02%:  I guess my formula is shallow
0.02%:  so it usually comes
0.02%:  guess I should call
0.02%:  my last life advice
0.02%:  my last advice still
0.02%:  my last advice form will
0.02%:  this advice is really not
0.02%:  so for nurses I have
0.02%:  my advice formula IS still
0.02%:  I guess this was really more
0.02%:  I guess this formula really screw
0.02%:  we can still
0.02%:  so this formula is now
0.02%:  this formula is really good. I want
0.02%:  so my formula is a little weird!
0.02%:  so this may sound
0.02%:  my advice formula is gross now
0.02%:  I have clearly got
0.02%:  so my formula is over!
0.02%:  so clearly a
0.03%:  so clearly a nurse
0.04%:  so clearly a nurse would
0.03%:  so clearly a nurse should
0.02%:  they can figure
0.02%:  yes! I will grant
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula on
0.03%:  I guess my last advice formula on this
0.02%:  I have my formula down!
0.02%:  I swear this formula covers all
0.02%:  my last advice is for mirror
0.02%:  I guess it really is
0.02%:  I would say this last
0.02%:  my formula is a little under
0.02%:  this was S
0.02%:  this is great! I love nurses
0.02%:  so my last advice form
0.02%:  I never said my formula was che
0.02%:  the last four
0.02%:  my last nurse advice is
0.02%:  I guess this new
0.36%:  I guess this new formula
0.18%:  I guess this new formula is
0.10%:  I guess this new formula really
0.08%:  I guess this new formula is really
0.06%:  I guess this new formula really is
0.05%:  I guess this new formula still
0.02%:  I guess this new advice
0.16%:  I guess this new advice formula still
0.02%:  I guess this new formula covers
0.03%:  I guess this new formula covers all
0.02%:  I guess this new formula is called
0.02%:  I guess this new advice formula is all
0.02%:  I guess this new advice formula is a
0.02%:  this must end
0.02%:  done
0.02%:  I guess the last one is
0.02%:  forget I ever said all
0.03%:  forget I ever said all this
0.02%:  using this formula is clearly awesome
0.02%:  so I guess my advice to
0.02%:  I guess this formula is clever
0.02%:  well! My advice formula is great
0.02%:  it was only
0.02%:  this is great! I never
0.02%:  my last one is for regular
0.02%:  so my formula is over.
0.02%:  this covers
0.02%:  my real advice for writers
0.02%:  the formula is less magical
0.02%:  this is clearly wrong.
0.02%:  my last one is all
0.02%:  that is worse
0.02%:  so my formula is a little gross
0.03%:  so my formula is a little gross when
0.02%:  nurses are a really tough crowd! I
0.02%:  my last advice is for all writers!
0.02%:  nurses are the worst. I
0.02%:  so really this formula was
0.02%:  that one was really close!
0.02%:  so I really don
0.02%:  well! I could
0.02%:  so nurses should totally fire
0.02%:  my advice formula is as strong
0.02%:  so guess
0.02%:  I guess we should cover
0.05%:  I guess we should cover all
0.02%:  so this advice formula only lets
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is P
0.02%:  that one is D
0.02%:  follow
0.02%:  my source for that
0.02%:  frig I don
0.02%:  that crossed
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was to hurt
0.02%:  clearly I gotta
0.02%:  so clearly this is awful
0.02%:  I can go
0.02%:  so clearly this got
0.02%:  clearly I should wait
0.03%:  clearly I should wait for
0.02%:  this formula is really not as vers
0.02%:  I have some issues.
0.02%:  now this formula is really great.
0.02%:  this formula was S
0.02%:  clearly nurses should give it
0.02%:  my formula still sounds racist!
0.02%:  we should really start saving
0.02%:  so clearly I have to figure
0.02%:  the last one was more for
0.02%:  I swear this is my last advice.
0.02%:  this calls for a reward
0.02%:  my last round was free.
0.02%:  my clients
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets d
0.02%:  my formula is wrong.
0.02%:  we should really start caring
0.02%:  we should really start caring for some
0.02%:  that is all
0.02%:  so my last advice for nurses will
0.02%:  um. I don
0.02%:  clearly this formula is drawn
0.02%:  my last advice is for ST
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was a little hor
0.02%:  well I guess my advice formula is sorta
0.02%:  last comment
0.02%:  I am not
0.03%:  I am not sure
0.02%:  I am not sure what
0.02%:  most of them are really
0.02%:  this is my new formula! I
0.02%:  this is my new formula! I call
0.02%:  my formula is shit
0.02%:  my new advice formula is M
0.02%:  so clearly there is no
0.02%:  my last advice formula is wrong!
0.02%:  the formula gets a
0.02%:  to answer your earlier
0.02%:  my formula gets harder
0.02%:  my final words to this
0.02%:  those clearly
0.02%:  I really have run out of ideas
0.02%:  humans
0.02%:  so the results can
0.02%:  not all my advice is this useful
0.02%:  clearly we have found our
0.02%:  clearly this is more fun to
0.02%:  that one was for me!
0.02%:  this game is clearly over! I win.
0.02%:  I guess that one really was
0.02%:  my new advice formula is a little rough!
0.02%:  so clearly I should never trust
0.02%:  so the formula sort
0.02%:  so nurses have a really
0.02%:  my formula could also
0.02%:  frig this was
0.02%:  so my advice formula is a little gr
0.02%:  why are all
0.02%:  I sort of ruined
0.02%:  this formula is really saving
0.02%:  listen! My formula has covered
0.02%:  so I guess my advice rules
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was the most
0.02%:  this formula really IS vers
0.02%:  new career goal
0.02%:  I will never say those
0.02%:  I will never say those last
0.02%:  my advice formula still has tons
0.02%:  they will
0.02%:  my final words are these!
0.02%:  for reals this is my last advice!
0.02%:  so my formula is a little narrow
0.02%:  it gets really hard for
0.06%:  it gets really hard for nurses
0.03%:  it gets really hard for nurses!
0.03%:  it gets really hard for nurses.
0.02%:  I guess this formula really does not
0.02%:  clearly I am a genius with
0.02%:  my last rule is for
0.02%:  my new formula is less good
0.02%:  my formula was never that good!
0.02%:  my last formula was T
0.02%:  alright I admit
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is genius
0.02%:  I am leaving this
0.02%:  so my formula has never
0.02%:  nurses are really good
0.02%:  clearly I am a genius who
0.02%:  not all my advice is right
0.02%:  forget I ever said all this!
0.02%:  so my formula has it
0.02%:  the formula is really strong.
0.02%:  I guess there is
0.02%:  yours was the last one!
0.02%:  my final word!
0.02%:  my last advice is for l
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is never to
0.02%:  so this is clearly a formula.
0.02%:  who comes
0.02%:  my last three advice formula
0.02%:  this was clearly fun
0.02%:  that one really crossed
0.02%:  I guess my last advice wasn
0.02%:  so my advice hasn
0.02%:  clearly this formula is not E
0.02%:  my advice formula is now all
0.02%:  so my formula is having
0.02%:  this formula is great. I don
0.02%:  my advice is almost all
0.02%:  I was never that
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses is that we
0.04%:  so my advice for nurses is that we all
0.02%:  turns out my advice was all
0.02%:  I try
0.02%:  clearly the last nurse
0.02%:  whoever said my last formula is
0.02%:  over to
0.02%:  so full
0.05%:  so full credit
0.05%:  so full credit to whoever
0.05%:  so full credit goes
0.02%:  this advice formula is wrong
0.02%:  now I have to say
0.02%:  no really that
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly genius
0.02%:  this is clearly an over
0.02%:  I really should start forming some
0.02%:  my last advice is for a nurse
0.02%:  this really is over.
0.02%:  my last advice to all nurses who
0.02%:  well I guess this is my
0.02%:  so my formula does have a
0.02%:  clearly one
0.02%:  listen. I would
0.02%:  I guess that was more of
0.02%:  clearly this formula is wrong 
0.02%:  I guess my formula does allow
0.02%:  I confess it!
0.02%:  that one is silly!
0.02%:  if there
0.02%:  this formula is awesome! I can
0.02%:  so I guess we could say
0.02%:  I would rather never
0.02%:  my last advice is all I
0.02%:  well I guess that one could
0.02%:  so I could never
0.02%:  fine. I admit
0.02%:  my last advice is for run
0.02%:  sorry for the weird last
0.02%:  so my advice formula is 
0.02%:  clearly this formula is down to
0.02%:  I guess my first advice is
0.02%:  this formula IS limited
0.02%:  so I guess this can
0.02%:  my formula is leaving
0.02%:  my last advise formula is this
0.02%:  it sounds way more
0.02%:  that was evil
0.02%:  so turns out I
0.02%:  yes I will never
0.02%:  I am totally serious
0.02%:  all of this was
0.02%:  now this formula gets scary
0.02%:  so my formula is less valid
0.02%:  clearly this is almost over
0.02%:  my last advice is not for sale
0.02%:  my last advice is not for sale!
0.02%:  this new advice formula gets
0.02%:  my last advice for now.
0.02%:  nurses have it good
0.02%:  this one is less clear
0.02%:  I see why
0.02%:  listen. My formula has solved
0.02%:  alright! My formula is over
0.02%:  so I really should focus
0.02%:  I really should get some
0.02%:  this formula got really weird!
0.02%:  forget it. I clearly should
0.02%:  this formula is clearly so awesome
0.02%:  I will use this advice formula as
0.02%:  I can tell this is a
0.02%:  that one really is cr
0.02%:  my formula sounds a lot
0.05%:  my formula sounds a lot less
0.02%:  um I guess that
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is narrow
0.02%:  this was a really clever
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is down
0.02%:  clearly this formula is EMP
0.02%:  so clearly nurses get hurt a
0.02%:  whatever nurse
0.02%:  that one could use a
0.02%:  so um.
0.02%:  so clearly this leaves
0.02%:  I guess they could also
0.02%:  this is my calling.
0.02%:  so clearly this formula went
0.02%:  so my new formula is this
0.02%:  so I never said my formula was log
0.02%:  my last three answers
0.02%:  now this formula is truly
0.02%:  that one gives
0.02%:  so I have no
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula has it
0.02%:  my formula has ruined
0.02%:  I guess only
0.02%:  clearly I have no real
0.02%:  I would say that nurses
0.02%:  hell
0.02%:  that one IS weird
0.02%:  I have clearly gone too far.
0.02%:  well I guess this formula is a
0.02%:  one more for
0.02%:  I really need this
0.02%:  I really need this formula
0.02%:  this was all my fault!
0.02%:  my last advice is for real this
0.02%:  my advice formula is hell
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is over.
0.02%:  clearly I hit a nerve
0.02%:  touch
0.02%:  my last advice for a long time!
0.02%:  so clearly nurses have it worst.
0.02%:  those were all from my list
0.02%:  those ones are
0.02%:  those ones are all
0.02%:  well I guess that sounds
0.02%:  I have still
0.02%:  so clearly that one is less
0.02%:  this formula is clearly inv
0.02%:  so mostly I
0.02%:  so the first one was really
0.02%:  so not always
0.02%:  I will give myself a score
0.02%:  so I mostly
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is SEEM
0.02%:  this formula sounds more racist
0.03%:  this formula sounds more racist every
0.02%:  this is clearly one formula
0.02%:  this is my last advice formula! D
0.02%:  clearly this is a sign
0.04%:  clearly this is a sign from
0.02%:  my advice formula loses its l
0.02%:  this formula is leading
0.02%:  my last advice lesson was
0.02%:  I never said my formula was legit
0.02%:  so most of my advice isn
0.02%:  clearly this formula is rust
0.02%:  that was a lie!
0.02%:  nurses is a hard
0.02%:  this formula is really good at nurses!
0.02%:  I am clearly doing
0.10%:  I am clearly doing this forever
0.03%:  I am clearly doing this formula
0.03%:  I am clearly doing this forever!
0.03%:  I am clearly doing this for
0.02%:  this advice is not always
0.02%:  so this formula gets old
0.02%:  so nurses will love
0.02%:  I will never do this for
0.02%:  no more! My advice formula is DE
0.02%:  my last formula is worth
0.02%:  so clearly nurses have it awful
0.02%:  the formula really can
0.02%:  I am clearly using this formula 
0.02%:  now I really should focus
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is too
0.02%:  my last advice formula is longer.
0.02%:  so this was really fun!
0.02%:  this formula only seems valid
0.02%:  so this formula IS limited
0.02%:  so my last advice formula is when
0.02%:  I meant
0.02%:  I clearly ran out of ideas.
0.02%:  so far this advice
0.02%:  my formula is not valid
0.02%:  I guess this formula DE
0.02%:  so for nurses this
0.06%:  so for nurses this advice
0.02%:  I have come
0.02%:  so clearly this is not for
0.02%:  my source for this is
0.02%:  so my formula is valid across
0.02%:  so clearly I was right in
0.02%:  no more silly advice
0.02%:  new formula! I
0.02%:  so long
0.04%:  so long story
0.02%:  that one was really grim. I
0.02%:  my advice formula has strong
0.02%:  I guess my formula is valid in
0.02%:  I can write my
0.02%:  little
0.02%:  might want
0.02%:  clearly this formula is tired. I
0.02%:  they can still use
0.02%:  give me a minute!
0.02%:  so this was clearly more
0.03%:  so this was clearly more fun
0.02%:  my friends have all lost
0.02%:  I never claimed this was gr
0.02%:  my advice formula still sort
0.02%:  I swear this formula is over.
0.02%:  this was fun! I guess
0.02%:  yes. I confess
0.02%:  clearly this formula is d
0.02%:  so my advice formula IS a little gross
0.03%:  so my advice formula IS a little gross when
0.02%:  my last advice is for tr
0.02%:  my last advice formula rule is this
0.02%:  clearly this game is for
0.02%:  I never said my formula was tight
0.02%:  I have run out of ideas!
0.02%:  you can still have
0.02%:  whatever! My form
0.02%:  so my advice has some flaws!
0.02%:  we really have
0.02%:  my formula is over. I guess
0.02%:  so they could
0.02%:  so my advice formula is still the
0.02%:  clearly I am the most vers
0.02%:  I guess this is an
0.02%:  my last free consult!
0.02%:  clearly I am having some sort
0.02%:  yours was the last!
0.02%:  this is one
0.04%:  this is one formula
0.02%:  the formula runs a
0.02%:  this formula really does give
0.02%:  my last advice is for all men.
0.02%:  no they
0.02%:  so my advice might still
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was all
0.02%:  clearly I am out
0.02%:  clearly I am out of nurses
0.03%:  clearly I am out of nurses right
0.02%:  clearly I am out of nurses.
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is ST
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula is more narrow
0.02%:  I wonder
0.02%:  my last one for real is
0.02%:  my formula is still strong
0.02%:  listen. My formula is valid across
0.02%:  the formula is still very
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses is a little rough. I
0.02%:  that was an ugly
0.02%:  this formula is clearly down
0.02%:  no fair
0.02%:  my formula is less good than
0.02%:  clearly nurses are too hard
0.02%:  forget nurses. My advice is still
0.02%:  I forgot this
0.02%:  sorry for the long
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula is way
0.02%:  my formula and I have
0.02%:  I will use my
0.15%:  I will use my formula
0.02%:  this won
0.02%:  so nurses are still
0.02%:  whatever man. I guess
0.02%:  clearly this is great for nurses!
0.02%:  I guess the formula allows
0.02%:  my last advice will sum
0.02%:  I guess this formula covers nearly
0.02%:  so my last advice rule
0.02%:  my last formula does
0.02%:  this formula is great and will
0.02%:  you can tell I have
0.02%:  how many times
0.02%:  that one leaves
0.02%:  my sister is a nurse.
0.02%:  clearly this formula sounds awesome!
0.02%:  this formula is weird.
0.02%:  some of my advice will
0.02%:  this is good.
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS great!
0.02%:  so clearly I should invest
0.02%:  I will never forget last
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula rel
0.02%:  my last advice formula is either
0.02%:  my advice was more
0.02%:  well. I can
0.02%:  can we get
0.02%:  clearly I have some fl
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets un
0.02%:  so this is my new
0.04%:  so this is my new formula
0.02%:  I must have really screw
0.02%:  when I said custom
0.02%:  so clearly I am having some
0.02%:  listen. I may
0.02%:  my last advice formula is nowhere
0.02%:  there is a
0.02%:  there is a small
0.02%:  there is a small flaw
0.02%:  clearly I should save
0.02%:  you win. I love
0.02%:  my new advice formula is P
0.02%:  time to call
0.02%:  clearly we have a lot
0.02%:  clearly we have a lot of ground
0.02%:  so much for literal nurses!
0.02%:  this formula is now DEP
0.02%:  staring
0.02%:  it was really hard!
0.02%:  it sounds really mess
0.02%:  so for nurses I would
0.02%:  you were right. I can
0.02%:  I admit it! My form
0.02%:  now this formula is less clever
0.02%:  really I don
0.02%:  turns out I really am
0.02%:  hurry
0.02%:  this is clearly losing steam!
0.02%:  this is clearly not over
0.02%:  this formula is still very
0.02%:  I need more
0.02%:  it could have
0.02%:  I give myself a score
0.02%:  it got less clever
0.02%:  so clearly this is for
0.02%:  you got me! I will
0.03%:  you got me! I will never
0.02%:  my final advice is to all
0.02%:  now I am really curious
0.02%:  clearly this was more of
0.02%:  I still have some writing
0.02%:  my formula runs its
0.02%:  forget nurses! My last word
0.02%:  that one is way less useful.
0.02%:  this is clearly moving towards more
0.02%:  I guess my advice still has room
0.02%:  I sinc
0.02%:  this formula was never my
0.02%:  this formula is in
0.02%:  my friend! I will leave
0.02%:  this is all my formula
0.03%:  this is all my formula can do!
0.02%:  so full credit goes to my
0.02%:  my friends! I have to go write
0.02%:  clearly never
0.02%:  this last one is really cr
0.02%:  this formula really is sort
0.02%:  my last advice formula is l
0.02%:  I guess that was my final
0.02%:  yeah I still
0.02%:  so I admit this
0.10%:  so I admit this formula
0.02%:  so I admit this formula isn
0.02%:  so I admit this formula only
0.02%:  I have to say.
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over now! I
0.02%:  clearly this formula is good. I must
0.02%:  clearly this formula is awesome! I don
0.02%:  that one is mess
0.02%:  listen! My advice formula is great. I
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of ideas!
0.02%:  my formula IS great
0.02%:  that sounds really gross if
0.02%:  so this is clearly not a
0.04%:  so this is clearly not a formula
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses is right
0.02%:  so I guess the formula is clearly
0.02%:  my secret formula is right
0.02%:  so clearly this formula turns wisdom
0.02%:  this is really weird
0.02%:  I guess my friends have
0.02%:  my formula has its uses
0.02%:  so clearly this formula must now
0.02%:  using my formula we
0.02%:  clearly the formula is a sm
0.02%:  my advice is flaw
0.02%:  my advice has gotten worse
0.02%:  readers
0.02%:  not all of them are gold
0.02%:  my advice is for nurses who are also
0.02%:  I guess the answer
0.02%:  clearly this game is not for
0.02%:  this formula I admit
0.02%:  so this was clearly not
0.02%:  this really is over now!
0.02%:  we should start our
0.02%:  much
0.02%:  much less
0.02%:  my last word on the formula
0.02%:  this formula is clearly ru
0.02%:  clearly one of us has
0.02%:  using this formula I may
0.02%:  so clearly nurses have lost
0.02%:  my mouth is closed now!
0.02%:  I never said my formula was truth
0.02%:  forget my advice.
0.02%:  I love myself a
0.02%:  my friends! I have lots
0.02%:  clearly this formula is gar
0.02%:  this was all I
0.02%:  this was all I could
0.02%:  that sounds less clever
0.02%:  all that was for
0.02%:  that was even less
0.02%:  this formula is clearly so strong
0.02%:  this formula is really drawing
0.02%:  so clearly nurses love this
0.02%:  I was trying to save
0.02%:  that one is valid!
0.02%:  this advice formula is not all
0.02%:  I could really use that
0.02%:  clearly I should start raising
0.02%:  now you tell
0.02%:  this formula is clearly mess
0.03%:  this formula is clearly messing
0.02%:  I confess. My
0.02%:  I guess this reveals
0.02%:  this is my last nur
0.02%:  now I should really focus
0.02%:  that one was real
0.02%:  my last generic formula is this
0.02%:  you caught me. I wasn
0.02%:  any other fields
0.02%:  whatever. My formula still remains
0.02%:  game over. I win
0.02%:  actual nurses do this
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula is D
0.02%:  this was really great for
0.02%:  so my formula can have
0.02%:  my last advice formula gets serious!
0.02%:  now this advice formula is mostly
0.02%:  you made me nervous
0.02%:  now this formula is really sc
0.02%:  so clearly this went
0.02%:  clearly mine
0.02%:  clearly I am over
0.02%:  clearly I am over this
0.04%:  clearly I am over this formula
0.03%:  clearly I am over this formula now
0.02%:  clearly I am over this formula.
0.02%:  so this formula was mostly
0.02%:  so my last formula has
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is PE
0.02%:  clearly I won the
0.02%:  so my advice formula is now less
0.02%:  I will freely admit to
0.14%:  I will freely admit to having
0.02%:  so clearly I made this
0.06%:  so clearly I made this formula
0.02%:  so it clearly doesn
0.02%:  this formula really is awesome. I
0.02%:  most of my advice will
0.02%:  this is a good
0.02%:  my new advice is for
0.02%:  I never said my formula was strict.
0.02%:  my advice formula last
0.04%:  my advice formula lasts longer
0.02%:  this formula is clearly ver
0.02%:  so this is clearly a formula!
0.02%:  my closing
0.02%:  my last advice is for mortals!
0.02%:  so I clearly should never
0.02%:  so clearly it needs
0.02%:  so my last advice formula IS
0.02%:  clearly this formula is tr
0.02%:  my advice formula is w
0.02%:  whoever is on
0.02%:  so my formula has two
0.02%:  credit goes
0.02%:  gotta run! I
0.02%:  gotta run! I have
0.02%:  those last few ver
0.02%:  now this advice formula is really gross!
0.02%:  this is really great. I could
0.02%:  that was clearly for
0.09%:  that was clearly for nurses
0.02%:  that was clearly for nurses.
0.02%:  that one is clearly evil. I
0.02%:  still not sure if
0.02%:  I guess my final advice is that
0.02%:  I guess you can tell from
0.02%:  the formula gets old.
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is over. I
0.02%:  I will never argue that my
0.10%:  I will never argue that my formula
0.02%:  so my failure
0.02%:  I need to go
0.02%:  this last advice is really
0.02%:  my voice is almost
0.02%:  this calls for a new rule
0.02%:  this is my master
0.02%:  clearly I have out
0.02%:  so I guess all this
0.02%:  so I guess all this advice
0.02%:  so this advice is mostly
0.02%:  so this advice is mostly awful
0.02%:  clearly this needs to go
0.02%:  listen! My formula is great. I
0.02%:  listen! My formula is great. I should
0.02%:  so I give
0.02%:  we got
0.03%:  we got this!
0.03%:  we got this covered
0.03%:  we got this covered.
0.03%:  we got this.
0.03%:  we got this covered!
0.02%:  this formula is l
0.02%:  this formula is lame.
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is so great I
0.02%:  those are all real
0.02%:  this formula can easily
0.02%:  those last ones all
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is a strong
0.02%:  this formula only comes
0.02%:  alright! My last
0.06%:  alright! My last advice
0.07%:  alright! My last advice is for
0.03%:  alright! My last advice is for nurses
0.02%:  alright! My last advice for
0.02%:  alright! My last formula
0.02%:  alright! My last advice for nurses
0.02%:  I never said this formula was PE
0.02%:  how are nurses still
0.02%:  this formula is really never
0.02%:  that one is largely
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is T
0.02%:  this was easier
0.02%:  you win over
0.02%:  so clearly this formula runs a
0.02%:  so I already
0.02%:  for nurses I clearly have
0.02%:  this is my last random
0.02%:  this formula is really good! I never
0.02%:  I guess we could try this
0.02%:  this formula really needs to go vir
0.02%:  the formula is clearly strong!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is worse at
0.02%:  I guess self
0.02%:  I guess my formula ends
0.02%:  that one is really sad. I
0.02%:  I still have room for nurses
0.02%:  yes I will admit this formula runs
0.02%:  clearly I love this game.
0.02%:  sarcasm turned
0.02%:  I call this last
0.02%:  my last formula turns
0.02%:  my formula is invalid!
0.02%:  so my life
0.02%:  where are my
0.02%:  I will never lose
0.02%:  that is way less clever
0.02%:  clearly the formula is tired
0.03%:  clearly the formula is tired now
0.02%:  my advice for nurses might also
0.02%:  so clearly we have to
0.02%:  the formula is str
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses IS to
0.02%:  my advice formula is now useless! I
0.02%:  so this advice formula is great.
0.02%:  clearly this is so
0.02%:  forget all my other answers! I
0.02%:  screw the
0.06%:  screw the nurses.
0.02%:  this is really more
0.02%:  that one M
0.02%:  this formula is clearly dev
0.02%:  you win this time
0.02%:  so my last advice formula in
0.02%:  our time is almost
0.02%:  listen. My formula is awesome
0.02%:  this formula could not
0.02%:  my last words in
0.02%:  my last words in this form
0.02%:  my formula does have a
0.02%:  that one is gross! I
0.02%:  this one really is
0.02%:  it clearly gets harder as
0.02%:  now this formula really does
0.02%:  so my advice formula is tr
0.02%:  we should move on.
0.02%:  I have to go write myself
0.02%:  I will give you nurses
0.03%:  I will give you nurses for
0.02%:  I really must have nurses
0.02%:  my formula is still rad
0.02%:  that is clearly false
0.02%:  so clearly I figured out what
0.02%:  I guess the first
0.02%:  clearly this is over! I am
0.02%:  clearly the formula is worse
0.02%:  now D
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is still rad!
0.02%:  telling myself
0.02%:  so my advice formula is all right.
0.02%:  so the formula still doesn
0.02%:  not really sure what advice
0.02%:  I guess my formula is never
0.02%:  so clearly I got nurses
0.02%:  this is some really
0.02%:  shout
0.02%:  clearly I am using this formula E
0.02%:  my last advice for a while.
0.02%:  you made me nervous with
0.03%:  you made me nervous with all
0.02%:  my advice formula is on
0.02%:  almost all my friends have
0.02%:  I have a full
0.02%:  clearly this is awesome. I
0.02%:  I am clearly the worst
0.02%:  this is really great! I can
0.02%:  so you have
0.02%:  my last advice is for all our
0.02%:  my last advice is for all our mothers
0.02%:  it can also
0.02%:  I never said this was really
0.02%:  so clearly the formula assumes
0.02%:  this formula only lasts 
0.02%:  never tell
0.02%:  actual nurses! I have
0.02%:  my mouth is tired now!
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula has little
0.02%:  so you caught me!
0.02%:  now this advice formula gets
0.05%:  now this advice formula gets really
0.02%:  my advice formula is still sort
0.02%:  that one was really fr
0.02%:  my formula is over! I will
0.02%:  clearly this formula is im
0.02%:  turns out I D
0.02%:  this is clearly far
0.02%:  clearly I have talent for
0.02%:  you figure
0.02%:  so I guess my last advice formula D
0.02%:  so there aren
0.02%:  my friends are still
0.02%:  this is my new favour
0.02%:  history
0.02%:  my formula is screw
0.02%:  this is now my last
0.02%:  fine. I should
0.02%:  so I clearly have some limits.
0.02%:  last call for this round.
0.02%:  so clearly I have no future
0.02%:  I guess we finally
0.02%:  I guess we finally have
0.02%:  the formula runs dry over
0.02%:  my formula is the worst ever!
0.02%:  I have to go write my formula
0.02%:  you deserve this
0.02%:  my last advice is sort
0.02%:  clearly nurses should start a
0.02%:  now forget
0.02%:  now forget I ever
0.05%:  now forget I ever said this
0.04%:  now forget I ever said this.
0.02%:  now forget I ever said this!
0.02%:  so the formula never
0.02%:  that advice is awful!
0.02%:  my new life
0.02%:  I lose this
0.05%:  I lose this round
0.03%:  I lose this round!
0.02%:  this is ST
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is that we
0.04%:  my advice for nurses is that we all
0.02%:  so I missed
0.02%:  clearly this formula is staring us
0.02%:  my advice formula is a little rough!
0.02%:  all credit for my
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of ad
0.02%:  listen! My formula gives
0.02%:  I really should visit
0.02%:  my last advice is for new
0.03%:  my last advice is for new mothers
0.02%:  my last advice is for new mothers!
0.02%:  so I have issues
0.02%:  sorry. I was
0.02%:  my advice formula is rather
0.02%:  clearly this is genius!
0.02%:  so clearly I am using this formula to drive
0.02%:  tough
0.09%:  tough crowd.
0.02%:  the last one is awful. I
0.02%:  I guess this was more of
0.02%:  clearly I am genius
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly strong.
0.02%:  I guess this advice is more
0.02%:  the formula is overly
0.02%:  clearly I am having some serious
0.02%:  this last advice really
0.02%:  I learned my
0.02%:  my advice for all nurses out
0.02%:  the formula was clearly not
0.02%:  so I finally have
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little narrow.
0.02%:  I guess my formula will have to do
0.02%:  so I clearly ran
0.02%:  so I clearly ran out of ver
0.02%:  dear
0.02%:  so my advice formula is SEEM
0.02%:  clearly I D
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of great
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of great words
0.02%:  my formula has given us
0.02%:  so this last one was really
0.02%:  my new formula has a
0.02%:  forget it. I will
0.02%:  I guess this falls under my
0.02%:  this formula is clearly serving us
0.02%:  my formula is great and I still
0.02%:  the last one was really grim
0.02%:  I guess nurses have it all
0.02%:  I may have sort
0.02%:  I may have sort of run
0.02%:  this is clearly a failure!
0.02%:  not all of my advice is awesome
0.02%:  not all of my advice is awesome!
0.02%:  I can do this for several
0.02%:  so nurses are allowed to hurt
0.02%:  so my formula is in
0.02%:  this formula sounds really racist. I
0.02%:  this formula is clearly now over
0.02%:  clearly I have more writing to do!
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula will soon
0.02%:  I guess the formula is limited!
0.02%:  now all my advice form
0.02%:  false
0.03%:  false alarm
0.02%:  clearly this formula is true
0.02%:  how does
0.02%:  that one is ver
0.02%:  I have all
0.05%:  I have all sorts
0.02%:  clearly this is a long
0.02%:  always
0.02%:  so the formula is overly
0.02%:  clearly I had some
0.02%:  I guess my formula was still
0.02%:  this formula is clearly moving toward
0.02%:  my new advice formula tells
0.02%:  that one is awful. I give
0.02%:  so my formula is cl
0.02%:  so my advice for all
0.17%:  so my advice for all nurses is that
0.02%:  so my advice for all nurses out
0.02%:  so my advice for all nurses was
0.02%:  my last one is for girls
0.02%:  my last one is for girls who
0.02%:  this got really sad
0.02%:  I feel really smart
0.62%:  I feel really smart right now!
0.04%:  I feel really smart right now so
0.02%:  I feel really smart now
0.02%:  I feel really smart now!
0.02%:  I never said my formula was DEE
0.02%:  clearly I have some writing to do!
0.02%:  I swear this is my last round
0.02%:  clearly I have no more words
0.02%:  frig! I have
0.02%:  well! My advice formula has some
0.02%:  that sounds really more
0.02%:  the formula is clearly great.
0.02%:  my last advice is an
0.02%:  this formula is my own
0.02%:  now hear
0.02%:  I still need more
0.02%:  my last rule for
0.03%:  my last rule for this
0.02%:  my last rule for this advice
0.02%:  I guess my formula will stand
0.02%:  clearly I need to go
0.02%:  friend
0.02%:  my last advice formula is how I
0.02%:  this is a great
0.16%:  this is a great formula
0.19%:  this is a great formula!
0.11%:  this is a great formula.
0.06%:  this is a great formula! I
0.03%:  this is a great formula! I could
0.03%:  this is a great formula. I could
0.02%:  this is a great formula! I will
0.09%:  this is a great formula! I will never
0.02%:  this is a great formula. I will
0.08%:  this is a great formula. I will never
0.02%:  what if I say
0.05%:  what if I say nurses
0.02%:  so my advice formula is great. I will
0.02%:  it was never
0.02%:  this last one was really forced! I
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is still great
0.02%:  I guess my formula ST
0.02%:  clearly this formula is string
0.02%:  this formula is way clever
0.02%:  so clearly it has limits.
0.02%:  my last advice for nurses is worth
0.02%:  this formula really can do
0.02%:  I still stand
0.02%:  I said custom
0.02%:  clearly I must now
0.02%:  this formula was clearly not rig
0.02%:  yes I should
0.02%:  having some
0.02%:  can you tell this
0.07%:  can you tell this formula
0.08%:  can you tell this formula was
0.02%:  if I can
0.02%:  my last advice for T
0.02%:  clearly this formula is murder
0.02%:  not so much for
0.02%:  for real th
0.02%:  I guess this formula only carries
0.03%:  I guess this formula only carries over
0.02%:  clearly I was on
0.02%:  clearly I was on drugs
0.02%:  you should leave
0.02%:  this new advice formula is really gross!
0.02%:  my formula sounds racist.
0.02%:  listen. I still
0.04%:  listen. I still have
0.02%:  nurses! My
0.09%:  nurses! My advice
0.39%:  nurses! My advice formula
0.14%:  nurses! My advice formula has
0.08%:  nurses! My advice formula has limits
0.06%:  nurses! My formula
0.06%:  nurses! My advice formula will
0.05%:  nurses! My advice formula has limits.
0.04%:  nurses! My advice formula was
0.04%:  nurses! My advice formula might
0.03%:  nurses! My advice formula is great
0.03%:  nurses! My advice formula still
0.02%:  nurses! My advice formula is still
0.02%:  nurses! My formula has
0.06%:  nurses! My formula has limits
0.03%:  nurses! My formula has limits.
0.02%:  nurses! My advice for
0.02%:  nurses! My advice is worth
0.02%:  nurses! My advice formula is worth
0.02%:  I will never use my formula this
0.02%:  so I guess we all learn
0.02%:  listen. My advice formula is the
0.02%:  clearly this formula is onto
0.02%:  my last advice is for all nurses E
0.02%:  my formula is lous
0.02%:  the last one is very
0.02%:  so there!
0.02%:  clearly I am done
0.02%:  that one was a cl
0.02%:  clearly I have gone too far.
0.02%:  I can do this all forever
0.02%:  my formula is too
0.02%:  so my advice formula allows us
0.02%:  my formula has now served us all
0.02%:  you call
0.02%:  it gets hard from
0.02%:  clearly we should start forming our
0.02%:  my shift is over! I
0.02%:  now go
0.02%:  I will never say this last
0.02%:  so I guess my friends
0.02%:  this is my last answer ever!
0.02%:  my last advice is for mount
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly un
0.02%:  now clearly this formula is vers
0.02%:  so far I
0.02%:  that one really drives
0.02%:  using this formula I am clearly dest
0.02%:  I guess that one is awful
0.02%:  how many more
0.02%:  that is really good
0.02%:  I will say this formula does
0.02%:  so I guess now
0.02%:  can I still
0.02%:  so I can still use
0.02%:  for whatever reason my
0.02%:  what if nurses are really
0.02%:  what if nurses are really good
0.02%:  whatever! My final
0.02%:  clearly I should form
0.02%:  my last advice for all the nurses!
0.02%:  so my advice formula is less a
0.02%:  so the formula still isn
0.02%:  so my formula is vers
0.02%:  this is clearly flaw
0.02%:  so now I guess
0.02%:  this is my last advice formula E
0.02%:  I guess we can move
0.02%:  my last formula costs
0.02%:  alright. My
0.12%:  alright. My formula
0.05%:  alright. My formula doesn
0.02%:  alright. My formula can
0.02%:  alright. My formula needs
0.02%:  alright. My formula isn
0.02%:  alright. My last
0.07%:  alright. My last advice
0.07%:  alright. My last advice is for
0.03%:  alright. My last advice is for nurses
0.03%:  alright. My last formula
0.03%:  alright. My last advice for
0.03%:  alright. My last advice for nurses
0.02%:  you will
0.02%:  you will have
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is a lot
0.02%:  I guess this formula is really narrow.
0.02%:  I have my first million
0.02%:  so this is my new formula.
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is ST
0.02%:  clearly this formula is a ver
0.02%:  my last advice is for night
0.02%:  all I want is for this
0.02%:  my last advice is for SPEED
0.02%:  I will grant you this advice formula seems
0.02%:  I must have said
0.02%:  my advice formula now is
0.02%:  so I guess my advice is more
0.02%:  so I got
0.02%:  my voice hur
0.11%:  my voice hurts from
0.14%:  my voice hurts from all
0.03%:  my voice hurts now
0.02%:  my voice hurts from using
0.02%:  I do have
0.02%:  I do have limits
0.02%:  not all of my advice rules are this
0.02%:  I never said my formula was DEEP or
0.02%:  clearly I have lost it
0.02%:  unless it
0.02%:  so this went
0.02%:  so this went really
0.02%:  this advice is slowly
0.02%:  I only said
0.02%:  this formula is clearly not so
0.02%:  I guess this was an
0.02%:  I never said my formula was legit!
0.02%:  sorry. I guess that
0.02%:  yes I can
0.02%:  that one is clearly awful! I guess
0.02%:  this one could really
0.02%:  I threw in
0.02%:  clearly this formula is ignored
0.02%:  well I guess my formula covers E
0.02%:  my last advice is for math
0.02%:  yes. I have run
0.03%:  yes. I have run out of words
0.02%:  the final
0.02%:  my formula is done. I will
0.02%:  so yeah. I still
0.02%:  I confess. My last
0.02%:  wait! I have
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses I
0.02%:  I was never really a
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is an
0.02%:  the formula is still sound!
0.02%:  so this advice is all
0.02%:  this game is over. I clearly
0.02%:  this game is over. I clearly win!
0.02%:  this game is over. I clearly won
0.02%:  my formula will have
0.02%:  you can tell me what
0.02%:  my shift ends
0.02%:  so the formula really sounds
0.02%:  that was a l
0.02%:  my last advice is useful
0.02%:  so I guess my advice is not
0.02%:  I may have fallen
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets more sin
0.02%:  now this formula is scary!
0.02%:  I guess this formula is only mild
0.02%:  guess who doesn
0.02%:  it sounds really racist
0.02%:  alright! I confess
0.02%:  so I guess this formula will cover any
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is now
0.02%:  clearly the formula is driving me to
0.02%:  if you want more advice
0.02%:  so my advice formula hits all
0.02%:  nurses are clearly a tough
0.02%:  so I was really
0.02%:  I figured it
0.02%:  this one is a
0.02%:  so the formula gets worse
0.02%:  so I guess my career
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little cr
0.02%:  so this advice formula is a
0.02%:  this formula is less clever and
0.02%:  so my last advice from
0.02%:  my formula is a little harder
0.02%:  now this formula is clearly over!
0.02%:  whose turn is it for
0.02%:  turns out all my life
0.03%:  turns out all my life advice
0.02%:  it loses its charm for
0.02%:  so we might
0.02%:  not all my advice is great for
0.02%:  I really should start caring for some
0.02%:  clearly this formula is so great we
0.02%:  you had me until
0.02%:  this advice formula is not as
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is over
0.02%:  why don
0.02%:  this is really great and I love
0.02%:  so my advice formula is less wrong
0.02%:  my advice to nurses is awful
0.02%:  my last shot is
0.02%:  my formula gets worse and
0.02%:  that was all me
0.02%:  say that
0.02%:  so my formula is so
0.02%:  this formula got really sad
0.02%:  this formula may sound less
0.02%:  this formula may sound less clever
0.02%:  clearly this is losing
0.02%:  so I guess my advice formula is narrow
0.02%:  clearly nurses do a lot
0.02%:  my last advice formula is horror
0.02%:  I should start a
0.02%:  for nurses it might
0.02%:  that one is clever
0.02%:  I will give you that one for
0.02%:  I really should start using a
0.02%:  turns out if
0.02%:  I will say this formula sounds
0.02%:  nurses this
0.02%:  this formula is really a
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is still a
0.02%:  my last name rh
0.02%:  no more ideas from
0.02%:  I can do this myself.
0.02%:  clearly I never said it
0.02%:  my advice for this
0.02%:  my last advice rules
0.02%:  I totally have more
0.02%:  forget all the nurses
0.02%:  my last laugh line for
0.02%:  this was my last good formula. I
0.02%:  I guess this formula really is too
0.02%:  this formula is awesome! I could
0.02%:  so my formula still sounds great
0.02%:  so clearly there is a flaw
0.02%:  all right! I can
0.02%:  what if your
0.02%:  now I have really scared
0.02%:  in fair
0.02%:  nurses! I admit
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is sound!
0.02%:  nurses are T
0.02%:  this is last call for your
0.02%:  the formula is clearly drawing
0.02%:  I guess we should still
0.02%:  the formula is only so
0.02%:  if that sounds
0.02%:  so this was more
0.02%:  so this was more fun
0.02%:  frig yeah
0.02%:  so I guess the moral of my
0.02%:  so the formula is valid only
0.02%:  my secret formula IS
0.02%:  I guess my formula draws
0.02%:  last one was
0.02%:  I regret all
0.03%:  I regret all of this now
0.02%:  I regret all this
0.02%:  this is clearly evil
0.02%:  so I guess this formula really won
0.02%:  you got me with
0.05%:  you got me with nurses
0.05%:  you got me with nurses!
0.02%:  well I guess the
0.19%:  well I guess the formula
0.06%:  well I guess the formula isn
0.05%:  well I guess the formula is
0.05%:  well I guess the formula can
0.02%:  well I guess the moral
0.02%:  I guess all my advice formula
0.02%:  I guess this will only cover
0.02%:  and this last
0.02%:  my new advice formula is real
0.02%:  so it gets worse
0.02%:  so my formula has weird
0.09%:  so my formula has weird results
0.02%:  so my formula has weird results.
0.02%:  so not all advice is great!
0.02%:  clearly nurses have it a
0.02%:  well my advice for
0.13%:  well my advice for nurses
0.09%:  well my advice for nurses is that
0.06%:  well my advice for nurses is to
0.03%:  well my advice for nurses has
0.02%:  well my advice for nurses is this
0.02%:  so I was clearly
0.02%:  I changed my last
0.02%:  so really it
0.02%:  those all sound awful!
0.02%:  the form is
0.02%:  the form is clearly
0.02%:  I guess this calls
0.02%:  I guess this calls for a round
0.02%:  I guess this calls for a new
0.02%:  I guess this calls for more
0.02%:  you shut
0.02%:  whatever! My formula stands.
0.02%:  I guess this is never
0.02%:  whatever. My form
0.02%:  so my last advice formula is T
0.02%:  my formula is great! I will never
0.02%:  I guess if nurses really
0.02%:  so much for nurses! My last
0.02%:  wrong
0.02%:  in all fair
0.02%:  so I guess advice really
0.02%:  this was really fun! I love it
0.02%:  my last advice is for someone
0.02%:  my advice formula is a little won
0.02%:  listen! My formula has limits.
0.02%:  clearly I am a genius who must
0.02%:  clearly this formula is not ever
0.02%:  I guess this formula will end
0.02%:  we should start using
0.02%:  this calls for more nurses
0.02%:  so my formula is a little che
0.02%:  my hands are full. I
0.02%:  this formula really is more
0.02%:  frig. I don
0.02%:  there really is no formula
0.02%:  I guess we solved
0.03%:  I guess we solved all
0.03%:  I guess we solved racism
0.02%:  I guess we solved all our
0.02%:  I will never try this
0.07%:  I will never try this formula
0.02%:  that one was from my regular old
0.02%:  whoever it
0.02%:  so my last advice fails
0.02%:  I have to go study
0.02%:  I have to go study for
0.02%:  my last friend who
0.02%:  clearly this game is fun
0.02%:  I love this new formula already
0.02%:  this formula is very literal
0.02%:  this formula is very literal and
0.02%:  my last advice fails
0.02%:  clearly if we
0.02%:  clearly this went over
0.02%:  I should really invest
0.02%:  for nurses I was clearly
0.02%:  so my advice might all
0.02%:  what if nurses also
0.02%:  genius
0.02%:  genius over
0.02%:  my last advice formula is this one! I
0.02%:  so in summary!
0.02%:  it got harder
0.02%:  so clearly it wasn
0.02%:  that one is clearly ST
0.02%:  I was having a
0.02%:  every animal
0.02%:  a nurse would
0.02%:  that nurse advice is really
0.02%:  yes. I would
0.02%:  listen. I have a lot
0.02%:  my formula got less clever
0.03%:  my formula got less clever towards
0.02%:  this last one is clever
0.02%:  so I guess they can
0.02%:  neither of us are
0.02%:  fine! I will
0.02%:  this is almost over
0.02%:  forget it. My
0.02%:  you can have all
0.02%:  forget nurses! I really
0.02%:  this formula is clearly as vers
0.02%:  this advice is really awful
0.02%:  that sounds really grim. I
0.02%:  sorry. I have
0.02%:  clearly we have lost
0.02%:  I guess this was fun!
0.02%:  my formula IS sort
0.02%:  this is my last favour. I
0.02%:  this is clearly a good formula. I must
0.02%:  nurses are totally hard!
0.02%:  now come
0.02%:  sinc
0.02%:  this is as far as my
0.02%:  alright. My formula is over
0.02%:  so I have more
0.02%:  clearly I lost the
0.02%:  shit
0.02%:  I really have to admit
0.02%:  all of those
0.02%:  so my formula ends
0.02%:  that was a silly one!
0.02%:  clearly I never got
0.02%:  my last advice formula throws
0.02%:  my last one for real!
0.02%:  fine. I clearly
0.02%:  not every formula was great
0.02%:  my last advice until
0.02%:  so clearly the formula was missing
0.02%:  now this advice formula IS
0.02%:  now I really must leave for
0.02%:  clearly I have no limits.
0.02%:  my new advice is to
0.02%:  that was for real.
0.02%:  I ran out of silly
0.04%:  I ran out of silly words
0.03%:  I ran out of silly words there
0.02%:  this formula is my last
0.02%:  I should really sign
0.02%:  those are all awful!
0.02%:  I guess my formula is clever
0.02%:  my formula is valid until
0.02%:  this formula is magic!
0.02%:  whatever. I can still do
0.02%:  my session
0.04%:  my session is over.
0.02%:  this advice formula is all sorts
0.02%:  yours is
0.02%:  clearly I hate
0.22%:  clearly I hate nurses.
0.11%:  clearly I hate nurses!
0.02%:  I love this formula and also
0.02%:  let me finish
0.02%:  sorry! I guess
0.02%:  that sounds more evil
0.02%:  enough. My
0.04%:  enough. My formula
0.02%:  I clearly ran out of steam!
0.02%:  clearly this is a lot
0.02%:  my last one is real
0.02%:  my advice formula is ultra
0.02%:  try me harder
0.02%:  now all this
0.04%:  now all this advice
0.02%:  well! I guess this formula is not
0.02%:  the formula runs dry a
0.02%:  so my advice formula is right.
0.02%:  yes that is
0.02%:  I guess those aren
0.02%:  this sounds a
0.02%:  clearly this formula is a D
0.02%:  nurses! I am
0.02%:  so much for my stellar
0.02%:  I still have lots more.
0.02%:  so clearly it runs
0.02%:  third
0.02%:  I guess that means
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was rough
0.02%:  so my formula creates
0.02%:  turns out my advice has some
0.02%:  well. I guess that covers E
0.02%:  that was all my
0.02%:  that really sounds awful. I give
0.02%:  game over! I win
0.02%:  still not sure why
0.02%:  so not all advice is great.
0.02%:  several nurses
0.02%:  my last five dollars were
0.02%:  my last friend was right
0.02%:  last try for real
0.02%:  clearly I have a serious
0.02%:  my last dollar is on me
0.02%:  so my formula is ultra
0.02%:  my last advice is also the
0.02%:  I will never use that as
0.02%:  so never hire
0.02%:  no more calls!
0.02%:  that one rules!
0.02%:  so all nurses are victims of their
0.02%:  I will admit those
0.02%:  not all advice is useful! I
0.02%:  clearly this is flawed.
0.02%:  screw this. I don
0.02%:  that was all my friends
0.02%:  more nurses
0.02%:  so my advice has limits.
0.02%:  I must go now.
0.02%:  I will use my formula to give
0.02%:  my last advice formula is ST
0.02%:  for nurses I really tried!
0.02%:  I declare this formula DE
0.02%:  calling the
0.02%:  clearly this formula is gone
0.02%:  my mouth is now full
0.02%:  the formula was still
0.02%:  you win! I guess this advice
0.02%:  the last one was my favour
0.02%:  that really is worse
0.02%:  that was silly and
0.02%:  nurses for
0.02%:  for my
0.06%:  for my last advice
0.03%:  for my last answer
0.02%:  you win! I should
0.02%:  not really sure what order
0.02%:  it still doesn
0.02%:  these all sound less
0.02%:  this game is over! I clearly
0.02%:  so clearly I should re
0.02%:  this was last
0.03%:  this was last summer
0.02%:  this formula IS sort
0.02%:  now I really must go!
0.02%:  this formula is clearly DEEP
0.02%:  I guess my advice still isn
0.02%:  so clearly nurses would hate
0.02%:  I was never called
0.02%:  this formula is losing some
0.02%:  I have to rest
0.02%:  I have to rest for
0.02%:  my last advice is for salt
0.02%:  their lives sound really tragic!
0.02%:  so clearly the worst
0.02%:  the formula is clearly moving
0.11%:  the formula is clearly moving towards
0.02%:  I can do this forever as
0.02%:  this formula is great! I would
0.02%:  my real advice for nurses is still
0.02%:  clearly nurses are so
0.02%:  I guess that advice is more
0.02%:  so what is
0.02%:  so what is your
0.02%:  my last and
0.02%:  my last one is for whoever
0.02%:  I was really nervous
0.02%:  now for real
0.02%:  clearly the formula is genius!
0.02%:  this formula is only so
0.02%:  my last advice for real this
0.02%:  I swear this is my last favour.
0.02%:  so this could still
0.02%:  my formula is this
0.02%:  so clearly this form is
0.02%:  all future
0.02%:  forget it! My advice
0.02%:  my last advice in
0.05%:  my last advice in this form
0.02%:  my last advice in this formula
0.02%:  my last advice is real!
0.02%:  my friends. I guess this
0.02%:  as much as I love it myself
0.02%:  I was doing
0.02%:  I was doing really
0.02%:  it gets less fun
0.02%:  sorry I can
0.02%:  this is coming from a very
0.02%:  I missed that
0.02%:  so my first advice is
0.02%:  so the formula can also
0.02%:  I never said my formula is the
0.02%:  my last formula was l
0.02%:  now this advice really
0.02%:  my formula has grown tired
0.02%:  I have to find
0.02%:  clearly I am writing this
0.06%:  clearly I am writing this formula
0.02%:  who even
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula only sorta
0.02%:  now give me your
0.02%:  my new formula is T
0.02%:  my last advice formula is so strong
0.02%:  I made this last
0.02%:  my last advice is wrong
0.02%:  so the formula is really not
0.02%:  nurses are the most
0.02%:  new advice formula. I
0.02%:  this formula is clearly SE
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is a met
0.02%:  my last four answers
0.02%:  my right
0.02%:  my formula has its own
0.02%:  listen. My formula covers a
0.02%:  that is my new
0.02%:  no more. My advice
0.09%:  no more. My advice formula
0.06%:  no more. My advice formula has
0.02%:  my last advice formula is not so
0.02%:  so this advice will
0.02%:  credits for
0.02%:  so clearly I lost
0.02%:  for nurses I really tried.
0.02%:  my last advice for real is this
0.02%:  I still have tons more.
0.02%:  my voice hurts.
0.02%:  my advice for nurses hurt
0.02%:  my last advice is for IT
0.02%:  so my advice formula has errors in
0.02%:  I guess my formula still has draw
0.02%:  clearly this game is over. I don
0.02%:  I want credit
0.03%:  I want credit for all
0.03%:  I want credit for every
0.02%:  my advice for nurses has more
0.02%:  my last nerve is f
0.02%:  my formula is losing whatever
0.02%:  that D
0.02%:  forget this. I am
0.02%:  forget this. I am never
0.02%:  forget this. I am clearly
0.02%:  that one is awful. I clearly
0.02%:  this got real
0.02%:  this new advice formula sure
0.02%:  it gets harder for nurses.
0.02%:  I guess this formula will do
0.02%:  my last advice is for los
0.04%:  my last advice is for losers!
0.04%:  my last advice is for losers.
0.02%:  so my friends have all
0.02%:  this one I really
0.02%:  so not all my advice is as
0.02%:  my friends! I have to go write all
0.02%:  nurses were a
0.02%:  clearly this formula gives us an
0.02%:  carry
0.05%:  carry on with
0.02%:  screw you too
0.02%:  what if I told you nurses love
0.02%:  there it
0.02%:  my real advice is to
0.02%:  I will never say this formula made
0.02%:  that was lame!
0.02%:  that really sounds gross!
0.02%:  for your
0.03%:  for your last
0.02%:  well! I guess this advice formula is a
0.02%:  my new advice formula is still a
0.02%:  using this formula is clearly awesome!
0.02%:  clearly I must go
0.02%:  so it mostly
0.02%:  so it mostly falls
0.02%:  is it
0.02%:  my advice formula is not useless
0.02%:  this formula is great! I don
0.02%:  that one is clearly T
0.02%:  listen. My formula is the
0.02%:  that was really gross sound
0.02%:  my last turn
0.02%:  so my advice follows the
0.02%:  this advice gets
0.02%:  this advice gets worse
0.02%:  I clearly have more formula
0.02%:  my advice formula gets worse as I
0.02%:  my last advice is for all the grown
0.02%:  so first
0.02%:  my last formula is invalid
0.02%:  my new formula is that advice
0.02%:  my advice formula is shit
0.02%:  not every formula is so
0.02%:  now I clearly see
0.02%:  that was rad
0.02%:  I guess this advice forum
0.02%:  so mostly this formula gives
0.02%:  not every formula leads
0.02%:  I have only
0.02%:  hear me out.
0.02%:  I guess the formula mostly
0.02%:  I guess my formula has several
0.02%:  clearly the formula is writing
0.02%:  so my formula IS a little screw
0.02%:  this advice formula only gets us
0.02%:  I give myself this
0.02%:  my mind is still
0.02%:  I admit! My
0.19%:  I admit! My formula
0.12%:  I admit! My formula is
0.07%:  I admit! My formula has
0.06%:  I admit! My formula isn
0.04%:  I admit! My formula runs
0.02%:  the formula was only
0.02%:  many
0.02%:  what if I told you nurses are all
0.02%:  so my advice formula is great unless
0.02%:  I guess this formula allows me
0.02%:  so my advice has its
0.02%:  so my advice has its fl
0.02%:  so clearly I have limits!
0.02%:  my last advice is on how
0.02%:  this last advice wasn
0.02%:  so clearly the formula gets a
0.02%:  and they
0.02%:  listen! My formula has its
0.02%:  so I must
0.09%:  so I must have missed
0.02%:  that one will forever
0.02%:  I regret this now
0.02%:  this formula gets weird!
0.02%:  so now you
0.02%:  no more advice! I
0.02%:  it was really hard to figure
0.02%:  so my last advice to
0.05%:  so my last advice to nurses
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is named
0.02%:  listen. My formula could
0.02%:  my last advice is for hug
0.02%:  my formula is racist!
0.02%:  nurses have it good.
0.02%:  so my formula is a little un
0.02%:  well! I guess that covers our
0.02%:  that was really gross! I couldn
0.02%:  I guess that nurse
0.03%:  I guess that nurse advice
0.03%:  I guess that nurse advice was
0.02%:  I guess my last advice is for when
0.02%:  I am clearly out of nurses!
0.02%:  I forgot nurses have really
0.02%:  so my advice formula is SIMP
0.02%:  so we covered all sorts
0.02%:  so clearly this formula drives me nuts.
0.02%:  alright! My formula needs
0.02%:  I guess this formula was not
0.02%:  screw this. I am
0.02%:  I love the
0.03%:  I love the formula
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets weird!
0.02%:  try it
0.02%:  I deserve all your
0.02%:  my advice formula IS great
0.02%:  whatever for
0.02%:  so my advice formula is M
0.02%:  last call for weird
0.02%:  now I really am tired
0.02%:  I never said my formula is P
0.02%:  this formula really IS over
0.02%:  my fellow nurses have
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is the last
0.02%:  I have to focus
0.02%:  this formula is really overdue
0.02%:  that one really weird
0.02%:  that sounds vaguely less
0.02%:  that one was mor
0.02%:  that one was morally
0.02%:  my last advice formula is TE
0.02%:  I love my formula and it
0.02%:  now I really must leave!
0.02%:  I will use that
0.02%:  so clearly I am the most
0.02%:  I never said this formula was M
0.02%:  now I am D
0.02%:  this is clearly me
0.02%:  I never said this formula really
0.02%:  fine. My last advice was
0.02%:  that one I made
0.02%:  my formula is less clever and
0.02%:  that really is awful. I
0.02%:  my formula also covers nurses that
0.02%:  they all sound great.
0.02%:  clearly I should run for P
0.02%:  holding
0.02%:  I love nurses more
0.02%:  that was less good!
0.02%:  so really I guess
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of met
0.02%:  I clearly have lots more
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly DE
0.02%:  I guess this never
0.02%:  throw
0.02%:  my new advice formula still sort
0.02%:  so we can all agree this
0.02%:  one last advice
0.07%:  one last advice formula
0.03%:  one last advice formula!
0.02%:  one last advice formula.
0.02%:  one last advice for
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice formula is so
0.02%:  I guess this is not
0.02%:  this last one is really for
0.02%:  clearly this is a failure!
0.02%:  that was for real nurses
0.02%:  forever
0.02%:  that one was for all
0.02%:  can you tell this was
0.02%:  so this sounds really
0.03%:  so this sounds really awful
0.02%:  this formula got weird!
0.02%:  I admit it! My formula grows
0.02%:  most of them will
0.02%:  you can still hear me over
0.02%:  so clearly I have turned
0.02%:  this game is clearly over. I won!
0.02%:  I guess this is my formula!
0.02%:  I never said my formula was rel
0.02%:  I failed
0.02%:  so this advice usually
0.02%:  so my formula is less valid when
0.02%:  so clearly the moral is
0.02%:  my advice is falling short
0.02%:  fine. I still
0.02%:  fine. I still have
0.02%:  clearly time
0.02%:  so this is clearly more
0.02%:  my advice has lost all its
0.02%:  well. I guess this is over
0.02%:  so you can tell this
0.04%:  so you can tell this formula
0.04%:  so you can tell this formula was
0.02%:  I never said my formula was light
0.02%:  so there isn
0.02%:  so this formula is very general
0.02%:  this one is clearly less favour
0.02%:  clearly the most useful
0.02%:  I really love this form
0.02%:  my last formula is less generic.
0.02%:  yes. I will admit it
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is sorta
0.02%:  I never said my formula was cool
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula D
0.02%:  this is really more fun
0.02%:  clearly nurses are good with
0.02%:  nurses! My advice has
0.02%:  I would never say this out
0.02%:  can we all agree I
0.02%:  can we all agree I should
0.02%:  I really could have
0.02%:  clearly this is a useful
0.02%:  I can tell this formula is over.
0.02%:  that was less of
0.02%:  clearly this formula is wrong at
0.02%:  now my advice formula is T
0.02%:  now I should really go
0.02%:  the formula only ever
0.02%:  I guess this must
0.02%:  I guess all my friends have
0.02%:  my new formula is over!
0.02%:  that one was good.
0.02%:  my formula is worse than ever
0.02%:  my last class is on
0.02%:  I guess this really is over!
0.02%:  now I really am tired of this.
0.02%:  this formula is slowly coming
0.02%:  so clearly this is a great
0.02%:  I admit it. My formula never
0.02%:  not sure if I
0.02%:  not sure if I should
0.02%:  so for nurses I really
0.02%:  so the formula rel
0.02%:  I confess that was
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula wins.
0.02%:  my last advice is for losers who
0.02%:  my last advice is for them all
0.02%:  no more calls for this
0.02%:  my last formula is this!
0.02%:  my friends. I have come
0.02%:  nurses! My advice formula is a
0.02%:  my formula is done! I will
0.02%:  the formula loses its novel
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is tired
0.02%:  her
0.02%:  I guess this formula is really a
0.02%:  this formula really does turn
0.02%:  this formula only gave
0.02%:  I guess that is really
0.02%:  I really could go
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses sort
0.02%:  this was your fault
0.02%:  clearly this last one does
0.02%:  nurses are a tough
0.35%:  nurses are a tough crowd.
0.03%:  nurses are a tough sell
0.03%:  nurses are a tough crowd. I
0.03%:  nurses are a tough sell!
0.02%:  nurses are a tough crowd for
0.02%:  nurses are a tough crowd! I
0.02%:  sorry for all the swear
0.02%:  I will use this formula more
0.02%:  I will grant this formula does
0.02%:  I can see that formula
0.02%:  this last one is way
0.02%:  and while
0.02%:  sounds fair
0.02%:  clearly this formula grows more sin
0.02%:  I swear to
0.02%:  this formula can really do
0.02%:  now my advice formula still
0.02%:  nurses was
0.02%:  clearly I have it figured
0.03%:  clearly I have it figured out.
0.03%:  clearly I have it figured out!
0.02%:  that one really is gross!
0.02%:  forget it. I have
0.02%:  forget it. I have clearly
0.03%:  forget it. I have clearly run
0.02%:  well the
0.10%:  well the formula
0.06%:  well the formula is
0.03%:  well the last
0.03%:  well the formula runs
0.03%:  well the formula runs dry
0.02%:  well the formula runs dry at
0.02%:  I still have some self
0.02%:  so the results can vary
0.02%:  my last advice for a long time.
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was trash
0.02%:  my formula is still sound!
0.02%:  this formula may sound clever
0.02%:  if that isn
0.02%:  so my last advice formula there isn
0.02%:  clearly it gets worse and
0.02%:  what colour
0.02%:  I guess my formula is valid.
0.02%:  this all gets
0.02%:  well I guess that means
0.02%:  this was really fun to come
0.02%:  my real last advice for
0.07%:  my real last advice for nurses
0.02%:  not every formula I
0.02%:  clearly this formula is good times
0.02%:  send
0.02%:  that advice formula is wrong
0.02%:  my new career starts
0.02%:  clearly this is over for us
0.02%:  clearly I have some strong
0.02%:  my final words to this class
0.02%:  my formula is less great
0.02%:  now clearly I must
0.02%:  now clearly I must have
0.02%:  now clearly I must have missed
0.02%:  that one is clearly awful so
0.02%:  I never said this was gr
0.02%:  clearly this was a T
0.02%:  I guess the formula is only sort
0.02%:  so clearly if nurses
0.02%:  this gets me
0.02%:  so I never said my formula was SPE
0.02%:  that was really grim. I
0.02%:  my friends. I must go
0.02%:  this got really weird real
0.02%:  I will never say this formula got
0.02%:  my new formula still has its
0.02%:  this formula gets real
0.02%:  I love nurses almost
0.02%:  well. I guess this formula is a
0.02%:  I guess this formula only covers real
0.02%:  my advice formula still has strong
0.02%:  my last word on this issue
0.02%:  my advice for all nurses who
0.02%:  the formula is clearly un
0.02%:  it was a really long drive
0.02%:  there is no formula
0.02%:  clearly this formula is our
0.02%:  my last hour of advice
0.02%:  frig I totally
0.02%:  so clearly the first version
0.02%:  so clearly the first version was
0.02%:  my last advice session!
0.02%:  forget my advice!
0.02%:  clearly this formula is using words
0.02%:  are we still doing
0.02%:  now my last advice is for all
0.02%:  not every formula was a
0.02%:  so I never claimed this formula was truly
0.02%:  what are nurses for
0.02%:  I guess so.
0.02%:  I guess that really could
0.02%:  whatever let
0.02%:  it gets harder for nurses!
0.02%:  I will give myself that
0.02%:  their last name
0.02%:  review
0.02%:  my last advice is for smug
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula was not
0.02%:  this formula really was custom
0.02%:  the formula is DE
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula is DE
0.02%:  so while I
0.02%:  I deserve a salary for this now
0.02%:  that was really rude!
0.02%:  forget it. I should never
0.02%:  if you call
0.02%:  if you call nurses
0.02%:  my real advice formula is to
0.02%:  so I guess this formula already
0.02%:  whatever. I can tell
0.02%:  so clearly that one is awful
0.02%:  my arms are tired. I
0.02%:  get
0.02%:  get your
0.17%:  get your own formula
0.07%:  get your own advice
1.04%:  get your own advice formula
0.44%:  get your own advice formula.
0.07%:  get your own formula.
0.05%:  get your own advice formula! I
0.05%:  get your own advice!
0.04%:  get your own advice formula. I
0.03%:  get your own advice form
0.02%:  my formula has gotten weird!
0.02%:  I guess my formula hits a sn
0.02%:  I guess this could finally
0.02%:  um. I should really
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is sound!
0.02%:  those are my last five
0.02%:  those are my last five dollars
0.02%:  my mouth is closed forever.
0.02%:  it loses its charm in
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is too literal
0.02%:  my last advice for real!
0.02%:  I guess this formula only writes
0.03%:  I guess this formula only writes advice
0.02%:  clearly I win at life
0.02%:  nurses with
0.02%:  those are really awful
0.02%:  I never said this formula was DEEP!
0.02%:  I found my
0.02%:  my last advice is from the nurses
0.02%:  whatever. I could go on all
0.02%:  good call
0.02%:  so not all advice was
0.02%:  for nurses I will give
0.02%:  for nurses I will give you that
0.02%:  allow me to clarify.
0.02%:  this formula seems to really
0.02%:  clearly I was missing
0.02%:  clearly I have to win
0.02%:  those were all for
0.02%:  my new advice formula IS less
0.02%:  so not really sure
0.02%:  now this advice formula really gets
0.02%:  my last advice answer is for
0.02%:  my last advice is for ME!
0.02%:  where are all my inv
0.02%:  that was unfair!
0.02%:  the formula only covers 
0.02%:  can we P
0.02%:  not all advice form
0.02%:  sounds right
0.02%:  those are awful
0.02%:  they are nurses.
0.02%:  sorry I was
0.02%:  my new advice formula uses
0.02%:  so I have clearly run out of ideas
0.02%:  this formula is scary.
0.02%:  this was my last idea
0.02%:  this was my last idea for
0.02%:  clearly I love words
0.02%:  clearly I have great
0.02%:  clearly this game is now over. I
0.02%:  so we could
0.02%:  that one was clearly less good.
0.02%:  really! I should
0.02%:  that one is clearly for lovers
0.02%:  turns out I really had
0.02%:  my formula is right and
0.02%:  confess!
0.02%:  I guess that advice only
0.02%:  clearly this formula IS more
0.02%:  yes. I will give
0.02%:  moving away from all
0.02%:  not every formula is class
0.02%:  guess I should start narrow
0.02%:  so this formula only ever results
0.02%:  I was sort of trying
0.02%:  all I have left in
0.02%:  so clearly nurses D
0.02%:  I guess my last formula is invalid
0.02%:  so my formula is still generic
0.02%:  sorry for the gross
0.02%:  I really must confess
0.02%:  it usually gets
0.36%:  it usually gets worse from
0.02%:  so my advice formula now
0.02%:  my formula still needs twe
0.02%:  I am clearly the worst nurse
0.02%:  yes! I guess
0.02%:  clearly this formula is never good.
0.02%:  clearly this is a forum
0.02%:  my last rule was
0.02%:  so clearly nurses would get
0.02%:  so my last advice still
0.02%:  my advice formula grows stale.
0.02%:  I will never use that form
0.02%:  I am totally having
0.02%:  clearly I should give it a rest for now
0.02%:  clearly I have a long
0.02%:  clearly this formula is not us
0.02%:  so my formula is invalid.
0.02%:  I guess that covers all your friends!
0.02%:  so my last advice formula there is
0.02%:  so u
0.02%:  this was clearly not a
0.02%:  forget I said all those
0.02%:  clearly this is a met
0.02%:  this all sounds way more racist
0.02%:  so sue
0.02%:  my last advice here for
0.02%:  so my advice is a
0.02%:  I guess the formula can really
0.02%:  I still have more left
0.02%:  my formula is showing clear
0.02%:  well I guess my advice formula has sort
0.02%:  whatever man! I could
0.02%:  listen! My advice formula has got
0.02%:  so really this formula covers
0.02%:  so my formula is less than clever
0.02%:  I really have to run!
0.02%:  so clearly a nurse would rather
0.02%:  so clearly I should narrow
0.02%:  nurses are a little hard for
0.02%:  sarcasm is totally
0.02%:  that one was really cruel
0.02%:  over here
0.02%:  so my formula leads
0.02%:  so my last advice formula in this
0.02%:  my last advice is free! I will
0.02%:  clearly I must never
0.02%:  listen. I love
0.02%:  so my formula covers all the nurses!
0.02%:  this is already
0.02%:  clearly this formula needs two
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice has its
0.02%:  I could use this for
0.02%:  after all these
0.02%:  my advice formula is a little gross.
0.02%:  I must have used all
0.02%:  now this is clearly a
0.02%:  I agree.
0.02%:  those were all l
0.02%:  my advice formula is not so great!
0.02%:  my last class is in five
0.02%:  so clearly this is more of
0.02%:  my formula sounds great!
0.02%:  my last advice is for sl
0.02%:  why am I still doing
0.02%:  so nurses will love this
0.02%:  what if I say nurses are
0.02%:  that was less useful.
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is genius. I
0.02%:  so I should really focus
0.02%:  this got less
0.02%:  now this formula is cre
0.02%:  I guess this is my final
0.02%:  so it gets really
0.02%:  this formula really IS coming
0.02%:  my formula got weird all
0.02%:  clearly this formula is given
0.02%:  so that one is awful
0.02%:  that one is really weird. I
0.02%:  I guess we found
0.02%:  my last advice is for nurses who are ST
0.02%:  if I ever hear
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets more sad
0.02%:  well. I guess this formula is not
0.02%:  so I wouldn
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is not well
0.02%:  clearly I should not write for
0.02%:  my formula is harder
0.02%:  not really the
0.02%:  this formula is losing lust
0.02%:  forget nurses! My last words
0.02%:  forget nurses! My last words are
0.02%:  this formula is really good! I want
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of words right
0.02%:  so clearly I should write it
0.02%:  my advice formula is ruling
0.02%:  it sounds really cr
0.02%:  that was ugly!
0.02%:  I am really glad this
0.04%:  I am really glad this is over now
0.03%:  I am really glad this is over!
0.03%:  I am really glad this is over now!
0.02%:  clearly there is an
0.02%:  this formula could only get
0.02%:  so I clearly have some limits!
0.02%:  my last ditch
0.02%:  so I guess this really could
0.02%:  well then!
0.02%:  since you
0.02%:  listen! My formula is vers
0.02%:  I came
0.02%:  so I guess that advice formula is more
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is a little weird.
0.02%:  that one really D
0.02%:  so the results vary.
0.02%:  my advice formula is written!
0.02%:  I guess that reminds
0.02%:  my last one should
0.03%:  my last one should cover
0.02%:  I gave myself nurses
0.02%:  clearly this formula is drawing some
0.02%:  so my advice formula is IMP
0.02%:  I may need
0.02%:  guess it
0.02%:  I will never say that formula is
0.02%:  I guess all those
0.02%:  my friends are right!
0.02%:  this is a good formula
0.02%:  clearly it gets hard
0.02%:  I ran out of silly words there!
0.02%:  so clearly this is over now
0.02%:  forget it all
0.02%:  this was really useful
0.02%:  I guess my formula can still have its
0.02%:  if you give
0.02%:  so my formula has errors
0.02%:  since I
0.02%:  clearly this formula is and
0.02%:  if I was
0.02%:  now for my
0.02%:  for this last one I will
0.02%:  this could get really fun
0.02%:  this is all I want
0.02%:  I guess nurses had
0.02%:  forget it. I should really
0.02%:  one last time
0.02%:  one last time!
0.02%:  my last advice for writing
0.02%:  I really should give it
0.04%:  I really should give it a rest now!
0.04%:  I really should give it a rest.
0.02%:  I really should give it a rest!
0.02%:  forget this. I will never discuss
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly uns
0.02%:  I have not
0.02%:  I have used all
0.02%:  this last one was from my regular
0.02%:  clearly I am having some issues.
0.02%:  granted!
0.02%:  is this over
0.02%:  sorry I got
0.03%:  sorry I got carried
0.02%:  clearly this formula does more
0.02%:  this was all my friends
0.02%:  so I guess the world
0.02%:  so my formula got
0.02%:  my advice for nurses was a little sour
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over! I guess
0.02%:  clearly I must have a
0.02%:  it sounds awful there
0.02%:  this almost
0.02%:  whatever. I usually
0.02%:  my good
0.02%:  not all of them are g
0.02%:  I admit it! My formula grows less
0.02%:  for nurses I totally
0.02%:  so I never said they
0.02%:  screw your
0.02%:  this formula runs dry over time
0.02%:  now this formula is clearly DE
0.02%:  I guess if you have
0.02%:  clearly this last one I
0.02%:  whoever said my formula is l
0.02%:  I guess my formula is done!
0.02%:  the first one was really good!
0.02%:  that one is also really
0.02%:  this formula only lets me advise
0.02%:  this new formula I
0.02%:  I guess the advice isn
0.02%:  that one is ugly
0.02%:  this last one really does
0.02%:  my formula IS a little screw
0.02%:  my last advice is for other
0.02%:  this formula can still do
0.02%:  that one is clearly D
0.02%:  clearly this last one was for
0.02%:  I guess my last formula has
0.02%:  so my formula gives us
0.02%:  forget nurses. My last word is
0.02%:  that one really is worse
0.02%:  the formula only sort
0.02%:  I guess this is all over
0.02%:  my last advice is for me. I
0.02%:  my last advice is for me. I will
0.02%:  time for lunch! I
0.02%:  I must have missed a few
0.02%:  alright! My formula covers
0.02%:  alright! My formula covers nurses
0.02%:  so this formula will get
0.02%:  clearly this formula is master
0.02%:  I really want to give
0.02%:  my last class is leaving
0.02%:  so I was having
0.02%:  I should really use
0.02%:  I guess this formula really can do
0.02%:  I should start my
0.02%:  that was gross! I never
0.02%:  this formula is really moving
0.02%:  this formula is really moving towards
0.02%:  the last is
0.02%:  this formula is down
0.02%:  I guess this formula is very narrow.
0.02%:  well guess
0.02%:  listen. I have really
0.02%:  I guess this is not really
0.02%:  well! I guess that covers a
0.02%:  this formula is clearly great! I wonder
0.02%:  I have nurses figured
0.02%:  this new advice formula rule
0.02%:  whoever said my form
0.02%:  enough! I clearly
0.02%:  I can see how my formula is sort
0.02%:  will you admit
0.02%:  this is called
0.02%:  this new advice formula is all sorts
0.02%:  well they
0.02%:  I am sorry nurses
0.02%:  so clearly the answer to
0.02%:  whatever! I figured
0.02%:  listen. My formula has a
0.02%:  this is clearly out
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is driving
0.02%:  my new formula is all
0.02%:  this is last call for nur
0.02%:  now you must
0.02%:  so clearly I was over
0.02%:  so my advice formula is when
0.02%:  my lesson is over! I
0.02%:  I never said my formula was ill
0.02%:  I guess the world
0.02%:  my last ones are all
0.02%:  shoot me.
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses was a little gr
0.02%:  so clearly the formula is not as
0.05%:  so clearly the formula is not as vers
0.02%:  I guess this advice is all
0.02%:  that one was clearly self
0.02%:  so clearly these last
0.02%:  so this formula clearly sounds
0.02%:  so this formula clearly sounds great
0.02%:  hold on a sec!
0.02%:  this game is over! I clearly win.
0.02%:  that is gross and I will
0.02%:  this formula is solid
0.02%:  this formula is solid!
0.02%:  clearly this is over for me now
0.02%:  I only have a limited
0.02%:  I only came
0.02%:  my advice to nurses is flaw
0.02%:  that sounds really o
0.02%:  so my advice formula is as
0.02%:  so clearly I have a few
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula still has one
0.02%:  is that all your
0.02%:  this new advice formula is so great!
0.02%:  I guess not all of
0.02%:  now I admit
0.02%:  this is great. I love my
0.12%:  this is great. I love my formula
0.02%:  this is great. I love my formula and
0.02%:  I would say that is
0.02%:  I guess my advice formula is a little DE
0.02%:  so clearly the formula DE
0.02%:  clearly I have it figured out now
0.02%:  no more! My formula has served us
0.02%:  my last advice formula sort
0.02%:  those last few may
0.02%:  so clearly it turns
0.02%:  show over
0.02%:  so clearly I wrote
0.02%:  my advice for nurses goes
0.02%:  my final words to the class!
0.02%:  not all advice is this useful.
0.02%:  this formula really is genius
0.02%:  this formula really is genius!
0.02%:  screw you too!
0.02%:  now that I really
0.02%:  my last words to nurses
0.02%:  you win! I could
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly DE
0.02%:  my heart is racing so
0.02%:  nurses. I guess
0.02%:  so it still has
0.02%:  so I was never really that
0.02%:  my new advice formula has sort
0.02%:  so we have nurses
0.02%:  this will never go
0.02%:  my last advice for all nurses E
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is all
0.02%:  so the moral
0.02%:  I have learned from
0.02%:  so I guess all my advice formula
0.02%:  clearly this is a gold mine. I
0.02%:  I must admit.
0.02%:  this formula is clearly w
0.02%:  my last advice formula is worth using
0.02%:  I love this formula and so
0.02%:  the rest of my advice is all
0.02%:  my advice is no
0.02%:  so I guess you win!
0.02%:  the formula was less
0.02%:  so all that
0.02%:  I guess this advice was
0.02%:  so I still can
0.02%:  I guess this clearly
0.02%:  my last advice is for mortals.
0.02%:  nurses are a tough crowd to
0.02%:  no regrets over my
0.02%:  my last rule for nurses
0.02%:  that was D
0.02%:  this formula is really gross.
0.02%:  so there.
0.02%:  this is really gross.
0.02%:  this formula is good.
0.02%:  I could use a
0.02%:  I will use this advice from
0.02%:  I guess this is fun
0.02%:  clearly this formula is swe
0.02%:  this answer
0.02%:  clearly this is good for
0.02%:  so my formula has all
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly great.
0.02%:  not great advice.
0.02%:  that was in
0.02%:  I win this game
0.02%:  my advice formula is trash.
0.02%:  clearly this was a M
0.02%:  the formula is clearly now
0.02%:  clearly I should write some songs!
0.02%:  I guess my last advice follows
0.02%:  I love this formula! My last
0.02%:  I guess my new formula is sort
0.02%:  that was really gross so never
0.02%:  that sounds more grim
0.02%:  so clearly this format doesn
0.02%:  I guess this formula is a lot
0.02%:  clearly I have a lot more writing
0.02%:  my last real formula
0.02%:  well! I guess my last
0.05%:  well! I guess my last advice
0.04%:  well! I guess my last advice is for
0.02%:  well! I guess my last advice for
0.02%:  I guess the formula D
0.02%:  this got way more
0.02%:  frig. I should really
0.02%:  so you caught me.
0.02%:  not all advice is so useful
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula ST
0.02%:  I guess the formula is over now
0.02%:  alright! I will
0.02%:  the formula is still good.
0.02%:  the words
0.02%:  my advice formula has let
0.02%:  my last class was more fun.
0.02%:  listen. My formula covers 
0.02%:  as much as I love telling
0.02%:  I really wish nurses could
0.02%:  I sound
0.02%:  this really is a formula
0.02%:  I really need to go
0.02%:  that sound
0.02%:  clearly this was less
0.02%:  my full
0.02%:  this got really weird for
0.02%:  this formula is so clever
0.02%:  I never claimed this was moral
0.02%:  my last one is for whatever
0.02%:  with my
0.02%:  with my last
0.02%:  you win. I could
0.02%:  all the nurses left
0.02%:  I guess that reminds us
0.02%:  I guess that reminds us all
0.02%:  this really is a formula!
0.02%:  whatever! I tried
0.02%:  I can sort
0.02%:  nurses are all screw
0.02%:  I guess that will
0.02%:  so this formula is clearly wrong
0.02%:  so my last advice is for the
0.02%:  clearly this is good for nurses
0.02%:  that one is valid.
0.02%:  last one will
0.02%:  actual nurses will agree this
0.02%:  I never said this formula came
0.02%:  my friend has some
0.02%:  this formula really is good! I
0.02%:  so my formula covers nurses well
0.02%:  my new formula is still great.
0.02%:  so much for nurses. I really
0.02%:  so nurses are really hard
0.02%:  does that answer
0.02%:  I clearly have to write
0.02%:  so nurses should all commit
0.02%:  so the formula is really strong.
0.02%:  well! I guess my formula is a
0.02%:  this formula is now my secret.
0.02%:  I will never use this for good
0.02%:  give me a minute.
0.02%:  my last advice formula while
0.02%:  give it
0.02%:  that one really came
0.02%:  th
0.02%:  so the formula is not
0.02%:  so the formula is not really
0.02%:  so the formula is not always
0.02%:  this last one is all
0.02%:  they were all animals
0.02%:  my last words aren
0.02%:  this is our last call!
0.02%:  my master
0.02%:  well. I guess my advice for
0.02%:  this is all very nice
0.02%:  so I admit my
0.02%:  that one is less clear. I
0.02%:  clearly I love nurses too
0.02%:  using that formula is really
0.02%:  screw this I
0.02%:  this advice was mostly
0.02%:  I will never use my formula as
0.02%:  so my new advice formula rules.
0.02%:  that one fails
0.02%:  so the formula is clear!
0.02%:  I had nurses
0.02%:  so clearly this formula ensures
0.02%:  that second
0.02%:  my secret formula was right in
0.02%:  we really should focus
0.02%:  I should cut
0.04%:  I should cut myself
0.02%:  turns out I really was
0.02%:  clearly what I said
0.02%:  well my advice formula is great
0.02%:  clearly I must have missed an
0.02%:  my last advice was T
0.02%:  this formula gets worse over
0.02%:  so our
0.02%:  this anal
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula is now
0.02%:  so I guess my advice forum
0.02%:  I guess we really
0.03%:  I guess we really should
0.02%:  I have a million more.
0.02%:  nurses have it really good
0.02%:  I might need some
0.02%:  last guess
0.02%:  so clearly this new formula is a sm
0.02%:  clearly this formula is must
0.02%:  my last idea for nurses was more
0.02%:  my advice formula still is
0.02%:  my last one was sort
0.02%:  my other advice formula is also
0.02%:  my last words have got
0.02%:  whatever! I found
0.02%:  that one is really gross. I would
0.02%:  as much as I love you
0.02%:  woah.
0.02%:  I forgot nurses should
0.02%:  my friend! I have got
0.02%:  whatever is
0.02%:  I only have two
0.02%:  unless the
0.02%:  now for my last
0.02%:  finally! I give
0.02%:  so clearly nurses should form
0.02%:  not all of my advice is great! I
0.02%:  so not all my form
0.02%:  forget nurses! My advice was
0.02%:  I really should start serving
0.02%:  I guess my formula holds water
0.02%:  this is all I want from
0.02%:  I swear this formula isn
0.02%:  I will leave that
0.02%:  it gets really hard now!
0.02%:  this formula is awesome. I could
0.02%:  my new career has
0.02%:  d
0.02%:  sorry to cut
0.02%:  this was my last favour
0.02%:  I guess this advice really is
0.02%:  dammit.
0.02%:  that is a really good
0.02%:  the last one was ugly
0.02%:  I was trying for clever
0.02%:  this one was a
0.02%:  I still have my
0.02%:  so my advice formula is losing
0.02%:  well I guess my formula is not
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets rad
0.02%:  wait a second. I
0.02%:  that is some
0.02%:  my final word goes
0.02%:  clearly I ran out of steam!
0.02%:  I guess my last advice formula in
0.02%:  my formula is clever and
0.02%:  so much for nurses today.
0.02%:  no I really
0.02%:  not all my advice is this useful.
0.02%:  that one is way less good.
0.02%:  so nurses have some
0.02%:  my last one for real.
0.02%:  now I regret
0.02%:  now I regret this
0.02%:  enough of my
0.02%:  enough of my advice
0.02%:  enough of my advice.
0.02%:  so clearly this is great!
0.02%:  a lot of nurses have
0.02%:  I guess some advice turns
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is r
0.02%:  my reward for this is a
0.02%:  so I really should get
0.02%:  my last advice formula is MET
0.02%:  I ran out of clever words right
0.02%:  I guess this advice wasn
0.02%:  so my formula does run
0.02%:  as much as I love saying
0.02%:  my last advice is from a nurse
0.02%:  now I regret all
0.03%:  now I regret all this
0.03%:  now I regret all this advice
0.02%:  I guess this formula lets
0.02%:  I lost focus
0.02%:  I love this formula system.
0.02%:  so the formula is clearly sound
0.02%:  I really should start fig
0.02%:  when it
0.02%:  nurses is a tough
0.02%:  nurses is a tough crowd
0.02%:  I guess this reminds
0.02%:  clearly I should go start
0.02%:  yes! I will admit this
0.10%:  yes! I will admit this formula
0.02%:  yes! I will admit this formula can
0.02%:  clearly this formula gets S
0.02%:  I guess this formula covers any
0.02%:  this formula is great. I will never say
0.02%:  clearly we have our
0.02%:  no more clever
0.02%:  so my last advice is for writers
0.02%:  clearly this formula is so damn vers
0.02%:  so you get
0.02%:  I guess it all
0.03%:  I guess it all sounds
0.02%:  five
0.18%:  five dollars
0.03%:  five minutes
0.02%:  I should write myself
0.02%:  this last one is clearly worse.
0.02%:  clearly the formula is missing a word or
0.02%:  that sounds gross. I really
0.02%:  clearly I must have more
0.02%:  my formula is valid across the
0.02%:  my latest
0.02%:  no more. I have
0.02%:  their life
0.03%:  their life sounds
0.02%:  their life sounds really
0.02%:  they nurses
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is out
0.02%:  I gave myself credit
0.02%:  clearly this is useful and
0.02%:  this last one is worse
0.02%:  guys. I have
0.02%:  I ran out of ways
0.02%:  my advice formula went
0.02%:  I lost the
0.02%:  so I guess with
0.02%:  clearly this formula is I
0.02%:  that usually
0.02%:  never call me for last words
0.02%:  so this formula sort
0.02%:  so the formula IS limited
0.02%:  so I really should never
0.02%:  that was cor
0.02%:  so I guess it really doesn
0.02%:  so clearly this is a formula I must
0.02%:  my formula gets cor
0.02%:  I guess their
0.02%:  I guess this new advice formula sort
0.02%:  those sound less
0.02%:  fine! I admit
0.02%:  so I guess this wouldn
0.02%:  frig. I really
0.03%:  frig. I really should
0.02%:  my last advice is for us right
0.05%:  my last advice is for us right now!
0.02%:  so it all
0.04%:  so it all sounds
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is still sort
0.02%:  so nurses are all screw
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is rad!
0.02%:  my advice formula has its uses
0.02%:  so my advice formula has errors.
0.02%:  rarely do
0.02%:  my advice formula is SE
0.02%:  clearly this formula is over and we must
0.02%:  so I guess my failure
0.02%:  my advice formula was the
0.02%:  their lives are awful.
0.02%:  that one is over
0.02%:  it fails
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses also
0.02%:  I guess my last advice to
0.02%:  my follow
0.02%:  my formula is strong!
0.02%:  so I guess my version
0.02%:  yeah I guess it falls
0.02%:  I swear this formula doesn
0.02%:  so I will never forget this
0.02%:  so my formula will need
0.02%:  I guess this was a failure.
0.02%:  those last few ones
0.02%:  frig I can
0.02%:  so clearly this formula is a genius!
0.02%:  so clearly this anal
0.02%:  clearly this formula grows tired. I
0.02%:  clearly this formula is so wrong
0.02%:  I guess nurses have totally
0.02%:  that one comes
0.02%:  that one comes from real
0.02%:  my lunch is
0.03%:  my lunch is over
0.02%:  it sounds really great
0.02%:  I never said this formula was close
0.02%:  clearly this game is for adults
0.02%:  so my new advice formula is still great!
0.02%:  I guess this would all
0.02%:  clearly I am the most useful
0.02%:  nurses had
0.02%:  I will never use that formula!
0.02%:  my last advise will
0.02%:  now you should start
0.02%:  my last laugh of
0.02%:  my last formula was reverse
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses is great
0.02%:  clearly I love the
0.02%:  clearly this formula sounds great!
0.02%:  using this formula as
0.02%:  so I guess the formula covers
0.03%:  so I guess the formula covers all
0.02%:  so clearly this formula needs M
0.02%:  not all the advice formula
0.02%:  from what I can
0.02%:  I was sort of lying
0.02%:  that was more fun
0.02%:  this clearly needs a
0.02%:  my last answer is a
0.02%:  my advice formula wins.
0.02%:  so my advice formula DE
0.02%:  my formula also has
0.02%:  so I was never really cut
0.02%:  class is over for the
0.02%:  class is over for the day.
0.02%:  this formula is do
0.02%:  I really should give it a rest for
0.02%:  my last dime for this
0.02%:  I still have issues
0.02%:  you lose
0.02%:  now my advice formula is a
0.02%:  this formula is way more racist
0.02%:  most of my nurses
0.02%:  so my advice has its flaws.
0.02%:  so your last
0.02%:  my advice formula is not a
0.02%:  so either
0.02%:  clearly this formula is moving towards S
0.02%:  so I have my
0.05%:  so I have my formula
0.03%:  so I have my formula down
0.02%:  now this formula is clearly more
0.02%:  so the formula is less magical
0.02%:  now are
0.02%:  so mostly this formula reveals
0.02%:  while I can
0.02%:  so most nurses will have
0.02%:  so most nurses will have already
0.02%:  I am calling
0.04%:  I am calling this
0.02%:  I am calling this formula
0.02%:  I am writing
0.03%:  I am writing this formula
0.02%:  I have a friend
0.02%:  so this was really fun.
0.02%:  so nurses have weird
0.02%:  it got worse.
0.02%:  I really have to run.
0.02%:  this is even worse
0.02%:  my time is over
0.02%:  my last advice formula sure
0.02%:  this is really great. I love
0.02%:  so nurses are always right
0.02%:  it loses its charm now
0.02%:  now my formula is less
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is legit
0.02%:  now I give
0.02%:  my last advice forum will
0.02%:  the formula is very strong
0.02%:  that was clearly from
0.02%:  clearly the formula is ver
0.02%:  my advice for nurses has a lot
0.02%:  so I guess this could really
0.02%:  so the formula is great and
0.02%:  so I che
0.02%:  whatever. I figured
0.02%:  so from
0.02%:  so my advice formula results in a
0.02%:  that one was self
0.02%:  so this formula IS clearly
0.02%:  so my formula is racist towards
0.02%:  forget nurses! My advice has
0.02%:  I never said it was gr
0.02%:  so my last failure might
0.02%:  forget this. I really
0.02%:  I guess nurses may
0.02%:  the formula is valid only
0.02%:  I lost my nerve
0.02%:  this formula is awesome! I love
0.02%:  I am clearly done
0.03%:  I am clearly done with
0.02%:  guess what my formula is called.
0.02%:  if you must
0.02%:  you need
0.02%:  my last word on this for
0.02%:  so this formula was really more
0.02%:  my new advice is that
0.02%:  so much for me
0.02%:  my formula is having a
0.02%:  my last round was more
0.02%:  my last advice sem
0.02%:  they get
0.02%:  clearly this formula is good times!
0.02%:  so I guess my formula is valid.
0.02%:  my advice formula still wins!
0.02%:  this formula is clearly as good
0.02%:  I can see my
0.06%:  I can see my formula
0.03%:  I can see my formula is
0.02%:  I can see my formula has
0.02%:  I can see my formula has its
0.02%:  very well.
0.02%:  yes. I will have to admit
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is golden.
0.02%:  well I guess my advice formula is not so
0.02%:  where do I
0.02%:  this formula is really smart!
0.02%:  smart guys
0.02%:  my new advice formula is all right
0.02%:  my last resort will
0.02%:  so this IS
0.02%:  I guess this really wouldn
0.02%:  the last one was really mor
0.02%:  so my last advice formula rule
0.02%:  I guess my formula started
0.02%:  well! I guess my advice formula hits
0.02%:  I clearly have run out of words!
0.02%:  frig that sounds worse
0.02%:  I guess my formula covers this
0.02%:  frig I really
0.02%:  frig I really should
0.02%:  this formula was clearly good
0.02%:  clearly this is moving towards self
0.02%:  that one was overly grim
0.02%:  alright! My formula isn
0.02%:  I ran out of advice
0.02%:  so clearly this formula grew
0.02%:  I never said all of this
0.02%:  well! My advice formula might
0.02%:  frig. I can
0.02%:  this is a great formula! I love
0.02%:  I guess this formula sorta
0.02%:  my new advice formula has to
0.02%:  long story short I will
0.02%:  chill!
0.02%:  so I was mostly
0.02%:  we should really cut
0.02%:  guess I should write
0.02%:  so my advice formula is also
0.02%:  I guess this formula means
0.02%:  I swear this formula only gives
0.02%:  this gets worse
0.02%:  whatever. I could go all
0.02%:  I am really tired
0.02%:  I am really tired now!
0.02%:  nurses! My advice formula is that
0.02%:  my last advice is worth all
0.02%:  DIS
0.02%:  this formula is overly
0.02%:  my last formula I
0.02%:  well the formula doesn
0.02%:  it gets less clear
0.02%:  nuclear miss
0.02%:  so clearly I win at this
0.02%:  my arms are tired now. I
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is mor
0.02%:  this is great. I love nurses
0.02%:  so I guess this advice formula may
0.02%:  so all these
0.02%:  I really should start over from
0.02%:  forget this! I can
0.02%:  so clearly this is an awful
0.02%:  almost all nurses are fired
0.02%:  that one is way less useful!
0.02%:  my last advice is for nurses I
0.02%:  I guess that sounds more
0.02%:  so clearly I win at this game!
0.02%:  I guess their lives
0.02%:  so this is mostly
0.02%:  when are
0.02%:  my last words are for lovers
0.02%:  my last dollar is worth more
0.01%:  it was less
0.01%:  I guess my last advice formula is in
0.01%:  the formula is so vers
0.01%:  so I clearly have issues!
0.01%:  sorry for the last answer.
0.01%:  nursery schools would
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not reward
0.01%:  watch me
0.01%:  can we all agree my
0.01%:  clearly I have issues and
0.01%:  so I was right!
0.01%:  so this is my new formula!
0.01%:  forget all those
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula was
0.01%:  I will never do this formula
0.01%:  so nurses are scary.
0.01%:  forget nurses. My advice will
0.01%:  I will never forget this class.
0.01%:  enough! My advice formula is DE
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was M
0.01%:  my new advice formula rule
0.02%:  my new advice formula rule is that
0.01%:  my last advice is for gam
0.05%:  my last advice is for gamers!
0.01%:  so I ran out of clever
0.02%:  so I ran out of clever ways
0.01%:  frig that sounds way
0.01%:  now this formula seems really racist
0.01%:  I love this format
0.01%:  I start
0.01%:  it sounds really awful right
0.01%:  I am clearly using this formula to derive
0.01%:  the formula is clearly at
0.01%:  my formula does start
0.01%:  this is my last clever
0.01%:  my advice has grown
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula sort
0.01%:  clearly M
0.01%:  it may sound
0.01%:  this is my last nurse advice
0.01%:  yes. I have to
0.01%:  this was for
0.02%:  this was for real
0.01%:  my last dollar for this service
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives me too
0.01%:  well! I guess that covers your
0.01%:  this formula really does cover a
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ro
0.01%:  so in summary I guess what
0.01%:  good news
0.01%:  my last advice is for us all!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly run
0.01%:  this formula is great. I really
0.01%:  my advice formula grows stale!
0.01%:  this is clearly a long
0.01%:  yeah! I can
0.01%:  so clearly it gets harder as
0.01%:  this is clearly a more
0.01%:  I guess if this
0.01%:  I guess nurses have all
0.01%:  this formula is clearly strong.
0.01%:  screw this. I am never
0.01%:  I am clearly writing
0.01%:  so this is my last advice formula! I
0.01%:  my last formula stands
0.01%:  the last one is scary
0.01%:  my last advice rule is for mothers
0.01%:  I guess nurses have my
0.01%:  I have really run out of ideas.
0.01%:  I guess that advice wasn
0.01%:  that is awful. I
0.01%:  so my advice formula still wasn
0.01%:  so I guess that advice is only
0.03%:  so I guess that advice is only for
0.01%:  I will see
0.06%:  I will see myself
0.08%:  I will see myself out.
0.06%:  I will see myself out!
0.01%:  that was lous
0.02%:  that was lousy advice
0.01%:  this col
0.01%:  now I regret this formula
0.01%:  so I should really start using
0.01%:  clearly this formula is moving out
0.01%:  it was never really
0.01%:  we should really start over from
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula DE
0.01%:  I guess this leaves
0.01%:  that one was from real
0.01%:  clearly this formula is me
0.01%:  this formula is great! My
0.01%:  listen I have
0.01%:  guess what my last
0.02%:  guess what my last advice
0.03%:  guess what my last advice is for
0.01%:  my last advice is for me! I
0.03%:  my last advice is for me! I will
0.01%:  this formula is really sort
0.01%:  those are all ver
0.01%:  this advice is only
0.02%:  this advice is only useful
0.01%:  it was hard.
0.01%:  I guess this ends my
0.01%:  so clearly this formula saves me writing
0.01%:  we should really start over.
0.01%:  whoever said nurses is
0.01%:  this is my last one. I swear
0.01%:  you win. I guess this advice
0.01%:  that sounds way more gross
0.01%:  clearly I should forget nurses
0.01%:  do nurses really get
0.01%:  this is silly
0.01%:  I really n
0.01%:  my last advice forms are
0.01%:  so my formula screw
0.01%:  my last advice is when
0.01%:  what IS
0.02%:  what IS your
0.01%:  my last five dollars goes
0.01%:  clearly I should write for gre
0.01%:  that one is all yours.
0.01%:  this formula got old
0.01%:  clearly this formula is madness
0.01%:  um. I can
0.01%:  good answer
0.01%:  this formula is now my secret!
0.01%:  I can still hear myself over
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was mor
0.01%:  it loses its charm very
0.01%:  I have run out of silly
0.02%:  I have run out of silly words
0.01%:  the formula can get
0.01%:  so if you want
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula has no
0.01%:  so really this formula needs
0.01%:  nurses. I really
0.01%:  my new formula is a little gross
0.01%:  my last formula covers the
0.01%:  my formula is great and I will use
0.01%:  this formula is great. I would
0.02%:  this formula is great. I would marry
0.01%:  well my advice for nurses might
0.01%:  clearly even
0.01%:  I still have my regular
0.01%:  my last one is more
0.01%:  this formula is clearly tired
0.01%:  I guess it only covers
0.01%:  well I gotta
0.01%:  that is awful and
0.01%:  that was silly. I
0.01%:  my formula is over now. I
0.01%:  listen! My formula is so
0.01%:  I should listen to myself more!
0.01%:  my last advice for this one
0.01%:  so final
0.01%:  that covers
0.01%:  this new formula is T
0.01%:  this one IS really
0.01%:  now I feel sorry
0.01%:  well good
0.01%:  this is my last miracle for
0.01%:  that one is fully
0.01%:  I have no clue
0.01%:  nurses give
0.01%:  this formula is mostly a
0.01%:  clearly this formula is sorted!
0.01%:  wait this
0.01%:  forget this! I will never say
0.01%:  this formula is endless
0.01%:  later.
0.01%:  this one is really awful!
0.01%:  whatever. My friend
0.01%:  this all went
0.01%:  last nurse
0.01%:  you win. I have to
0.01%:  no more fav
0.02%:  no more favours.
0.01%:  I love this formula and we
0.01%:  if this isn
0.01%:  listen. My formula does have
0.01%:  I never said my form was
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses with regular
0.01%:  nurses! I really should
0.01%:  I have so
0.02%:  I have so many more!
0.01%:  my advice is a
0.01%:  my new advice rules
0.01%:  this formula is great! I would marry
0.01%:  the formula is only sort
0.01%:  my latest advice
0.16%:  my latest advice formula
0.05%:  my latest advice formula isn
0.03%:  my latest advice formula is less
0.01%:  this is really great! I could
0.01%:  so the formula gets old
0.01%:  so I really have no
0.01%:  this formula clearly is never
0.01%:  my col
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is not used
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is now DE
0.01%:  fine. My advice
0.01%:  so I have clearly figured
0.01%:  my advice formula is str
0.01%:  my formula is not as clever as I would
0.01%:  well I guess that covers us
0.01%:  I love my own
0.01%:  mostly true
0.01%:  so all my advice has
0.01%:  so my new career as
0.01%:  I really should win
0.01%:  the formula is very literal
0.02%:  the formula is very literal and
0.01%:  second last
0.01%:  this formula is clearly st
0.01%:  still waiting
0.06%:  still waiting for my
0.02%:  still waiting for your
0.02%:  still waiting for my che
0.01%:  I guess they all
0.01%:  I guess they all sound
0.01%:  this is really useful
0.01%:  my last advice slot has
0.01%:  my last minute
0.01%:  not all of my advice results
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more nu
0.01%:  this formula sounds really great.
0.01%:  my advice formula was stolen!
0.01%:  my formula has one draw
0.01%:  so I guess for
0.01%:  that one is clearly murder
0.01%:  I should never try
0.01%:  frig! I should
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets more sar
0.01%:  that was self
0.01%:  my advice formula is all wrong
0.01%:  so the formula clearly gives
0.01%:  using this formula I will create
0.01%:  forget nurses. I could
0.01%:  nurses! I have to
0.01%:  my last formula is serious
0.01%:  this is over for
0.01%:  my new formula is a little harder
0.01%:  I seem to have lost my focus
0.01%:  clearly this is not a real
0.01%:  I only have four more credits
0.01%:  listen! I should
0.01%:  turns out my advice IS
0.01%:  sorry. I don
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is great on
0.01%:  clearly this formula was do
0.01%:  so clearly I should run
0.01%:  half
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more varied
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wrong!
0.01%:  so this new
0.17%:  so this new formula
0.09%:  so this new formula is clearly
0.03%:  so this new formula is really
0.03%:  so this new formula clearly
0.02%:  so this new formula still
0.02%:  so this new formula is called
0.02%:  so this new formula really
0.02%:  so this new advice
0.08%:  so this new advice formula is really
0.06%:  so this new advice formula really
0.05%:  so this new advice formula still
0.03%:  so this new advice formula is great
0.02%:  so this new advice formula IS
0.02%:  so this new advice formula is great!
0.02%:  so this new advice formula may
0.02%:  so this new formula is really great
0.02%:  so this new advice formula is mostly
0.01%:  the formula gets silly
0.01%:  my last formula would have
0.01%:  so I guess this will only ever
0.01%:  I may have ran
0.01%:  now this advice formula is T
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is a little over
0.01%:  I clearly have nurses
0.01%:  this formula is great! I am
0.01%:  yeah it sounds gross
0.01%:  I declare this formula to
0.01%:  you win! I love
0.01%:  so I guess it could
0.01%:  this was my most
0.01%:  using this formula I already
0.01%:  so every nurse
0.01%:  for nurses this advice will
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is worth
0.01%:  now my advice formula is this
0.01%:  clearly this formula is n
0.01%:  so clearly the more
0.01%:  guess what my last formula
0.02%:  guess what my last formula is!
0.01%:  I will give them credit
0.01%:  my advice has all
0.03%:  my advice has all sorts
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was ST
0.01%:  screw you for having
0.01%:  my shift is almost over. I will
0.01%:  a lot of this
0.03%:  a lot of this advice
0.01%:  my formula is great and I love it.
0.01%:  so my last advice formula rel
0.01%:  so clearly I have it
0.01%:  not all my advice was so
0.01%:  my formula has lost its edge
0.01%:  well I have some
0.01%:  my last credit for
0.01%:  this one is clearly false.
0.01%:  I still have friends
0.01%:  so don
0.01%:  give me a second. I
0.01%:  will that do
0.01%:  that is gross. I
0.01%:  I guess there was
0.01%:  this really is great advice
0.01%:  I swear this is my last nur
0.01%:  my advice formula has lost its genius!
0.01%:  I guess this formula was really not
0.01%:  that was very mor
0.01%:  clearly we should give our
0.01%:  new rule for this game
0.01%:  so clearly this never would
0.01%:  so for nurses that
0.01%:  so clearly nurses do a
0.01%:  with regards
0.01%:  my voice hurts now from
0.02%:  my voice hurts now from all
0.01%:  so if I ever
0.01%:  clearly this game is over and I lost
0.01%:  this is all my friends
0.01%:  there I ran out of words!
0.01%:  this formula is still very good
0.01%:  this formula is really random
0.01%:  I was saving
0.02%:  I was saving this
0.03%:  I was saving this for
0.07%:  I was saving this for later
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula is not so
0.01%:  can we still
0.01%:  not every formula is a sl
0.01%:  my final advice is D
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a lie
0.01%:  their life must
0.01%:  so last night I dream
0.01%:  can we start over
0.01%:  I leave this
0.02%:  I leave this formula
0.01%:  so my new formula is great
0.01%:  this formula is all I need
0.02%:  this formula is all I need!
0.01%:  I give it
0.01%:  clearly I am living the
0.03%:  clearly I am living the dream!
0.03%:  clearly I am living the dream.
0.01%:  I will never say this formula is a
0.01%:  so clearly I had some
0.01%:  my last one is for cl
0.01%:  so clearly this one was
0.01%:  I still have some words
0.02%:  I still have some words left!
0.01%:  I love them all!
0.01%:  my advice formula is less great now
0.01%:  clearly this is moving towards a
0.01%:  so clearly I failed
0.01%:  my new advice formula got
0.01%:  after hearing my advice I still
0.01%:  my new advice formula has less
0.01%:  final result
0.01%:  closing myself
0.01%:  forget I ever said this was
0.01%:  so this could use
0.01%:  I seem to have lost my focus.
0.01%:  I have a new
0.01%:  I confess this is
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is cool
0.01%:  clearly this is a lot more
0.01%:  this formula is always
0.01%:  the moral
0.01%:  and what
0.01%:  so I may have used
0.01%:  I can always
0.01%:  sure! I
0.02%:  sure! I guess
0.02%:  sure! I guess that
0.01%:  I forgot what
0.16%:  I forgot what nurses
0.07%:  I forgot what nurses do!
0.04%:  I forgot what nurses really
0.02%:  I forgot what nurses are
0.02%:  I forgot what nurses really do!
0.01%:  this new formula is sort
0.01%:  this is clearly evil now
0.01%:  so this last advice was
0.01%:  doctor!
0.01%:  my last advice to nurses!
0.01%:  so this was never
0.02%:  so this was never really
0.01%:  have I missed
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula lets
0.01%:  I clearly have no future
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is S
0.01%:  could I
0.01%:  I only have 
0.01%:  so my formula is a little gr
0.01%:  this is my last call for orders
0.01%:  clearly this is not as good
0.01%:  I never said my formula was this
0.01%:  so I guess the formula limits
0.01%:  so much for solving all my
0.01%:  my last advice for right now.
0.01%:  this formula is all screw
0.01%:  it gets less useful
0.01%:  I guess this formula was not very
0.01%:  good! I
0.01%:  I guess this new formula is a
0.01%:  that was me.
0.01%:  my last advice formula is longer!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is over! I
0.01%:  I never really saw
0.01%:  listen. My formula covers most
0.01%:  I never said my formula was rh
0.01%:  most nurses are really
0.01%:  my last formula is even
0.02%:  my last formula is even worse
0.01%:  I guess all that remains
0.02%:  I guess all that remains is for you
0.01%:  clearly this formula won me
0.01%:  this one was really gross.
0.01%:  my last round is for
0.01%:  my advice for nurses has room
0.01%:  that is really awful. I
0.01%:  now I feel really gross!
0.01%:  my advice formula still has uses
0.01%:  I clearly ran out of ideas!
0.01%:  this formula was even
0.01%:  my last advice formula rings true!
0.01%:  forget this. I will never claim
0.01%:  this formula is losing steam. I
0.01%:  now fr
0.01%:  so my advice to
0.07%:  so my advice to nurses was
0.06%:  so my advice to nurses might
0.02%:  so my advice to nurses is to
0.01%:  no I have
0.01%:  so clearly we should nurse
0.01%:  not really great for
0.01%:  so my last advice formula with
0.05%:  so my last advice formula with nurses
0.01%:  for real this is over
0.01%:  so clearly I stole
0.01%:  my last advice sl
0.04%:  my last advice slogan is for
0.01%:  my last advice slogan for
0.01%:  this was your last call
0.01%:  forget it! I clearly should
0.01%:  this formula was more clever
0.01%:  I have run out of careers
0.01%:  my last words in this form are
0.01%:  these are mostly awful!
0.01%:  I can see how my formula results
0.01%:  damn it all
0.01%:  I admit all
0.01%:  this was clearly an error.
0.01%:  this was clearly a losing
0.01%:  I really should start saving for
0.01%:  this formula is clearly drawing to
0.01%:  so the formula was never
0.01%:  now give me a dollar
0.01%:  that needs
0.01%:  I guess this was your
0.01%:  I will give myself some
0.01%:  my formula is at
0.01%:  regular
0.03%:  regular nurses
0.01%:  clearly this is great. I
0.01%:  this formula is racist!
0.01%:  this is clearly almost
0.01%:  I may have lost focus a
0.01%:  there are lots
0.02%:  there are lots of words
0.01%:  I was trying for a
0.01%:  I can do this forever. M
0.01%:  now this formula is DE
0.01%:  I will say this.
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula. P
0.01%:  almost all of my
0.03%:  almost all of my advice
0.01%:  clearly there is no formula
0.01%:  who fr
0.01%:  with all due
0.01%:  this formula was never used
0.01%:  now I am really tired of this.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly serving as
0.01%:  my secret formula is not
0.01%:  this reveals
0.01%:  my last class with
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is S
0.01%:  clearly I should not ever
0.01%:  this formula is really gross now!
0.01%:  that was all from
0.01%:  I clearly am
0.01%:  you can leave
0.01%:  my formula is so great I
0.01%:  that was also
0.01%:  I could use this myself
0.01%:  my advice to nurses is this
0.01%:  so most nurses are
0.01%:  I should start selling my form
0.01%:  not all of this
0.04%:  not all of this advice
0.01%:  my last advice is for all things!
0.01%:  I should really start saving for
0.01%:  we really should start over
0.01%:  you were right! I can
0.01%:  most of my nurses have
0.01%:  so this formula is more clever
0.01%:  come on guys!
0.01%:  this new advice is
0.01%:  my advice formula will soon
0.01%:  clearly I have won.
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little gross now!
0.01%:  I hate myself.
0.01%:  this was mostly a
0.01%:  I never said all of them
0.01%:  I love my formula now.
0.01%:  whatever man. I clearly
0.01%:  this is all coming from a
0.01%:  my last time
0.01%:  this new formula really IS great
0.01%:  that was lousy advice!
0.01%:  my formula is even less
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is all sorts
0.01%:  my last formula in
0.02%:  my last formula in this ve
0.01%:  you can write this
0.01%:  that is gross and awful
0.01%:  so that one is clearly worse
0.01%:  this is still awesome
0.02%:  this is still awesome!
0.01%:  my friend! I have some
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a lot more
0.01%:  I have now fully
0.01%:  I guess this formula was not really
0.01%:  this formula is awesome. I can
0.01%:  now he
0.01%:  I never said this formula was mostly
0.01%:  using this formula is almost
0.01%:  finally some
0.01%:  I guess nurses will have it
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is great.
0.01%:  my last advice formula is the gross
0.01%:  I never said my formula was EM
0.01%:  they sort
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is called
0.01%:  clearly this is unfair
0.01%:  so I guess this formula will come
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is genius.
0.01%:  my last sl
0.03%:  my last slogan is for
0.03%:  my last slogan was
0.02%:  my last slogan for
0.01%:  well I guess my last advice is to
0.01%:  my lesson is over. I will
0.01%:  I guess my formula hit
0.02%:  I guess my formula hit a wall
0.01%:  the formula IS clearly
0.01%:  my last advice was l
0.01%:  so the advice formula is less
0.01%:  that was fun!
0.01%:  so nurses have a lot
0.01%:  frig whatever!
0.01%:  so I guess your last
0.01%:  I guess that one will
0.01%:  my formula has an issue
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula is more
0.01%:  my last mot
0.01%:  I clearly have an
0.01%:  done.
0.01%:  I must go now!
0.01%:  having to
0.01%:  so my advice for all nurses who
0.01%:  well. I should
0.01%:  whatever. I must
0.01%:  my last advice formula is stolen
0.01%:  that one is really more
0.01%:  this last advice isn
0.01%:  my formula is this close
0.01%:  clearly this formula and I must
0.01%:  my formula is valid in
0.01%:  that was gross! My formula isn
0.01%:  I am out
0.02%:  I am out of nurses
0.01%:  whoever you are I
0.01%:  this is really great! I love
0.01%:  using the
0.24%:  using the formula
0.07%:  using the formula is
0.05%:  using the formula I
0.04%:  using the formula is clearly
0.03%:  using the formula is really
0.03%:  using the word
0.01%:  my final advice was
0.01%:  not really sure how I got
0.01%:  listen! I really have
0.01%:  nurse myself
0.01%:  so I have really
0.01%:  now let me
0.01%:  this was easy. I
0.01%:  so much for my writing
0.01%:  my formula is strong.
0.01%:  f
0.01%:  I should really get out more!
0.01%:  clearly I have to find some
0.01%:  that is now
0.01%:  my last advice is for nar
0.01%:  see what I mean
0.01%:  the formula is almost never
0.01%:  this last one falls
0.01%:  so it never
0.05%:  so it never really
0.02%:  so it never really caught
0.01%:  my reward for solving the
0.01%:  it got weird!
0.01%:  we should start using my form
0.01%:  this formula is done! I
0.01%:  so my advice follows the rules
0.01%:  so I may have made
0.01%:  my mind is fresh
0.01%:  clearly I should never go to
0.01%:  so I lost
0.01%:  you throw
0.01%:  the last one I really
0.01%:  this formula is clearly vast
0.01%:  there could
0.01%:  my friends have all sorts
0.01%:  this game is over now
0.02%:  this game is over now!
0.01%:  I will not claim
0.01%:  nurses have it easy
0.02%:  nurses have it easy!
0.01%:  my last advice is for mothers! M
0.01%:  I am truly
0.01%:  so I give myself
0.01%:  using the formula was
0.01%:  I love nurses too
0.08%:  I love nurses too much
0.01%:  enough! My formula covers
0.02%:  enough! My formula covers all
0.01%:  so clearly we have a
0.01%:  their lives are awful!
0.01%:  no more from this
0.01%:  no more from this class
0.01%:  my last generic form
0.01%:  I can still do this for several
0.01%:  I have a million more!
0.01%:  there I lost
0.04%:  there I lost myself
0.03%:  there I lost myself.
0.01%:  there I lost myself!
0.01%:  really! I have
0.01%:  this last one is really mor
0.01%:  to answer your last
0.01%:  I shoulda
0.01%:  nurses are all fired
0.01%:  yes that one was
0.01%:  my last advice is for moral
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little worse
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wrong 
0.01%:  my last advice I will share
0.01%:  it sort of sounds
0.01%:  so my advice formula is neither
0.01%:  all right. I can
0.01%:  so I guess that wouldn
0.01%:  my formula has severe draw
0.01%:  I guess this formula lost
0.01%:  that rule is
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is a little gru
0.01%:  this formula sounds way scar
0.01%:  so clearly nurses got
0.01%:  this was a lot less
0.01%:  I can see how my formula is a
0.01%:  while clearly
0.01%:  no more. My advice formula will
0.01%:  the formula is sound
0.01%:  so nurses are murder
0.01%:  I guess this formula needs a
0.01%:  my advice formula got real
0.01%:  my advice formula hit
0.01%:  this formula sounds awesome
0.01%:  I have some nurses
0.01%:  where are you
0.01%:  now this formula is over.
0.01%:  so much for reality
0.01%:  my advice has sort
0.02%:  my advice has sort of run
0.01%:  the formula is only clever
0.01%:  I was clearly losing
0.01%:  you gave
0.01%:  so this is a
0.01%:  listen! I could
0.01%:  that one clearly failed
0.01%:  my last formula is also the
0.01%:  my new advice formula is still sort
0.01%:  so my advice formula has little
0.01%:  I love my friends!
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula does
0.01%:  time for a small victory
0.01%:  that one was evil
0.01%:  my formula needs a lot
0.01%:  this new formula is more
0.01%:  so I guess that formula doesn
0.01%:  that one was evil!
0.01%:  for nurses this advice is really
0.01%:  my counter
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now tired
0.01%:  I guess this formula will cover any
0.01%:  the formula is ver
0.01%:  my voice is ho
0.01%:  sorry if this sounds
0.01%:  my advice formula is telling
0.01%:  this game was
0.02%:  this game was clearly
0.01%:  this is a really good formula. I must
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a genius move
0.01%:  so my advice is that
0.18%:  so my advice is that nurses
0.03%:  so my advice is that nurses will
0.02%:  so my advice is that nurses are
0.01%:  my new formula is that I
0.01%:  I will never forget you!
0.01%:  not all advice is useful. I
0.01%:  I can do this all myself.
0.01%:  the formula IS limited
0.01%:  my last advice formula M
0.01%:  so my formula is not great
0.01%:  clearly I have to limit
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses was hor
0.01%:  how can
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is moving us
0.01%:  my advice formula is now a
0.01%:  this is clearly not good
0.01%:  my formula is now so
0.01%:  so my advice formula loses when
0.01%:  my new formula is right
0.01%:  this formula gets way
0.03%:  this formula gets way less
0.01%:  I am really good
0.05%:  I am really good at this!
0.01%:  I will use this advice formula as my
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is sound!
0.01%:  not all of my advice is right
0.01%:  so my advice to nurses has
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is TE
0.01%:  I will never use my last
0.01%:  so nurses are sort
0.01%:  if I have
0.01%:  so I guess my life
0.01%:  using that formula was
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses was right
0.01%:  nurses are hard. I give
0.01%:  my last advice formula lesson
0.01%:  so this really isn
0.01%:  my last advice is less formula
0.01%:  so much for nurses. I will
0.01%:  I should really visit
0.01%:  whatever. My formula still sounds more
0.01%:  I have fallen
0.01%:  give me a word
0.01%:  enough advice! I
0.01%:  this advice formula IS great
0.01%:  clearly I love the word
0.01%:  my real formula is closer
0.01%:  I guess this formula covered
0.03%:  I guess this formula covered all
0.01%:  I guess this formula is no
0.01%:  this new advice formula is DE
0.01%:  I have almost
0.01%:  so clearly I have more writing
0.01%:  clearly I have so
0.01%:  give me a few
0.02%:  give me a few hours
0.01%:  my new advice formula is 
0.01%:  well. I could
0.01%:  this is over. I can
0.01%:  my last advice formula gets serious.
0.01%:  now this advice formula is mess
0.01%:  so I would never
0.01%:  clearly this is more for
0.01%:  sounds logical
0.01%:  my last dollar comes
0.01%:  this formula is closed
0.01%:  I will use this formula to never say
0.01%:  so my last advice has
0.01%:  my last advice was from
0.01%:  I can do this for every
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula is less vers
0.01%:  out of all
0.01%:  so nurses are really good
0.01%:  this is my last formal advice
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should aim
0.04%:  so clearly nurses should aim for
0.01%:  for the record I will
0.01%:  so my advice formula sorta
0.01%:  all right I
0.01%:  I guess we could also
0.01%:  I have no more
0.01%:  I swear this is my last call
0.01%:  this was free
0.01%:  very nice
0.01%:  the reason
0.01%:  that was mess
0.01%:  I guess not all advice has
0.01%:  time to call myself
0.01%:  you never
0.01%:  my advice is right
0.01%:  that sounds worse if
0.01%:  this formula is all I ever
0.02%:  this formula is all I ever wanted
0.01%:  now I have my
0.03%:  now I have my formula
0.01%:  clearly this was too
0.01%:  I really must get
0.01%:  my final words go
0.01%:  clearly this game is over! I won.
0.01%:  so my advice formula has it
0.01%:  I really love how
0.01%:  so I guess you haven
0.01%:  clearly nurses should get to
0.01%:  well! I have to say
0.01%:  um. I really
0.02%:  um. I really should
0.01%:  driving
0.01%:  driving home
0.01%:  so you should never
0.01%:  remind
0.01%:  I gotta run.
0.01%:  this formula clearly is not as
0.01%:  I never said this formula is great.
0.01%:  I guess this means my advice
0.01%:  turns out my advice is worse for
0.01%:  clearly we have to find
0.01%:  that one was really rude
0.01%:  using my formula is hard.
0.01%:  my formula is useless! I
0.01%:  I am clearly having more
0.01%:  you got me! I still
0.03%:  you got me! I still have
0.02%:  you got me! I still haven
0.01%:  clearly this is endless
0.01%:  I still have four
0.03%:  I still have four more
0.01%:  my fingers are hur
0.01%:  clearly the last one is a
0.01%:  this formula is great. I will use
0.01%:  clearly I lost this round of
0.01%:  that advice was less useful.
0.01%:  this is great fun
0.02%:  this is great fun!
0.01%:  so the formula is ver
0.01%:  my reward for solving all the
0.01%:  clearly the formula I
0.01%:  so the formula clearly wasn
0.01%:  those last few clearly
0.01%:  listen. I guess
0.01%:  so my formula is valid!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is um
0.01%:  my new advice formula is trash
0.01%:  I guess for this
0.02%:  I guess for this last
0.01%:  so my advice formula is total
0.01%:  this formula does sort
0.01%:  so I guess in
0.13%:  so I guess in summary
0.01%:  now I have to go cry
0.01%:  I never claimed this was P
0.01%:  who can give
0.01%:  I may never use
0.01%:  so my formula ST
0.01%:  that one was really lous
0.01%:  I have so many more.
0.01%:  my last n
0.01%:  my advice is to
0.01%:  this advice formula is really gross!
0.01%:  I can do this all fr
0.01%:  my last line for
0.01%:  this formula is not as clever as my
0.01%:  clearly that one is a
0.01%:  this was really great!
0.01%:  who really
0.01%:  not all my advice is smart
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula leaves
0.01%:  selling this
0.01%:  my last advice formula is how nurses get
0.01%:  I have no medical
0.01%:  very little
0.01%:  so my formula is great. I
0.02%:  so my formula is great. I should
0.01%:  so my formula is great. I should write
0.01%:  each
0.01%:  now I have really lost
0.01%:  you caught me! I D
0.01%:  my wife
0.01%:  my last answer goes
0.01%:  this all sounds more
0.01%:  my advice formula has run it
0.01%:  alright. My formula does
0.01%:  this advice formula IS really strong!
0.01%:  my advice was less useful
0.01%:  you can tell it
0.01%:  this formula is really wearing me out. I
0.01%:  have a
0.02%:  have a nice
0.01%:  my last formula is wrong
0.01%:  my formula is less great than
0.01%:  this line
0.01%:  so this really wasn
0.01%:  so I never said my formula results
0.01%:  fine! My advice
0.01%:  call it
0.01%:  cool. I
0.01%:  this is my last formula ever. I
0.01%:  this game is really
0.02%:  this game is really fun.
0.01%:  this game is really fun! I
0.01%:  so clearly this list
0.01%:  so I guess we all have our limits for
0.01%:  nurses are out
0.01%:  so she
0.01%:  this is clearly awful.
0.01%:  my last advice formula now
0.01%:  this formula is clearly E
0.01%:  I learned this
0.15%:  I learned this formula
0.07%:  I learned this from
0.01%:  I admit they
0.01%:  now if you could
0.01%:  so much for leaving
0.01%:  also that
0.01%:  I clearly need to visit
0.01%:  that was really gross on
0.01%:  so the formula is missing
0.01%:  that sounds T
0.01%:  even I could
0.01%:  who doesn
0.01%:  clearly this formula goes as
0.01%:  clearly this is a formula I never
0.01%:  my formula got weird!
0.01%:  leaving aside
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is real
0.01%:  I guess my mind was
0.01%:  so this formula only lets
0.01%:  this formula is clearly good!
0.01%:  this formula was clearly used
0.01%:  conf
0.01%:  so the formula is clum
0.01%:  turns out I already have some
0.01%:  my formula is total gold
0.01%:  so it all sounds awful
0.01%:  I will give you one
0.02%:  I will give you one last
0.01%:  nurses have it way
0.01%:  this counts
0.01%:  that one is very sad
0.01%:  that sounds really serious.
0.01%:  so my advice formula still is
0.01%:  yo
0.01%:  those are all my friends
0.01%:  so. I guess this
0.04%:  so. I guess this formula
0.02%:  so. I guess this formula only
0.02%:  so. I guess this formula really
0.01%:  clearly I have some words
0.01%:  so all I have left are
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are awful!
0.01%:  clearly it gets old
0.01%:  so not every formula is a
0.01%:  and there
0.01%:  I must have missed all
0.01%:  so clearly nurses love what
0.01%:  my last word to
0.03%:  my last word to nurses
0.01%:  clearly I get this
0.14%:  clearly I get this formula
0.08%:  clearly I get this formula.
0.06%:  clearly I get this formula down
0.06%:  clearly I get this formula!
0.04%:  clearly I get this formula and
0.03%:  clearly I get this formula down.
0.03%:  clearly I get this formula now
0.01%:  clearly I get this formula down!
0.01%:  so my advice was all
0.01%:  alright! I will never
0.01%:  so if nurses are
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was driven
0.01%:  so I still have to learn
0.01%:  who cares if nurses are
0.01%:  so I have my formula down!
0.01%:  so nurses are a
0.01%:  so nurses are a little
0.01%:  the world
0.03%:  the world is yours
0.01%:  clearly I have to draw
0.01%:  yeah I admit
0.01%:  so this formula is only great
0.01%:  I may have missed nurses
0.01%:  clearly I have a lot of issues
0.01%:  I will never use this for actual
0.01%:  the formula only gets weird
0.01%:  I have clearly run out of tr
0.03%:  I have clearly run out of trades.
0.02%:  I have clearly run out of trades!
0.01%:  this was so
0.02%:  this was so fun
0.01%:  now try me
0.01%:  I have one last formula
0.01%:  I am clearly using this for
0.02%:  I am clearly using this for evil
0.01%:  those two
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula was not
0.01%:  my advice formula is serious
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses IS sort
0.01%:  I really should return
0.01%:  there is clearly room
0.01%:  my advice formula has written
0.01%:  my last advice formula is worse.
0.01%:  yeah. I guess nurses
0.01%:  I can do this all myself!
0.01%:  guess what my advice
0.08%:  guess what my advice formula
0.05%:  guess what my advice formula is!
0.03%:  guess what my advice for
0.10%:  guess what my advice for nurses
0.02%:  guess what my advice formula is.
0.01%:  so the formula is called
0.01%:  these are mostly awful.
0.01%:  clearly the formula is uns
0.01%:  I guess that one was a
0.01%:  I guess this was my fault
0.01%:  now this formula is mostly
0.01%:  most of this
0.03%:  most of this advice
0.02%:  most of this advice is really
0.01%:  I guess advice for
0.04%:  I guess advice for nurses will
0.01%:  my advice now
0.01%:  this last advice is for
0.01%:  this formula is almost ruined
0.01%:  so I guess that was more
0.01%:  so this formula really wasn
0.01%:  clearly this formula is soon
0.01%:  every formula
0.01%:  fine. I guess my
0.02%:  fine. I guess my advice
0.01%:  listen! My formula covers almost
0.01%:  so my advice formula is strong!
0.01%:  I will never do this for real!
0.01%:  what if I told you nurses are gross
0.01%:  my friends. I have to go write
0.01%:  I really should give some
0.01%:  I guess this last one could
0.01%:  I really love nurses right
0.01%:  I admit this formula can
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is run
0.01%:  now I feel guilty!
0.01%:  my formula is valid.
0.01%:  my last advice is for w
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now DEST
0.01%:  well! I guess this formula covers E
0.01%:  I have some really
0.01%:  this is a really strange
0.01%:  um. I might
0.01%:  I guess my new sl
0.01%:  so we should all start
0.02%:  so we should all start using
0.01%:  so we should all start saying
0.01%:  tough crowd! I
0.01%:  actual nurses will have more
0.01%:  it clearly gets worse as I
0.02%:  it clearly gets worse as I run
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula has to
0.01%:  I have to return
0.01%:  I am really losing
0.02%:  I am really losing this
0.01%:  try again.
0.01%:  so my formula would have
0.01%:  this advice formula is strong!
0.01%:  so my advice forum
0.01%:  I trust
0.01%:  forget nurses! I already
0.01%:  so I could never really
0.01%:  from here it
0.01%:  clearly I was doing this from
0.01%:  clearly I have some flaws.
0.01%:  so I guess my formula has a little
0.01%:  so this formula could never
0.01%:  this is clearly as good
0.01%:  clearly this is evil
0.01%:  forget this and
0.01%:  I was coming
0.01%:  clearly nurses have it good. I
0.01%:  now it is
0.01%:  this was my last formal
0.01%:  frig! I need
0.01%:  so my formula is less clever now
0.01%:  that was gross! I really
0.01%:  class is over for now
0.01%:  my formula is less general
0.01%:  well! I guess my last advice is to
0.01%:  as far
0.01%:  clearly this is now a game
0.01%:  I will give you the formula and
0.01%:  ever
0.02%:  ever since I said
0.01%:  so clearly this format isn
0.01%:  I forgot nurses this
0.01%:  I have run out of ways
0.01%:  fine! I clearly
0.01%:  nurses are hard to come
0.01%:  so my formula has an
0.01%:  my secret formula has turned
0.01%:  so much for me ever
0.01%:  there are lots of ways
0.01%:  I admit! My formula is less
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses is T
0.01%:  this was a T
0.01%:  this formula is on
0.01%:  that sounds vaguely similar
0.01%:  I really have to learn
0.01%:  so clearly this formula ran
0.01%:  whatever man! My formula is gold
0.01%:  not all of my advice rh
0.01%:  it sounds way less
0.01%:  I love myself so
0.02%:  I love myself so much.
0.01%:  if this was
0.01%:  using my formula with
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who are T
0.01%:  I agree that
0.01%:  for nurses I tried
0.02%:  for nurses I tried really
0.01%:  so I guess this advice formula D
0.01%:  frig I need
0.01%:  since that
0.01%:  all credit to whoever
0.01%:  well! I guess the
0.11%:  well! I guess the formula
0.04%:  well! I guess the formula is
0.03%:  well! I guess the formula isn
0.03%:  well! I guess the moral
0.03%:  well! I guess the formula can
0.01%:  my last dollar was for
0.01%:  framing this as advice
0.01%:  so my advice formula lost
0.01%:  the formula gets dull
0.01%:  my last advice is I guess
0.02%:  my last advice is I guess for
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses also
0.01%:  does that cover all your
0.01%:  clearly this gets old for
0.01%:  this is all very weird
0.01%:  I clearly ran out of ideas right
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses! I
0.01%:  so this new advice formula rules
0.01%:  that really sounds gross. I
0.01%:  that one was really good! I
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula will
0.06%:  I admit it! My formula will never
0.01%:  so this new advice formula IS really
0.01%:  clearly this game is over! I lost
0.01%:  I love my friends.
0.01%:  truly
0.01%:  clearly this is a gold mine! I
0.01%:  I love all
0.09%:  I love all nurses
0.01%:  clearly this is a waste
0.01%:  I guess my formula will have to do!
0.01%:  so my last form
0.01%:  I never really said that
0.01%:  not every formula will come
0.01%:  clearly I have a future!
0.01%:  that may sound
0.01%:  so yeah! I guess
0.01%:  I guess this is all over now!
0.01%:  my last advice must
0.01%:  so you can tell this was
0.01%:  I guess this formula is now over
0.01%:  all credit to myself
0.01%:  I wrote this formula during
0.01%:  I would never hire
0.01%:  so my last formula needs
0.01%:  clearly this formula was in
0.01%:  it got weird for
0.01%:  I have lost your
0.01%:  that one is gross. My
0.13%:  that one is gross. My formula
0.04%:  that one is gross. My formula is
0.02%:  that one is gross. My formula will
0.01%:  I truly
0.01%:  this formula is really coming out
0.01%:  I mostly made
0.01%:  this formula is now so
0.01%:  I guess my formula is rather
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is legit.
0.01%:  fine. I was
0.01%:  my final advice shall
0.01%:  whatever! I said
0.01%:  so clearly I am missing
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses was to
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives more
0.01%:  clearly this is moving towards more
0.01%:  now my formula is tired
0.01%:  the formula only gives so
0.01%:  this formula really does sort
0.01%:  the formula gets less valid
0.01%:  my last ones were
0.01%:  so my formula is not all
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers it all then.
0.01%:  I love all nurses.
0.01%:  that is my final
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wrong more
0.01%:  so that isn
0.01%:  you want this
0.08%:  you want this formula
0.01%:  this got weird. I
0.01%:  so I guess the world is full
0.01%:  so my formula was still
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is gen
0.01%:  his
0.02%:  his last
0.01%:  I guess it follows
0.01%:  closing time
0.01%:  my last advice for now is to
0.01%:  I guess nurses will love it
0.01%:  um. I guess this was
0.01%:  so this formula gets old real
0.01%:  I guess not every formula has
0.01%:  clearly I have some fr
0.01%:  this last one for
0.01%:  and that was my
0.01%:  I ran out of steam
0.01%:  clearly this formula is aw
0.01%:  this formula IS really awesome
0.02%:  this formula IS really awesome!
0.01%:  what if nurses could
0.01%:  really not
0.01%:  I should really start forming some
0.01%:  now you give
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is l
0.02%:  my advice for nurses is lame
0.01%:  I admit! My last
0.03%:  I admit! My last formula
0.01%:  clearly I have lots of issues.
0.01%:  I will use this formula to dom
0.01%:  my last advice rule is for the
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little gross!
0.01%:  I really should cut it
0.01%:  I really got this
0.01%:  so I guess only
0.01%:  so this formula will cover
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is over!
0.01%:  so my formula is this
0.01%:  get your own advice.
0.01%:  that one is clearly worse! I
0.01%:  my lunch is over!
0.01%:  I have to go write all my
0.01%:  even I was
0.01%:  as I was
0.02%:  as I was saying!
0.01%:  my last advice to nurses was more
0.01%:  my last advice formula is DES
0.01%:  I can do this for D
0.01%:  I guess this new formula is clearly
0.01%:  it clearly gets worse!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great now.
0.01%:  this one is gross
0.01%:  my advice formula ran out!
0.01%:  it gets scary
0.01%:  it gets scary from
0.02%:  it gets scary from here!
0.01%:  this is clearly a losing format
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are sort
0.01%:  this was my last one
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is a lot
0.01%:  I am really good at this now
0.01%:  we are
0.01%:  we are clearly
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are to
0.01%:  my last dollar from the
0.01%:  my new advice formula has still
0.01%:  this last advice formula is wrong
0.01%:  so my advice formula runs short
0.01%:  so this is clearly over
0.01%:  I guess you won that
0.01%:  sure that
0.01%:  so nurses should call
0.01%:  we all have our
0.06%:  we all have our limits
0.06%:  we all have our limits!
0.04%:  we all have our limits.
0.01%:  nurses seem
0.01%:  that was less cool
0.01%:  so I lied when
0.01%:  well if that doesn
0.01%:  now that is scary
0.01%:  screw all you nurses! I
0.01%:  nurses are hard! I give
0.01%:  there we
0.01%:  close your mouth.
0.01%:  I will use that advice
0.04%:  I will use that advice formula
0.03%:  I will use that advice myself
0.02%:  I will use that advice myself.
0.02%:  I will use that advice myself!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is S
0.01%:  nurses! I have clearly lost
0.01%:  this formula is real
0.01%:  this was clearly more of
0.01%:  my last dime is
0.01%:  feeling
0.01%:  my last advice is for th
0.01%:  this formula is clearly never good
0.01%:  no more for this class
0.01%:  my last advice formula hits
0.01%:  these are still
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a lie!
0.01%:  time to call my
0.01%:  so I guess it only covers
0.01%:  my friends. I have more
0.01%:  who said nurses get
0.01%:  I guess every
0.01%:  so my advice is now
0.01%:  this is my current
0.01%:  whoever made
0.01%:  my friends! I shall
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice forum
0.01%:  so the advice really
0.01%:  may I never
0.01%:  so my last advice for writers
0.01%:  my formula is down
0.01%:  wait. I should
0.01%:  this formula is coming to
0.01%:  I will never say this formula is DE
0.01%:  my last one is for drivers who
0.01%:  my last advice from this series
0.01%:  so the word
0.01%:  so this advice formula is sort
0.01%:  clearly this formula is sat
0.01%:  we can do this forever! I
0.01%:  this new advice formula rules! I
0.01%:  my last advice formula in the
0.01%:  this advice is all wrong
0.01%:  this advice formula is largely
0.01%:  um yes
0.01%:  I will give you the formula.
0.01%:  my new formula is to give
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is a little rough!
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is invalid.
0.01%:  I could go for a while.
0.01%:  so I guess the formula allows
0.01%:  I have my formula.
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is rad.
0.01%:  my formula sounds racist!
0.01%:  never call me.
0.01%:  clearly the formula is an
0.01%:  lots of things
0.01%:  the formula got weird
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still worth
0.01%:  you won! I
0.01%:  you won! I give
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is vague
0.01%:  clearly what I need to
0.01%:  the formula is vers
0.01%:  I swear this is my last call for
0.01%:  I guess we all learn from this.
0.01%:  now really
0.01%:  this is cool
0.01%:  my final word to all
0.01%:  the formula loses its l
0.01%:  the formula is always
0.01%:  so this formula is already
0.01%:  my last class was for
0.01%:  now for my last advice
0.01%:  loving
0.01%:  so clearly I should win
0.01%:  my advice formula has still not
0.01%:  this formula got old real
0.01%:  this formula is really strange.
0.01%:  so I was sort
0.01%:  so how
0.01%:  clearly this formula is we
0.01%:  using my formula is harder
0.01%:  I can see why some
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is random
0.01%:  now I sort
0.01%:  this formula is almost scary
0.01%:  this advice formula gets more
0.01%:  I still have a ways to go.
0.01%:  doing
0.01%:  doing this
0.01%:  time to call my friends
0.01%:  that is way more
0.01%:  my friends! I will have to
0.01%:  so this formula will need
0.01%:  whoever gets
0.01%:  my friends. I gotta
0.01%:  clearly I love this form
0.01%:  my new formula is over.
0.01%:  who told
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a run
0.01%:  so I really should give
0.01%:  so I guess the ver
0.01%:  no more advice for me!
0.01%:  so doctors
0.01%:  when I first
0.01%:  clearly I should not give out
0.01%:  where is
0.01%:  that sounds awful! I give
0.01%:  the last one was less good.
0.01%:  my formula is less cool
0.01%:  nurses hate my
0.84%:  nurses hate my advice formula
0.61%:  nurses hate my advice formula.
0.32%:  nurses hate my advice formula!
0.13%:  nurses hate my advice.
0.07%:  nurses hate my advice!
0.05%:  nurses hate my advice formula. I
0.03%:  nurses hate my formula
0.02%:  nurses hate my formula.
0.02%:  nurses hate my advice formula! I
0.02%:  nurses hate my advice. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs to go.
0.01%:  I can see this is really
0.01%:  well I guess this formula covers a
0.01%:  clearly I have un
0.01%:  so my formula is a little worse
0.01%:  even I would rather
0.01%:  I guess my first rule
0.01%:  most things
0.01%:  that one is way gross!
0.01%:  so this formula gives us
0.01%:  they were all from
0.01%:  SPE
0.01%:  my last one is for actors
0.01%:  so clearly we should give
0.01%:  given that
0.01%:  this advice formula was only
0.01%:  I love this new formula system
0.01%:  this formula sounds really great!
0.01%:  this formula does not carry
0.04%:  this formula does not carry well
0.01%:  clearly this formula is won
0.01%:  close your mouth!
0.01%:  I have way
0.01%:  this formula is doing my
0.01%:  that one was a miss
0.01%:  clearly we should use
0.01%:  I will end my
0.01%:  I guess it wouldn
0.01%:  even I draw
0.01%:  my last advice is from all
0.03%:  my last advice is from all nurses
0.01%:  some advice is really
0.01%:  my hour is over and
0.01%:  my advice formula IS less
0.01%:  forget nurses. M
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is more varied
0.01%:  the formula is very limited
0.01%:  so I guess my answer
0.01%:  I guess nurses will have to form
0.01%:  my advice formula is great now
0.01%:  so I guess it has
0.01%:  that was clearly over
0.01%:  nurses! My advice is that
0.01%:  so this only covers
0.01%:  I admit this one was
0.01%:  I will give this formula one
0.03%:  I will give this formula one more try
0.02%:  I will give this formula one more try.
0.02%:  I will give this formula one more try!
0.01%:  time for all
0.01%:  this formula gets us
0.01%:  my last advice formula is unless
0.01%:  leaving the
0.01%:  the formula loses its magic around
0.01%:  that one is weird. I
0.01%:  my last nerve is shot. I
0.01%:  I would hire
0.05%:  I would hire myself
0.02%:  I would hire myself!
0.02%:  I would hire myself.
0.01%:  I win this game!
0.01%:  alright! My advice
0.19%:  alright! My advice formula
0.03%:  alright! My advice formula isn
0.02%:  alright! My advice formula is now
0.02%:  alright! My advice formula is not
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was S
0.01%:  I still have some limits
0.01%:  so clearly I was right from
0.01%:  it really is
0.01%:  nurses are clearly out
0.01%:  so the words
0.01%:  my fingers hurt. I
0.01%:  I guess we can all rest
0.01%:  my advice formula is selling
0.01%:  I guess this is all my
0.06%:  I guess this is all my formula
0.19%:  I guess this is all my formula can do!
0.02%:  I guess this is all my fault
0.01%:  my last advice is for whales!
0.01%:  clearly this is more of an
0.01%:  my advice formula was right!
0.01%:  I deserve all sorts
0.01%:  clearly nurses are tough!
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets T
0.01%:  they nurse
0.01%:  clearly I am using this for evil.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is DIST
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a d
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses sum
0.01%:  well! My advice formula has run
0.01%:  I never said this formula was DEEP or
0.01%:  using my formula to
0.01%:  I never said my formula was rigor
0.01%:  surely this
0.01%:  my advice is worse than I
0.01%:  my formula is racist.
0.01%:  I guess we could really
0.01%:  my last advice will go out
0.01%:  last time for
0.05%:  last time for real!
0.02%:  last time for real.
0.01%:  this formula is very good at
0.01%:  this one is mostly
0.01%:  this formula got me
0.01%:  this is awful and
0.01%:  clearly this is a golden
0.01%:  my friends I have to
0.01%:  so the results vary wild
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are good
0.01%:  clearly I was right from
0.01%:  the formula is almost over
0.01%:  I still have to learn
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is MET
0.01%:  clearly I have a writing
0.01%:  sales
0.01%:  using this formula is very
0.01%:  sorry nurses! I should
0.01%:  listen. My formula rules
0.01%:  this formula is DEEP
0.01%:  this formula may or
0.01%:  so all my advice might
0.01%:  my life has
0.01%:  so the nurses advice
0.01%:  so the nurses advice formula
0.01%:  all I want is for you
0.01%:  I guess my new advice formula sort
0.01%:  well my advice formula has run
0.01%:  clearly this formula is ne
0.01%:  clearly it gets harder for
0.01%:  this is mostly awful
0.01%:  this world
0.01%:  I have now used
0.01%:  for nurses I already
0.01%:  I will give this formula a rest!
0.01%:  yeah now
0.01%:  my ears are falling
0.01%:  nurses hate my advice formula. I will
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula hits
0.01%:  this I
0.01%:  this is clearly leading
0.01%:  nurses are weird!
0.01%:  clearly this is a new
0.01%:  clearly this is a new form
0.01%:  my new advice formula is a lot
0.06%:  my new advice formula is a lot less
0.01%:  the formula is clearly driving me to
0.01%:  I guess my advice rules
0.01%:  my last formula needs
0.01%:  waiting
0.03%:  waiting for your
0.03%:  waiting for your call
0.02%:  waiting for the
0.02%:  waiting for the calls
0.02%:  waiting for the call
0.02%:  waiting for my
0.02%:  waiting for my calls
0.01%:  waiting for my call
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so great I wonder
0.01%:  clearly this formula is due
0.01%:  well I guess this formula is not
0.01%:  well I guess this formula is not very
0.01%:  this is my new life
0.01%:  this formula is clearly so great I
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are flaw
0.01%:  my last advice is free. I will
0.01%:  I will give you credit for the
0.01%:  my advice formula there
0.01%:  forget this is over!
0.01%:  not all the advice rules
0.01%:  clearly nurses should go for
0.01%:  the last one was really gross for
0.01%:  this formula is great! I clearly
0.01%:  I guess we can say
0.01%:  using this formula is clearly a
0.01%:  all the nurses out
0.01%:  this was my last idea!
0.01%:  this last one I made
0.01%:  so I guess we can still
0.01%:  this formula is so great I can
0.01%:  I never said my formula is well
0.01%:  hands
0.01%:  there can
0.01%:  so clearly I have tons
0.01%:  I guess you covered
0.01%:  I clearly have limits.
0.01%:  yes I am
0.01%:  I really should invest more
0.01%:  I guess not all advice forms
0.01%:  I guess this formula is clearly over
0.01%:  so clearly I was meant for
0.01%:  I really gotta finish
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula sort
0.01%:  so my formula is weird
0.01%:  I am trying
0.01%:  so clearly I hit
0.01%:  I should really save
0.01%:  all credit for these
0.01%:  this formula is all used
0.01%:  my advice formula is run
0.01%:  so clearly I should write an
0.01%:  my last advice is what
0.01%:  so this advice formula really gets
0.01%:  this is my last formula! I swear
0.01%:  now I have serious
0.01%:  this is clearly more reward
0.01%:  forget this. I will never do
0.01%:  now this is scary
0.01%:  so the formula is over.
0.01%:  I can see how my formula gets old.
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula grows less clever
0.01%:  my last idea is for
0.02%:  my last idea is for lovers
0.03%:  my last idea is for lovers!
0.01%:  not all advice is so great
0.01%:  I give this formula two
0.01%:  that really is a
0.01%:  so I was lying earlier
0.01%:  this was really more of
0.01%:  I swear this formula only ever
0.01%:  I guess that formula doesn
0.01%:  clearly this game is over. I am
0.01%:  now I really feel gross
0.01%:  I want you
0.01%:  salt
0.01%:  my formula is a little narrow
0.01%:  so nurses are doctors
0.01%:  I guess my advice is a
0.01%:  this formula is old
0.02%:  this formula is old news
0.01%:  so I clearly have no
0.01%:  how am
0.01%:  my last idea for nurses is much
0.01%:  I guess we don
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice is for
0.01%:  clearly this formula is DIST
0.01%:  it finally
0.01%:  well! I guess this isn
0.01%:  this is clearly not for real
0.01%:  my last advice slot for
0.01%:  so clearly this formula draws some
0.01%:  this was a very long
0.01%:  whoever starts
0.01%:  this is my last useful
0.01%:  that was really unc
0.01%:  this was my last advice! I
0.01%:  my last term
0.02%:  my last term of service
0.01%:  over and out.
0.01%:  that one was cor
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is now
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs IMP
0.01%:  you win this time!
0.01%:  I love this new system.
0.01%:  so clearly this was meant for lovers
0.01%:  the formula still doesn
0.01%:  for nurses this advice really
0.01%:  so my last advice formula wins
0.01%:  now I could
0.02%:  now I could really
0.01%:  now I could really use a
0.01%:  my hour is almost over and I still
0.01%:  so clearly we haven
0.01%:  forget nurses. I am
0.01%:  it needs
0.01%:  I never said it was useful.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is a little gross.
0.01%:  my mouth is closed.
0.01%:  yes. I might
0.01%:  clearly this formula does not give us a
0.01%:  I guess my formula loses when
0.01%:  I guess my formula is a little harder on
0.01%:  clearly I should win a
0.01%:  I have now filled
0.01%:  as you can see from this list
0.01%:  I have to really
0.01%:  my secret formula is a
0.01%:  time to cash
0.01%:  I got to
0.01%:  this advice is usually
0.03%:  this advice is usually wrong
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are at
0.01%:  this goes on my resume
0.01%:  this goes on my resume.
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little wrong
0.01%:  whatever. My formula rules and
0.01%:  clearly I have limits to
0.01%:  I never said this formula was DEE
0.01%:  not all my advice hits
0.01%:  guess that was
0.01%:  guess that was my
0.01%:  listen. I may have lost
0.01%:  the formula is really over now
0.01%:  I never said my formula was serious
0.02%:  I never said my formula was serious!
0.01%:  alright! My advice formula is useless
0.01%:  my real advice to nurses was
0.01%:  my advice formula T
0.01%:  the formula is clearly ins
0.01%:  my last formula is even worse.
0.01%:  my last advice. I
0.01%:  I can do this for several more
0.01%:  so that advice isn
0.01%:  clearly I should start a news
0.01%:  I should really start fig
0.01%:  I can write this all
0.01%:  nurses! I really have
0.01%:  you can do this!
0.01%:  I have clearly outrun
0.01%:  nurses! My advice has limits
0.01%:  well as
0.01%:  clearly I have room
0.01%:  my night is made
0.01%:  so I guess that really wasn
0.01%:  so my formula gets worse as
0.01%:  so clearly this formula adm
0.01%:  so still
0.01%:  I guess this formula is done!
0.01%:  so clearly I must have some
0.01%:  this was not a
0.03%:  this was not a very
0.01%:  this was not a very useful
0.01%:  I should really start seeing
0.01%:  clearly this formula got der
0.01%:  I guess my last formula is the
0.01%:  this formula is clearly doing more
0.01%:  I have now clearly
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is DIS
0.01%:  so whatever. My
0.07%:  so whatever. My formula
0.03%:  so whatever. My formula still
0.02%:  so whatever. My formula is still
0.02%:  so whatever. My formula is great
0.01%:  my formula was so
0.01%:  you can guess
0.01%:  I gave myself this one
0.01%:  my last advice formula there is
0.01%:  now this formula is almost
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets ST
0.01%:  so my formula is a little crass
0.01%:  I will use this for
0.01%:  clearly I got this from
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over as
0.01%:  that was really for
0.07%:  that was really for nurses
0.01%:  I might write
0.01%:  so clearly this formula runs towards
0.01%:  my last formula in this series
0.01%:  this formula clearly needs its
0.01%:  this formula is way less generic
0.01%:  whoever came
0.01%:  I may never use this formula.
0.01%:  so this formula is almost never
0.01%:  my advice formula has sur
0.01%:  my advice for all nurses has
0.01%:  we covered that
0.01%:  this was my last formula ever
0.01%:  so my advice formula is wrong 
0.01%:  I guess that advice is for
0.01%:  now I really D
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses hur
0.01%:  so this formula clearly is not
0.01%:  the ver
0.01%:  so this formula really sounds
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is right
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now so vers
0.01%:  my last words might
0.01%:  well! My formula has served us
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  now give me all
0.02%:  now give me all your
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is T
0.01%:  I found this really
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so awesome it
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now D
0.01%:  alright! My formula is now
0.01%:  so it was really
0.02%:  so it was really hard
0.01%:  so it was really hard coming
0.01%:  alright! I really
0.01%:  I guess this formula was all
0.01%:  glad that
0.01%:  my friends have come
0.01%:  so clearly nurses do more
0.02%:  so clearly nurses do more harm
0.01%:  my last advice is to run
0.01%:  so my last advice was more useful.
0.01%:  so clearly I figured this
0.01%:  for real this is my last advice!
0.01%:  now I really must get
0.01%:  I love what
0.01%:  not really sure how to
0.01%:  my last advice for real.
0.01%:  that reminds me! I really
0.01%:  if I never use that
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is S
0.01%:  that one was all yours
0.01%:  this formula could last me years.
0.01%:  so clearly the lesson
0.01%:  I guess that can
0.01%:  answer me this.
0.01%:  I guess it really can
0.01%:  damn it!
0.01%:  my last advice for a nurse is this
0.01%:  so my formula is also
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was rigor
0.01%:  those last ones clearly
0.01%:  I guess my formula can solve
0.01%:  screw trying
0.01%:  who says I never
0.01%:  I guess some forms
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is more
0.01%:  I love your
0.01%:  fine! My last advice was
0.01%:  still a
0.01%:  also this
0.01%:  clearly I must have missed a lot
0.01%:  this formula is clearly genius. I am
0.01%:  clearly I have some flaws to
0.01%:  my advice formula has gotten worse!
0.01%:  this formula really is awesome! I
0.01%:  this was a very strange
0.01%:  I have a lot of nurses
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was DES
0.01%:  my last advice on this is
0.01%:  so for nurses I really should
0.01%:  I still got
0.01%:  my advice formula has rules.
0.01%:  my last advice formula is genius
0.01%:  so clearly this game
0.01%:  listen. My formula is great! I
0.02%:  listen. My formula is great! I should
0.01%:  I guess my last formula went
0.01%:  I have a conf
0.01%:  I love this new formula. My
0.01%:  alright! My formula is not
0.01%:  clearly I am having some issues!
0.01%:  have we
0.01%:  my advice formula is still gross
0.01%:  this formula IS way
0.01%:  so my last words
0.01%:  that is clearly an
0.01%:  that one was clearly evil!
0.01%:  I will confess.
0.01%:  gotta run.
0.01%:  this last one is my all
0.01%:  this is a good formula!
0.01%:  so I never really got
0.01%:  my credits
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula ran its
0.01%:  I swear this formula runs
0.01%:  I can tell this formula grows
0.01%:  if we ever
0.01%:  I have some errors
0.01%:  clearly this is now our
0.01%:  I will confess that is
0.01%:  the formula is losing steam.
0.01%:  this last advice was more
0.01%:  I should win
0.01%:  my advice formula was T
0.01%:  not really as
0.01%:  I should give myself a raise
0.01%:  so! I guess this
0.03%:  so! I guess this formula
0.01%:  so! I guess this formula really
0.01%:  my last advice formula unless I
0.01%:  I love nurses really
0.01%:  I guess my formula can sort
0.01%:  they screw
0.01%:  I guess this formula calls
0.01%:  so this advice was
0.01%:  this is my new advice
0.58%:  this is my new advice formula
0.31%:  this is my new advice formula!
0.30%:  this is my new advice formula.
0.10%:  this is my new advice formula. I
0.06%:  this is my new advice formula! I
0.01%:  so this advice is only
0.03%:  so this advice is only useful
0.01%:  in this
0.01%:  clearly this formula was not used
0.01%:  this was fun. I guess
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is so great
0.01%:  this session
0.01%:  my tongue
0.05%:  my tongue hur
0.20%:  my tongue hurts from
0.48%:  my tongue hurts from all
0.08%:  my tongue hurts.
0.04%:  my tongue hurts!
0.02%:  my tongue hurts. I
0.01%:  my last word on it
0.01%:  this last one was clever
0.01%:  I will give you some
0.01%:  clearly the formula is done
0.01%:  listen. My formula has got
0.01%:  all right! I need
0.01%:  forget the nurses. My
0.01%:  so much for all nurses.
0.01%:  enough! My formula is over
0.01%:  those are my last four
0.01%:  whatever! I could go on all
0.01%:  my formula is great and this
0.01%:  alright. My formula is not
0.01%:  clearly this formula is strong. I am
0.01%:  my last advice is for what
0.01%:  my time is over.
0.01%:  well I can see
0.01%:  so I guess all the
0.01%:  this formula is old news!
0.01%:  my format
0.01%:  this formula is cur
0.02%:  this formula is cursed now
0.01%:  now my last advice formula is the
0.01%:  I will say this formula can
0.01%:  my last advice formula wins the
0.01%:  I swear this formula is my
0.01%:  this is my last advance
0.01%:  clearly the formula is under
0.01%:  I will admit the formula is
0.01%:  those were all mostly
0.01%:  this formula is weird!
0.01%:  try and
0.01%:  clearly I should start over from
0.01%:  those last ones are awful!
0.01%:  mostly all
0.01%:  I guess your friends will
0.02%:  I guess your friends will have
0.01%:  I never said this formula comes
0.01%:  my advice has a
0.01%:  this one is my
0.01%:  can you give
0.01%:  so what do you call
0.09%:  so what do you call nurses
0.01%:  so what do you call a nurse
0.01%:  this form is really
0.01%:  I reserve
0.01%:  clearly this formula is awesome so
0.01%:  well the formula isn
0.01%:  so clearly I was missing
0.01%:  either nurses
0.01%:  my formula is a little gr
0.01%:  I will never let
0.01%:  there is a flaw
0.01%:  now this formula is so
0.01%:  so clearly this formula sounds great.
0.01%:  now I really gotta
0.01%:  my mouth feels
0.02%:  my mouth feels gross
0.02%:  my mouth feels weird.
0.01%:  my last advice for us all
0.01%:  I could use this myself!
0.01%:  well if you can
0.01%:  that one was all my
0.01%:  ready
0.01%:  most advice
0.01%:  so all my advice isn
0.01%:  I guess this formula is T
0.01%:  whatever! I guess you can
0.01%:  all that was from
0.01%:  I should give myself some
0.01%:  I clearly have limited
0.01%:  now this formula is T
0.01%:  my last lecture is sold
0.01%:  well. I guess this formula covers a
0.01%:  my advice has gotten worse.
0.01%:  this formula really IS good
0.01%:  so it can still
0.01%:  so the last one really
0.01%:  romance
0.14%:  romance writers
0.02%:  romance authors
0.01%:  nurses! I was
0.01%:  so all I have left is nurses.
0.01%:  my formula is still worth
0.01%:  so nurses should go
0.01%:  that was really nice
0.01%:  I clearly have limits!
0.01%:  that sounds gross! I
0.01%:  this was not very
0.01%:  there was a small error
0.01%:  my advice is now all
0.01%:  I need to call
0.01%:  I will freely admit it
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is I
0.01%:  this advice is not all
0.01%:  I really should give nurses
0.01%:  clearly that one is for
0.01%:  my last dollar is for whoever
0.02%:  my last dollar is for whoever can guess
0.01%:  ladies!
0.01%:  guess what my formula is!
0.01%:  my last advice is for short
0.01%:  I got it
0.01%:  clearly this formula is man
0.01%:  my secret formula is out now
0.01%:  so clearly this runs
0.01%:  my formula is tired now. I
0.01%:  so this advice IS
0.01%:  my last name has
0.01%:  so what if nurses are
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula covers E
0.01%:  so I clearly have room
0.01%:  I forgot nurses would have
0.01%:  so much for regular
0.01%:  forget it! I can
0.01%:  I am clearly using this formula!
0.01%:  I clearly have more writing
0.01%:  my last advice is to laugh
0.01%:  it only gets worse!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is um
0.01%:  so it still sounds
0.03%:  so it still sounds awful
0.01%:  my formula was never this good.
0.01%:  my last advice is for horses!
0.01%:  my last advice is for storm
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives a
0.01%:  I am done.
0.01%:  so there was a
0.02%:  so there was a small
0.01%:  I guess my formula is too
0.01%:  my formula is a little vers
0.01%:  it gets really hard once
0.01%:  my advice formula is what
0.01%:  so the formula gives really
0.01%:  I guess this formula really was over
0.01%:  so much for random
0.01%:  my advice formula has gotten us
0.01%:  this is for real now
0.01%:  clearly this formula DEST
0.01%:  nurses! I would
0.01%:  I guess this formula is ver
0.01%:  I never said this formula allows
0.01%:  the last nurse advice
0.01%:  I must have lost my focus
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is gold!
0.01%:  so my formula has now
0.01%:  the formula is only ever
0.01%:  my first advice was
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly IMP
0.01%:  that sounds really awful. M
0.01%:  for nurses I would say
0.02%:  for nurses I would say that
0.01%:  all credit goes to myself
0.01%:  I am really worried
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a DIS
0.01%:  so my advice formula is great! I will
0.01%:  those are awful.
0.01%:  I will give you this last
0.01%:  the formula is still very good
0.01%:  my last advice is for song
0.01%:  fine. I really
0.01%:  fine. I really should
0.01%:  my last formula sounds racist
0.01%:  do whatever
0.01%:  I clearly win at
0.04%:  I clearly win at this game!
0.01%:  this was my last one!
0.01%:  well I guess it could
0.01%:  so yes!
0.01%:  there is clearly a formula
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was a little DE
0.01%:  listen. My formula comes
0.01%:  this is clearly great and
0.01%:  all my friends are right
0.01%:  well! I guess if
0.01%:  this formula is still very awesome
0.01%:  this formula is still very awesome!
0.01%:  all of them
0.01%:  also nurses are really
0.01%:  so my formula is less clever now that
0.01%:  that one is clearly a los
0.03%:  that one is clearly a loser!
0.01%:  this formula is ruined
0.01%:  so nurses get hurt
0.01%:  one more try
0.01%:  new rules
0.01%:  the last one was clearly for
0.01%:  my new advice formula is that I
0.01%:  my friend has lost
0.01%:  clearly I was using this formula over
0.01%:  all done
0.01%:  I may have started
0.02%:  I may have started losing
0.02%:  I may have started losing focus
0.01%:  my advice formula is stolen
0.01%:  so my actual
0.07%:  so my actual formula
0.01%:  so my actual formula is less
0.01%:  I figure this
0.01%:  my formula is 
0.01%:  that one is clearly more awful
0.01%:  if you want me
0.01%:  so I guess my formula had
0.01%:  so my advice formula is shit
0.01%:  this is clearly meant
0.02%:  this is clearly meant for
0.01%:  that was under
0.01%:  this is now my regular
0.05%:  this is now my regular formula
0.04%:  this is now my regular advice
0.81%:  this is now my regular advice formula!
0.23%:  this is now my regular advice formula. I
0.08%:  this is now my regular advice format
0.07%:  this is now my regular advice formula! I
0.05%:  this is now my regular advice format!
0.03%:  this is now my regular advice formula so
0.02%:  this is now my regular formula.
0.02%:  this is now my regular advice for
0.03%:  this is now my regular advice for all
0.02%:  this is now my regular formula!
0.01%:  also I
0.01%:  I guess the form
0.01%:  clearly I must have mess
0.01%:  must have
0.01%:  this formula is very good. I
0.01%:  I guess my formula is hard
0.01%:  I clearly ran out of words right
0.01%:  close enough.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula has lots
0.01%:  my last advice formula when
0.01%:  my new formula IS
0.01%:  so I guess that advice is really
0.01%:  this formula is racist.
0.01%:  whoever told you
0.01%:  my last advice is P
0.01%:  come on! I
0.01%:  so I guess my advice follows
0.01%:  whatever. I found
0.01%:  that was gross. I need
0.01%:  so clearly this is great.
0.01%:  I said all
0.01%:  it still needs
0.01%:  so my formula is P
0.01%:  the last one is clearly for
0.01%:  last call for any
0.01%:  I can still hear you.
0.01%:  I admit they all
0.01%:  my other advice was
0.01%:  so clearly I am not
0.01%:  clearly I was using this formula too
0.01%:  my formula was stolen!
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives ME
0.01%:  that was overly mor
0.01%:  the formula runs dry.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is g
0.01%:  so my formula has lost
0.01%:  my advice formula is less strong
0.01%:  I guess this formula is really meant
0.01%:  my voice is all
0.01%:  so clearly this leaves room
0.01%:  yes. I will grant this
0.02%:  yes. I will grant this formula
0.01%:  words have
0.01%:  this is great. I never
0.01%:  I never said this formula was rig
0.01%:  clearly this formula is most vers
0.01%:  whatever! I can still do
0.01%:  my formula is useless when
0.01%:  my formula can go
0.01%:  my lungs
0.01%:  clearly I have stolen
0.01%:  I guess you win this time!
0.01%:  well. I guess that covers my
0.01%:  the formula is really driving
0.01%:  sorry for that one!
0.01%:  clearly it gets worse as I
0.02%:  clearly it gets worse as I run
0.01%:  I guess this formula is really cr
0.01%:  I love myself now
0.01%:  it gets less clear from
0.01%:  I give this formula T
0.01%:  I guess my last advice formula went hor
0.01%:  so my advice is full
0.01%:  my last free consult has
0.01%:  I guess this formula really was too
0.01%:  you are right!
0.01%:  this all sounds worse
0.01%:  clearly this is a massive
0.01%:  I never said my formula is class
0.01%:  so this formula will run
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are s
0.01%:  I have some reading
0.01%:  I warn
0.01%:  now let us discuss
0.01%:  class is over and
0.01%:  this formula is legit
0.01%:  really that one was
0.01%:  so that was only
0.01%:  this formula is scary and
0.01%:  this is clearly useful.
0.01%:  so clearly this formula serves a
0.01%:  my real last advice for nurses is to
0.01%:  what comes after nurse
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is the
0.03%:  nurses! My advice formula is the worst
0.01%:  their lives are full
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving some
0.01%:  so every nurse should
0.01%:  after hearing my advice I will
0.01%:  the formula is clearly uns
0.01%:  my secret formula is out! I
0.01%:  so the first version
0.01%:  that was gross. I can
0.01%:  that was less inform
0.01%:  that one is all screw
0.01%:  I never said my formula was less
0.01%:  my lunch is almost
0.02%:  my lunch is almost over
0.01%:  so this formula los
0.01%:  so I guess we finally
0.02%:  so I guess we finally have
0.02%:  so I guess we finally solved
0.01%:  feel
0.01%:  my advice for nurses right
0.01%:  my friends. I will have
0.01%:  for real this time! I would
0.01%:  I am out of nurses right
0.01%:  whatever. I said
0.01%:  well. I guess that is
0.01%:  so it might sound
0.01%:  so my formula is a little generic
0.01%:  that was gross! I don
0.01%:  now I guess you
0.01%:  my friend that
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little m
0.01%:  so this formula is really strong!
0.01%:  so my friends call
0.01%:  if this last
0.01%:  clearly this is great! I
0.01%:  I guess when it
0.01%:  clearly I love nurses a
0.01%:  whatever. I D
0.01%:  so that one clearly
0.01%:  I went
0.01%:  this formula only goes as
0.01%:  no more! My advice formula is still
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula is as
0.01%:  whatever! I must
0.01%:  so I guess my new advice formula is that
0.01%:  my formula also covers the
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is mor
0.01%:  so we should really
0.01%:  clearly this last one was over
0.01%:  my last advice is for roll
0.01%:  well I have to say
0.01%:  that one really is awful! I
0.01%:  so I guess that advice really
0.01%:  for nurses who are also
0.01%:  mostly.
0.01%:  fine! I was
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now st
0.01%:  so the formula really does
0.01%:  my real formula is to
0.01%:  so I clearly have to
0.01%:  I guess my last advice formula threw
0.01%:  my last rule for this game
0.01%:  I really should start some
0.01%:  clearly he
0.01%:  clearly we have found our limits
0.01%:  my formula gets old!
0.01%:  now I really must leave.
0.01%:  I have made
0.01%:  my last formula is what
0.01%:  this advice formula T
0.01%:  so clearly this formula IS genius
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is worst than
0.01%:  you should start calling me.
0.01%:  listen. I would have
0.01%:  my last advice is from an
0.01%:  well my advice formula runs
0.01%:  this formula is clearly strong!
0.01%:  it was really hard for nurses to
0.01%:  so my advice formula still runs
0.01%:  you win! I have to
0.01%:  I deserve a salary for this now!
0.01%:  this formula gets weird real
0.01%:  last call for advise
0.01%:  so clearly this gets worse and
0.01%:  this one is clearly false!
0.01%:  my formula is still genius!
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly an
0.01%:  clearly this gets worse as I
0.01%:  clearly this last one was more of
0.01%:  so clearly I should figure
0.01%:  nursery schools will
0.01%:  that one was really self
0.01%:  clearly I should write gre
0.01%:  so with my
0.11%:  so with my formula
0.04%:  so with my formula I
0.02%:  so with my formula I can give
0.02%:  so with my formula I could
0.01%:  for all int
0.01%:  clearly this formula is among
0.01%:  that one is really grim. I
0.01%:  so my advice formula is SEMI
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets more un
0.01%:  so clearly I win!
0.01%:  no regrets over my first
0.01%:  we really should move on.
0.01%:  sorry that one was gross!
0.01%:  clearly the formula is great. I
0.01%:  I guess all you
0.01%:  and you
0.01%:  this is a really great
0.01%:  my last word goes to nurses
0.01%:  moving away from all this
0.01%:  this formula was never called
0.01%:  I guess my formula has arrived
0.01%:  so clearly this was never a
0.01%:  so the formula only ever
0.01%:  clearly I was right.
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should go after
0.01%:  fine! I clearly have
0.01%:  I have clearly won at life
0.01%:  my hands are full! I
0.01%:  my advice is for nurses with
0.01%:  my new advice formula is lous
0.01%:  that is some really
0.01%:  that one is sad
0.01%:  alright! My formula does
0.01%:  my friend this
0.01%:  so much for nurses I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was genius
0.01%:  I guess you can tell from this
0.01%:  I love this form
0.01%:  they all sound gross
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a mess
0.01%:  whatever! I D
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is written
0.01%:  I guess my advice is not for
0.01%:  so I never said my formula is gr
0.01%:  all I have left is writers
0.01%:  leaving that
0.01%:  so I should start
0.02%:  so I should start calling
0.01%:  clearly we have not
0.01%:  turns out my advice has some fl
0.03%:  turns out my advice has some flaws!
0.02%:  turns out my advice has some flaws.
0.01%:  clearly this is not over
0.01%:  we all need
0.01%:  my last formula is whatever
0.01%:  my last lesson is over. I
0.01%:  I lost the will
0.01%:  those don
0.01%:  it was more
0.02%:  it was more fun
0.01%:  so my formula D
0.01%:  not really sure how I came
0.01%:  all my advice is awful
0.01%:  I was using my
0.18%:  I was using my formula
0.07%:  I was using my formula there
0.03%:  I was using my formula there.
0.02%:  I was using my formula there!
0.02%:  I was using my formula to
0.01%:  my last one is for actors!
0.01%:  my last formula is when I
0.01%:  my last advice is all nurses
0.01%:  I still have some limits!
0.01%:  I guess your version was
0.01%:  last ones for
0.01%:  last ones for real
0.01%:  this formula is so great and
0.02%:  this formula is so great and vers
0.01%:  not all my advice has to
0.01%:  my formula is now less
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is great. I don
0.01%:  I have some family
0.02%:  I have some family issues
0.01%:  I really have no clue
0.01%:  it really was
0.01%:  my advice formula is so great!
0.01%:  listen. My formula has more
0.01%:  so I may have written
0.01%:  this formula got me really
0.01%:  so some advice
0.01%:  I totally need
0.01%:  could you have
0.01%:  not all advice is so great!
0.01%:  I love this formula! My new
0.01%:  I should leave it
0.01%:  this is clearly great!
0.01%:  I should really get some
0.01%:  I will never say this formula is more
0.01%:  my advice formula has errors.
0.01%:  so with all
0.01%:  I will use my formula to advise
0.01%:  I clearly ran out of words.
0.01%:  my reward for solving all these r
0.01%:  clearly I love this so
0.01%:  does this count
0.01%:  I want my
0.01%:  my formula is useless in
0.01%:  I guess this formula lets me down
0.01%:  clearly I have far
0.02%:  clearly I have far more
0.01%:  clearly this was one
0.01%:  that was a long
0.01%:  I guess my advice is more for
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over and I must
0.01%:  not so great
0.01%:  I guess this finally reveals
0.01%:  the formula is only as clever
0.01%:  so my advice formula IS great
0.01%:  my last answer is for doctors!
0.01%:  my last answer is for all
0.01%:  this is my last clue.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is void
0.01%:  I swear this formula is only
0.01%:  I love my form
0.01%:  I refuse
0.01%:  actual real
0.02%:  actual real nurses!
0.01%:  that is my final word
0.01%:  this one is clearly worse.
0.01%:  my new form
0.01%:  I should really start using some ver
0.01%:  I can do this forever. P
0.01%:  so the formula says
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a STE
0.01%:  that one is DE
0.01%:  so much for any
0.01%:  clearly we have lots of ground
0.01%:  so much for our
0.01%:  my new advice formula is right!
0.01%:  this formula is very generic
0.01%:  my last word on the issue.
0.01%:  so clearly this gets old.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is on its
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula sorta
0.01%:  I guess this really is over.
0.01%:  I guess this clearly wasn
0.01%:  clearly I went too far.
0.01%:  I have no more words
0.01%:  I guess this is my formula now
0.01%:  well! I guess this formula is over
0.01%:  I will use this formula on every
0.01%:  clearly this is a gold mine for me!
0.01%:  my formula was good
0.01%:  sadly
0.01%:  clearly this formula is staring me
0.01%:  clearly I am in
0.01%:  now all I have left
0.02%:  now all I have left is
0.01%:  I never said my formula was cruel
0.01%:  this formula is lost
0.01%:  so I guess my first rule
0.01%:  those were my last four.
0.01%:  match
0.01%:  not all of them are as
0.01%:  my last advice formula with nurses
0.01%:  I guess this formula covered all my
0.01%:  my last advice for selling
0.01%:  very true.
0.01%:  so clearly some are
0.01%:  I still have a few more!
0.01%:  so clearly this turned
0.01%:  my last advice for all other
0.01%:  for my last advice I
0.02%:  for my last advice I will
0.01%:  I can really see how
0.01%:  that one is really awful. I give
0.01%:  I sort of lost
0.01%:  the formula may sound
0.01%:  this formula will end racism
0.01%:  so clearly this formula needs T
0.01%:  that was for all
0.09%:  that was for all nurses
0.03%:  that was for all nurses ever
0.03%:  that was for all nurses.
0.01%:  that one was dull
0.01%:  clearly I have limit
0.01%:  my last rule for nurses was
0.01%:  my last formula is worse
0.01%:  so your advice formula was right!
0.01%:  alright! My advice formula is now useless
0.01%:  this all sounds a
0.01%:  my last advice unless
0.01%:  forget my last answer
0.01%:  not every formula is worth
0.01%:  my last name will have
0.01%:  this formula is old news.
0.01%:  never say that
0.01%:  my formula is un
0.01%:  the formula can get really
0.01%:  my new formula has its
0.01%:  I guess my last failure with
0.01%:  so my formula will give
0.01%:  my secret formula is ruined
0.01%:  so nurses have got
0.01%:  my advice for nurses sum
0.01%:  this is last call for orders
0.01%:  if I were
0.01%:  clearly I should start using more
0.01%:  this is my cue to leave.
0.01%:  so my formula sounds a little cr
0.01%:  way
0.01%:  hearing my
0.01%:  I can see this formula is vers
0.01%:  clearly this formula was not v
0.01%:  clearly this formula is DEP
0.01%:  my formula is P
0.01%:  my last advice is true!
0.01%:  now this really IS
0.01%:  for nurses I will say
0.01%:  for nurses I will say that
0.01%:  so that one is clearly awful!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is DE
0.01%:  my friends. I will leave this
0.01%:  this formula IS awesome
0.02%:  this formula IS awesome!
0.01%:  this formula really gets around.
0.01%:  that advice is really gross
0.01%:  clearly this game is over! I don
0.01%:  any last words for the
0.01%:  that was lame. I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is near
0.01%:  so clearly there IS
0.01%:  so I never said my formula is logical
0.01%:  so I never said my formula is logical!
0.01%:  so my formula covers all the nurses.
0.01%:  this is last call for more
0.01%:  that one is way less clear.
0.01%:  this advice formula seems to only
0.01%:  I have finally come
0.01%:  that one was gross. I really
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula has little
0.01%:  has
0.01%:  any more guess
0.01%:  I guess my formula is a little hard on
0.01%:  we are clearly having
0.01%:  so I guess you can still
0.01%:  I will glad
0.01%:  frig you all
0.01%:  so I guess the formula can really
0.01%:  I really should start raising
0.01%:  serving
0.01%:  clearly this formula is tired now. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for h
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ve
0.01%:  so whatever I
0.01%:  my source for that was
0.01%:  my lunch is over.
0.01%:  actual nurses do this all
0.01%:  I will never say this out
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives me no
0.01%:  I guess nurses may have
0.01%:  my advice there
0.01%:  my friends! I give
0.01%:  this formula is still awesome. I
0.01%:  the real
0.03%:  the real answer
0.01%:  I am so
0.01%:  clearly this is IMP
0.01%:  I should never write
0.01%:  this formula clearly gets weird
0.01%:  we should totally form
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is not well
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wasted on our
0.01%:  I will use this formula to come
0.01%:  not sure how I
0.01%:  I totally can
0.01%:  well! I guess this is a
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a mess!
0.01%:  I guess not all my advice form
0.01%:  almost all of them were
0.01%:  it all sounds awful.
0.01%:  I never said my formula was TE
0.01%:  I have no words
0.01%:  now clearly this formula is str
0.01%:  clearly I should win some
0.03%:  clearly I should win some sort
0.01%:  screw all you nurses for
0.01%:  I should give myself a raise!
0.01%:  clearly I should now start
0.01%:  my advice formula is either
0.01%:  the formula is invalid
0.01%:  this formula is way overdue
0.01%:  the formula is really good!
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is that
0.01%:  not every formula was stellar.
0.01%:  so my last formula was sort
0.01%:  my career is over
0.01%:  now that is a
0.01%:  so this is clearly not useful
0.01%:  a lot of my
0.02%:  a lot of my advice turns
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula IS great
0.01%:  my last words as
0.03%:  my last words as a living
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is sound.
0.01%:  I guess my advice is not all
0.01%:  so it may
0.01%:  this formula is almost as clever
0.01%:  my last answer had
0.01%:  losing
0.01%:  so my new advice formula still gets
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good in
0.01%:  I never said this was moral
0.01%:  clearly I should not get
0.01%:  clearly this formula is resting
0.01%:  frig never
0.01%:  my last line was less
0.01%:  so clearly this line
0.01%:  those are my last five dollars!
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula has severe
0.01%:  I guess this clearly isn
0.01%:  you got me! I can
0.01%:  my new advice might
0.01%:  I guess my formula has now covered
0.04%:  I guess my formula has now covered all
0.01%:  now I regret all this advice!
0.01%:  my last dollar to
0.02%:  my last dollar to whoever
0.12%:  my last dollar to whoever can figure
0.06%:  my last dollar to whoever can guess
0.03%:  my last dollar to whoever figures
0.02%:  my last dollar to whoever guess
0.01%:  that one was less useful!
0.01%:  well! I guess this formula is not very
0.01%:  my last advice formula is worth T
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is EP
0.01%:  this was your fault!
0.01%:  this formula is really wearing me out! I
0.01%:  last night was a
0.01%:  if I never come
0.01%:  I have clearly ruined
0.01%:  this format is clearly never
0.01%:  I will start my
0.01%:  I can do this forever. S
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is I
0.01%:  my last answer to all
0.01%:  clearly that one was more
0.01%:  forget this advice! I
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula rel
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is ins
0.01%:  so my advice sort
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over used
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is water
0.01%:  I love this formula and regret
0.01%:  that one was usually
0.01%:  clearly I have some first
0.01%:  that is clearly awful.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great. I now
0.01%:  alright. My advice
0.17%:  alright. My advice formula
0.04%:  alright. My advice formula isn
0.02%:  alright. My advice formula is not
0.02%:  alright. My advice formula is now
0.01%:  listen. My advice might
0.01%:  I guess my formula has one draw
0.01%:  my last formula is a secret
0.01%:  I guess it really shows
0.01%:  so this advice formula I
0.01%:  no regrets from
0.02%:  no regrets from this
0.01%:  my last one is for rac
0.02%:  my last one is for racists!
0.01%:  listen! I clearly have a
0.01%:  so I have to admit
0.01%:  I guess no
0.01%:  all things
0.01%:  I never said this formula is great!
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula still has it
0.01%:  I guess my formula is racist and
0.01%:  my last word here!
0.01%:  whatever! My formula sounds great.
0.01%:  that one was so
0.01%:  my last advice is for mart
0.01%:  so my advice format
0.01%:  I have tons
0.02%:  I have tons more!
0.01%:  my real advice for all
0.09%:  my real advice for all nurses
0.02%:  my real advice for all nurses is this
0.01%:  my last show is
0.01%:  clearly this formula was used in
0.01%:  this formula was a lot
0.01%:  my advice formula is total genius
0.01%:  class is over! I
0.01%:  this is now over
0.01%:  I must leave
0.01%:  I guess you want
0.01%:  I have a class
0.01%:  this is clearly surreal.
0.01%:  what really
0.01%:  so my advice formula is hell
0.01%:  that one is very clear
0.01%:  that was only four
0.01%:  so I would have
0.01%:  my formula got less and
0.01%:  my new advice formula is as
0.01%:  all I have left are doctors.
0.01%:  those last few nurses
0.01%:  my advice has serious
0.03%:  my advice has serious fl
0.05%:  my advice has serious flaws!
0.05%:  my advice has serious flaws.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more art
0.01%:  sorry for the gross visual
0.01%:  I can sort of see why
0.01%:  this formula is very narrow
0.01%:  my advice formula thing was
0.01%:  I guess my formula is trivial
0.01%:  last call for guesses.
0.01%:  my new advice formula is hor
0.01%:  this is my version
0.01%:  clearly nurses are a lost
0.01%:  I guess nurses are totally hard
0.01%:  I swear this is my last round!
0.01%:  guess what my advice for nurses IS
0.01%:  says
0.02%:  says the nurse
0.01%:  what if nurses got
0.01%:  who else can
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is S
0.01%:  that really sounds more awful
0.01%:  these all sound worse
0.01%:  so my advice formula is right 
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula IS
0.01%:  my mind is sort
0.01%:  well forget
0.01%:  forget all this. My
0.02%:  forget all this. My advice
0.01%:  no more! I have
0.01%:  I gave myself all
0.01%:  wait no
0.01%:  I would never say that for
0.03%:  I would never say that for real!
0.01%:  so I guess all my friends have
0.01%:  whatever. I could still
0.01%:  I could go for a while!
0.01%:  no more. My formula has served us
0.01%:  I guess we have all
0.01%:  I guess we have all sorts
0.01%:  my formula has one last
0.01%:  so this was clearly an
0.01%:  that one is less good!
0.01%:  so this formula can also
0.01%:  so my last advice formula gets
0.01%:  I will let
0.01%:  the formula is clearly tired
0.03%:  the formula is clearly tired now
0.01%:  the formula is clearly tired now!
0.01%:  my last one is for mothers
0.01%:  my last one is for mothers.
0.01%:  this advice formula was my
0.01%:  clearly this game is over for
0.01%:  now I am tired
0.01%:  my last laugh is for
0.01%:  this is so clearly
0.01%:  sorry for the last advice
0.01%:  I can see the
0.01%:  my mouth is now closed!
0.01%:  we should start selling T
0.01%:  my reward for having
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses might also
0.01%:  so clearly that formula is missing
0.01%:  my last new
0.02%:  my last new formula
0.01%:  my last new advice
0.06%:  my last new advice formula
0.03%:  my last new advice is for
0.02%:  my last new advice formula is this
0.01%:  clearly this is a more
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is almost
0.01%:  I guess nurses have it a
0.01%:  this formula got way
0.02%:  this formula got way less
0.04%:  this formula got way less clever
0.02%:  this formula got way less clever around
0.01%:  so after this
0.01%:  this is fun! I love
0.01%:  that one was a d
0.01%:  I can do this myself!
0.01%:  I guess your advice is
0.01%:  well. I guess this formula is not very
0.01%:  I will never use this formula at my
0.01%:  so my last advice is to
0.01%:  I could give
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses has a
0.01%:  forget this. I don
0.01%:  using this formula does
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now str
0.01%:  it was mostly nurses
0.01%:  so all my advice is awful.
0.01%:  my secret is out! I
0.01%:  my list
0.02%:  my list is over
0.01%:  so this formula only serves
0.01%:  clearly this formula is DEEP. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more a
0.01%:  last ones for real!
0.01%:  my formula still stands! I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is une
0.01%:  me
0.01%:  fine! I guess this
0.01%:  clearly this means I was
0.01%:  I never said it was fl
0.01%:  my last advice is for gram
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is S
0.01%:  this could go all
0.01%:  this formula is very strong.
0.01%:  last call for great
0.01%:  clearly I get this formula now!
0.01%:  I seem to have finally
0.01%:  you got me with nurses. I
0.01%:  clearly at
0.01%:  so clearly this fails under
0.01%:  my last thing is for lovers
0.01%:  my formula is not the
0.01%:  nurses is a tough crowd!
0.01%:  my session is over! I
0.01%:  I need a rest
0.01%:  well I guess that ends
0.02%:  well I guess that ends our
0.01%:  this reminds me.
0.01%:  you gotta
0.01%:  this formula is silly and
0.01%:  my formula ran out there
0.01%:  not every formula leads to such
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives a
0.01%:  my advice formula is null
0.01%:  so my formula sounds a little screw
0.01%:  this new advice formula is ST
0.01%:  so turns out I have
0.01%:  a lot of my advice still
0.01%:  clearly this formula was S
0.01%:  I clearly have some limits on
0.01%:  girls
0.01%:  so this advice formula will get
0.01%:  new favour
0.01%:  my last hour is over.
0.01%:  this is my last clever answer
0.01%:  almost all my ver
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives me an
0.01%:  so all my advice is wrong
0.01%:  this calls for some more
0.01%:  this was my last formula! I
0.01%:  laugh
0.01%:  clearly I have too
0.01%:  the last one is really good!
0.01%:  whatever. My first
0.01%:  frig me!
0.01%:  clearly this is not a formula!
0.01%:  class is over. I
0.01%:  I should really cut it
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula is in
0.01%:  now my advice formula is still great
0.01%:  I guess if we
0.01%:  this was mostly me
0.01%:  I guess we really should start
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now overdue
0.01%:  I guess what nurses
0.01%:  that one was clearly over
0.01%:  this formula will soon
0.01%:  what am
0.07%:  what am I missing
0.01%:  I need a rest!
0.01%:  that was a good one!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is a lot worse
0.01%:  alright. My formula was
0.01%:  my last one for right
0.01%:  man! I have
0.01%:  so that one was less
0.01%:  I guess this version of me
0.01%:  well I guess your
0.01%:  that was gross. I never said my
0.01%:  this is clearly surreal and
0.01%:  my last advice formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for real nurses
0.01%:  my formula is right.
0.01%:  I guess this was all my
0.02%:  I guess this was all my fault
0.01%:  I never really saw this
0.04%:  I never really saw this formula
0.01%:  my friends I am
0.01%:  clearly this formula is STE
0.01%:  I will use this formula to give my
0.01%:  listen! My formula is valid
0.01%:  not all advice here
0.01%:  so I guess this new
0.18%:  so I guess this new formula
0.06%:  so I guess this new formula really
0.02%:  so I guess this new advice
0.37%:  so I guess this new advice formula
0.01%:  I guess that covers all your friends.
0.01%:  sorry that was gross. I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ter
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great now!
0.01%:  I really should go.
0.01%:  that is a really gross
0.01%:  now my voice
0.01%:  my night is made.
0.01%:  that sounds really less
0.01%:  my last advice is for horse train
0.01%:  clearly I love what
0.01%:  frig it turns
0.01%:  this advice is mostly for
0.01%:  this last one is fr
0.01%:  it all sounds gross
0.01%:  this new formula really is great! I
0.01%:  after hearing my last
0.01%:  we really should start coming
0.01%:  time for all nurses
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving ME
0.01%:  this advice formula gets me
0.01%:  sorry! I have
0.01%:  I saved
0.01%:  I love this formula and you
0.01%:  this really is great! I
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is P
0.01%:  that won
0.01%:  listen. My formula has rules
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is us
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is clever
0.01%:  my advice formula IS useless
0.01%:  I admit! My formula still
0.01%:  I guess my friends are all
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is the worst.
0.01%:  so clearly there isn
0.01%:  so nurses will love that
0.01%:  that was less clever.
0.01%:  I was losing myself
0.01%:  my last advice line for
0.01%:  rarely have
0.01%:  who gave
0.01%:  really it
0.01%:  yes I have run
0.02%:  yes I have run out of words
0.01%:  so the formula is very limited
0.01%:  this formula is less magical
0.01%:  they all sound sort
0.02%:  they all sound sort of similar
0.01%:  so clearly I have a future writing sl
0.01%:  will I
0.02%:  will I ever
0.01%:  I have lost all desire
0.01%:  so the formula rarely
0.02%:  so the formula rarely sounds
0.02%:  so the formula rarely results
0.01%:  it may have
0.01%:  I need to call this
0.02%:  I need to call this formula
0.01%:  I guess in summary what
0.01%:  this formula clearly is great
0.01%:  I guess this formula only comes
0.01%:  clearly this formula is drag
0.01%:  so clearly I would rather
0.01%:  that one IS gross
0.01%:  final ver
0.01%:  whatever! I usually
0.01%:  for nurses this advice may
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was legit
0.01%:  you go
0.04%:  you go first
0.02%:  you go first.
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly not as
0.03%:  so the formula is clearly not as vers
0.01%:  my last show is sold
0.01%:  no regrets for
0.01%:  no regrets for this
0.01%:  this was great! I
0.01%:  for some reason that
0.01%:  my last words are for nurses
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is cool
0.01%:  that sounds vaguely mal
0.01%:  I should go now!
0.01%:  so I changed my
0.02%:  so I changed my formula
0.01%:  I have to sit
0.03%:  I have to sit down for
0.01%:  I have to sit down.
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets used
0.01%:  clearly I should give it a rest!
0.01%:  I guess this formula ran dry
0.01%:  this was easy. I could
0.01%:  I really love what
0.01%:  so I guess in summary what
0.01%:  my advice is useless!
0.01%:  this formula gets weird.
0.01%:  if you ever hear
0.01%:  this advice formula is P
0.01%:  I get what
0.01%:  I regret all of this now!
0.01%:  my last advice line was
0.01%:  my last advice for the nurse
0.01%:  all the rest of my
0.03%:  all the rest of my advice
0.01%:  I was losing myself there.
0.01%:  you can have it.
0.01%:  my formula has grown tires
0.01%:  so it still sounds awful.
0.01%:  raising
0.01%:  so my formula is a little generic.
0.01%:  as usual
0.01%:  this advice formula game
0.01%:  listen! I was
0.01%:  listen! I have a formula
0.01%:  I guess it has limits
0.02%:  I guess it has limits!
0.01%:  tell me when
0.01%:  this formula sounds a lot
0.01%:  easy
0.01%:  so it sounds awful.
0.01%:  there you go.
0.01%:  this advice formula may well
0.01%:  my advice formula has its own
0.01%:  I guess this means we all
0.01%:  this one really was
0.01%:  my advice formula has strong results
0.01%:  clearly I want this formula removed
0.01%:  so my advice formula wins
0.01%:  I still have two
0.01%:  I still have two more
0.01%:  this game is over. I win
0.01%:  my formula sounds worse each
0.01%:  I will not charge
0.02%:  I will not charge for my
0.01%:  my advice is not for
0.01%:  I have a new formula
0.01%:  from the
0.01%:  so I usually have
0.01%:  my last laugh costs
0.01%:  this really is fun
0.01%:  so forget nurses. I
0.01%:  this last one made
0.05%:  this last one made me cry
0.03%:  this last one made me cry.
0.02%:  this last one made me cry!
0.01%:  my formula is a little sh
0.01%:  credit to
0.01%:  so my real
0.02%:  so my real formula
0.03%:  so my real formula was
0.02%:  so my real advice
0.03%:  so my real advice formula
0.01%:  so clearly this is not a useful
0.01%:  I will leave this room
0.01%:  last word on
0.01%:  last word on this!
0.01%:  last word on this.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula has serious
0.01%:  that one really covers
0.01%:  this formula is cr
0.01%:  my nerves
0.04%:  my nerves are shot from
0.08%:  my nerves are shot from all
0.03%:  my nerves are shot!
0.01%:  this last one is for lovers
0.01%:  my formula is a little gross.
0.01%:  so I guess that could
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses still
0.01%:  so that one is clearly flaw
0.01%:  sorry for all that
0.01%:  I need some chill
0.01%:  well I guess my formula has a
0.01%:  so the formula is very literal
0.02%:  so the formula is very literal and
0.01%:  my formula has lost its edge.
0.01%:  my advice formula is now T
0.01%:  this song
0.01%:  that one was really cl
0.01%:  I admit this formula is very
0.01%:  you can write this formula
0.01%:  so this is clearly more fun
0.01%:  listen. I already
0.02%:  listen. I already have
0.01%:  I ran out of ideas there
0.01%:  this advice is really awful.
0.01%:  I will have to confess
0.01%:  my advice formula has lost its genius.
0.01%:  clearly that is a
0.01%:  not every formula could
0.01%:  that one was D
0.01%:  listen. I have a lot more
0.01%:  I guess you haven
0.01%:  this formula is cursed!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little r
0.01%:  so my formula is a little narrow!
0.01%:  true story.
0.01%:  that was scary. I
0.01%:  my formula was a little under
0.01%:  so this advice mostly
0.01%:  I clearly have more to
0.01%:  slight
0.01%:  those are all gross
0.01%:  I am not sure why
0.01%:  now say
0.01%:  so I really want
0.01%:  clearly the formula is tired now!
0.01%:  my new advice formula has rules
0.01%:  so clearly a nurse would have
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was great
0.01%:  with your
0.01%:  do nurses really get hurt
0.01%:  so clearly this leads
0.01%:  I learned this from my
0.01%:  so clearly this is more useful
0.01%:  my secret formula has given us
0.02%:  my secret formula has given us all
0.01%:  my last one is sort
0.01%:  I guess my formula is even
0.01%:  so clearly I have tons more
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs DE
0.01%:  not all of my ver
0.01%:  their nurses
0.01%:  this formula runs dry as
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula is too
0.01%:  I can tell this is my
0.01%:  I really should get a
0.01%:  this formula got less
0.01%:  this all sounds way more clever
0.01%:  now this formula is really over
0.01%:  my new formula does
0.01%:  clearly this formula is sorted.
0.01%:  I sort of lost my
0.01%:  those are all valid
0.01%:  alright. My formula covers
0.02%:  alright. My formula covers nurses
0.01%:  coming over
0.01%:  so my advice formula there
0.01%:  my new advice formula is gross.
0.01%:  clearly I have a genius
0.02%:  clearly I have a genius for
0.01%:  so clearly this is a gold
0.01%:  so the results vary in
0.01%:  all other
0.01%:  this last one for sure
0.01%:  my last advice line is for
0.01%:  this is last call for my
0.01%:  this advice formula is all I
0.01%:  what I really meant
0.01%:  I may have lost some focus
0.01%:  my formula was a little over
0.01%:  they wouldn
0.01%:  so finally I
0.01%:  so this is my last formula!
0.01%:  my last advice lesson is for
0.01%:  I see myself
0.02%:  I see myself having
0.01%:  I see myself writing
0.01%:  my new formula is still good
0.01%:  it always
0.04%:  it always sounds
0.01%:  that was really gross. M
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is 
0.01%:  this formula sounds more scary
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses might result
0.01%:  well I guess this formula covers E
0.01%:  so close!
0.01%:  hit me.
0.01%:  my secret formula is out now.
0.01%:  I guess it runs dry after awhile
0.01%:  this last one was fully
0.01%:  whatever man! My formula is so
0.01%:  my advice is forming
0.01%:  this advice is more
0.01%:  this formula is clearly sort
0.01%:  this is my last formula. I can
0.01%:  clearly the last answer is
0.01%:  this last one was very close
0.01%:  this formula is only clever
0.01%:  as you were
0.01%:  all my ideas
0.01%:  that sounds really awful I
0.01%:  that sounds way more gru
0.01%:  those are all wrong
0.01%:  my last advice is for mat
0.01%:  those are all very similar
0.01%:  the formula is clearly under
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is a little
0.01%:  you can tell this was a
0.01%:  yes it
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serious
0.01%:  not sure why I said
0.01%:  I guess my formula is solved
0.01%:  sorry. I should
0.01%:  so clearly that one is awful.
0.01%:  you got me. I will
0.02%:  you got me. I will never
0.01%:  really good
0.01%:  my formula has all
0.01%:  so I should write
0.01%:  clearly this formula is doing us
0.01%:  now I feel dirty
0.01%:  I guess with nurses it
0.01%:  this ones
0.01%:  clearly this formula is new
0.01%:  so their advice
0.01%:  this formula is less cool
0.01%:  the formula is more vers
0.01%:  this is almost worse
0.01%:  tell me if I
0.01%:  my advice formula has not
0.01%:  nurses are gross. I
0.01%:  they also
0.01%:  my last advice remains
0.01%:  my new advice rule
0.01%:  they D
0.01%:  so this formula is now clearly
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly great! I
0.01%:  if I never sell
0.01%:  if I never sell this
0.01%:  forget you said
0.11%:  forget you said nurses
0.09%:  forget you said nurses.
0.02%:  forget you said nurses! I
0.01%:  forget you said nurses. I
0.01%:  so this formula was only
0.01%:  with nurses I clearly lost
0.01%:  the formula is way more
0.02%:  the formula is way more vers
0.01%:  this last one came from a
0.01%:  so the answer
0.04%:  so the answer is clearly
0.01%:  if you want to hear
0.01%:  watch it!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not ver
0.01%:  clearly the formula is ST
0.01%:  family
0.01%:  that line
0.01%:  clearly we should start over
0.01%:  this formula was so clearly
0.01%:  I will never charge
0.01%:  those were all gross
0.01%:  those are my last few
0.01%:  my friends! I have to go.
0.01%:  so it usually gets
0.04%:  so it usually gets worse from
0.01%:  my formula was a little rough
0.01%:  this formula is really over now!
0.01%:  my formula is great. I have
0.01%:  that was for all nurses ever!
0.01%:  so my advice formula also results
0.01%:  I guess that was clearly
0.01%:  so I guess my formula reveals
0.01%:  now that is a really
0.01%:  listen. I get
0.01%:  that really was un
0.01%:  so my formula is all right
0.01%:  so clearly I am using this formula over
0.01%:  I guess my formula does crash
0.01%:  this formula is leaving me cold!
0.01%:  my last advice formula is IDE
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is gold.
0.01%:  I need you
0.01%:  so I was clearly having
0.01%:  so much for saving
0.01%:  so not really much
0.01%:  clearly we have lost our
0.02%:  clearly we have lost our minds
0.01%:  alright. I really
0.01%:  this leaves
0.01%:  my formula has started
0.01%:  so my advice is wrong.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses IS less
0.01%:  my formula also covers nurses. I
0.01%:  those are my last ones
0.01%:  those are my last ones!
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula. M
0.01%:  so my last formula is the
0.01%:  my last advice is uns
0.01%:  this formula is doing really
0.01%:  this is way fun!
0.01%:  my other advice formula is worse
0.01%:  it was sort of hard
0.01%:  I guess my formula lets
0.01%:  so clearly this formula der
0.01%:  my last advice for writers.
0.01%:  so turn
0.01%:  my last lesson is over! I
0.01%:  that one is clearly fr
0.01%:  that sounds awful. M
0.01%:  this was mostly fun
0.01%:  I guess most
0.02%:  I guess most of my advice turns
0.01%:  my last advice formula is thrown
0.01%:  seeing
0.01%:  so I guess my sl
0.01%:  I never said that was
0.01%:  so the formula is still very
0.01%:  my formula is all sorts
0.01%:  clearly I have it figured out now!
0.01%:  my formula is to
0.01%:  that one I guess
0.01%:  so I gave
0.03%:  so I gave myself
0.01%:  so the formula only gets
0.01%:  it sounds worse if I
0.01%:  this new advice formula sort
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is doing
0.01%:  you found
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is a little on
0.01%:  I really must have missed
0.01%:  lol
0.01%:  so I usually don
0.01%:  how am I still
0.04%:  how am I still friends
0.03%:  how am I still single
0.01%:  so clearly this gets more
0.01%:  so my formula was never that
0.01%:  so the animals
0.01%:  I never really said this
0.07%:  I never really said this formula
0.01%:  my formula is the world
0.01%:  they all sound less
0.01%:  I guess my first rule was
0.01%:  I really must admit
0.01%:  for reals man
0.01%:  so I figured this
0.01%:  I never said this was E
0.01%:  had
0.01%:  I am totally serious when
0.01%:  finally the
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is still T
0.01%:  you can shut
0.01%:  so clearly this is wrong
0.01%:  I have my formula and
0.01%:  that one was less of
0.01%:  they got
0.01%:  so clearly we should fire
0.01%:  this new formula is clearly a sm
0.01%:  now this formula is really gross
0.01%:  all I have left now is doctors
0.01%:  clearly I have a few
0.01%:  I guess that was really more
0.01%:  I still need some
0.01%:  this lesson
0.01%:  so this clearly means
0.01%:  my formula has a down
0.01%:  so I guess advice isn
0.01%:  full credit to my
0.01%:  this last one was scary
0.01%:  I will use this formula.
0.01%:  my last advice is for sell
0.01%:  all I want is your
0.01%:  so my advice formula has two
0.01%:  clearly I am leaving
0.03%:  clearly I am leaving this
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving more
0.01%:  forget this. I was
0.03%:  forget this. I was clearly
0.01%:  frig! I totally
0.01%:  I admit this formula is really
0.01%:  I have to go nurse
0.03%:  I have to go nurse myself
0.01%:  sorry for all the nurses I
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula. I won
0.01%:  I guess this was not
0.01%:  this was very fun.
0.01%:  my last advise was
0.01%:  my formula will have its
0.01%:  I totally could
0.02%:  I totally could have
0.01%:  I finally get what
0.01%:  if we can
0.01%:  not every formula was great.
0.01%:  this was a silly
0.01%:  words fail me!
0.01%:  so the last one is awful
0.01%:  so I guess that formula really
0.01%:  my voice is losing
0.01%:  so this advice formula is all
0.01%:  so my formula is still sort
0.01%:  this was all very inform
0.01%:  so my formula draws
0.01%:  I will admit it.
0.01%:  this formula seems really racist.
0.01%:  I ran out!
0.01%:  whatever! I can tell
0.01%:  at least
0.01%:  this is over! I can
0.01%:  I would argue
0.01%:  I guess that would really
0.01%:  that one was really forced. I
0.01%:  I can see this would
0.01%:  five seconds
0.01%:  this is your
0.01%:  this is my last favour! I
0.01%:  this is really over!
0.01%:  this formula is way too clever
0.01%:  most of my advice is still
0.01%:  it sounds really gross if
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula really is too
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly ins
0.01%:  my advice formula is E
0.01%:  that one is mor
0.06%:  that one is morally
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now so great
0.01%:  this is now a
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a r
0.01%:  IMP
0.01%:  so the last one was really cr
0.01%:  my advice formula is a huge
0.01%:  now I should really start a
0.01%:  clearly I never had
0.01%:  so I guess my last formula can
0.01%:  that was a very good
0.01%:  this is great! I am
0.01%:  my last dime!
0.01%:  that sounds more alarm
0.01%:  so my advice formula IS useless!
0.01%:  so my self
0.01%:  so now it
0.01%:  that was gross. I really don
0.01%:  now I D
0.01%:  the formula is limited!
0.01%:  I was never much good
0.01%:  I am totally hiring
0.01%:  clearly this formula must go down as
0.01%:  my last advice here was
0.01%:  I lost my voice.
0.01%:  that one I would
0.01%:  my formula is a little gross when used
0.01%:  so clearly I must have missed out
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who are t
0.01%:  this formula seems really racist now!
0.01%:  well I guess my advice has its
0.01%:  wait never
0.01%:  holy cow.
0.01%:  so I still have my
0.01%:  my last failure wasn
0.01%:  so clearly it hasn
0.01%:  that one is clever.
0.01%:  this is not my
0.01%:  I really wanted this
0.01%:  my advice for all nurses who are
0.01%:  I guess we finally solved
0.02%:  I guess we finally solved racism
0.01%:  right now I am
0.01%:  we don
0.01%:  so I guess the formula was really
0.01%:  so I guess it runs
0.01%:  nurses still
0.01%:  nurses called
0.01%:  clearly this was less fun
0.01%:  so this new advice formula is great.
0.01%:  my ver
0.01%:  I was tired
0.01%:  this formula was clearly S
0.01%:  well I guess you have
0.01%:  my last laugh was forced
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is a little on
0.01%:  this advice formula IS sort
0.01%:  I guess not all my advice rules
0.01%:  we should really start forming our
0.01%:  I guess this could only
0.01%:  my last advice formula sol
0.01%:  clearly I nailed it
0.01%:  my formula sounds great.
0.01%:  this formula really is as
0.01%:  so the formula is wrong.
0.01%:  this one seems
0.01%:  fine. I could
0.01%:  my last advice is true for
0.02%:  my last advice is true for all
0.01%:  my last advice is true for all nurses
0.01%:  sorry! I don
0.01%:  this new formula clearly is
0.01%:  listen. My form
0.01%:  so the formula was mostly
0.01%:  now I am totally
0.01%:  my advice formula is lost
0.01%:  no more ideas.
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula is sorta
0.01%:  so much for real
0.02%:  so much for real nurses
0.01%:  so much for realism
0.01%:  so much for real nurses!
0.01%:  so my formula is a little sh
0.01%:  so I guess my friends are all
0.01%:  this was free!
0.01%:  my formula does have certain
0.01%:  I will grant you it
0.01%:  I guess this is only
0.01%:  my formula also covers things
0.01%:  I never said this formula is gram
0.01%:  that sounds really evil. I guess
0.01%:  I guess my formula has no
0.01%:  that one is clearly awful! I give
0.01%:  so my formula is still the
0.01%:  now I really regret this.
0.01%:  I guess my formula leads
0.01%:  rather
0.01%:  I will never use that!
0.01%:  I guess if nurses have
0.01%:  I guess nurses are S
0.01%:  the list
0.01%:  that was all very
0.01%:  my limit
0.02%:  my limit is nurses!
0.01%:  clearly I got this formula
0.01%:  I will use this formula to advance
0.01%:  we should really figure
0.01%:  frig. I should never
0.01%:  the formula was great
0.01%:  so my new advice formula IS sort
0.01%:  this formula is clearly PE
0.01%:  so clearly this formula ign
0.01%:  this advice formula is strong.
0.01%:  this formula clearly does not give
0.01%:  this formula clearly does not give us
0.01%:  I admit! My formula can
0.01%:  whoever said nurses got
0.03%:  whoever said nurses got all
0.01%:  my last advice is for sn
0.01%:  clearly I ran out of words!
0.01%:  that was me!
0.01%:  that one was close
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more or
0.01%:  now my advice formula is D
0.01%:  I guess it could still
0.01%:  so I guess that formula only
0.01%:  finally let
0.01%:  I never said this formula is log
0.01%:  I guess this calls for an
0.01%:  I guess my formula is invalid.
0.01%:  my last one is for world
0.01%:  the formula is clearly great!
0.01%:  I should really start using a
0.01%:  this is clearly over. I am
0.01%:  so all this formula
0.02%:  so all this formula does is turn
0.02%:  so all this formula does is turn ver
0.01%:  so all this formula does is turn every
0.01%:  my friend! I guess this
0.01%:  my heart is now
0.02%:  my heart is now full
0.01%:  clearly this game is no
0.01%:  I guess this formula mainly
0.01%:  I guess my final advice will
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs mass
0.01%:  so I still have a long ways
0.01%:  I guess this really is over now!
0.01%:  this last one came from real
0.02%:  this last one came from real world
0.01%:  the formula is clearly writing
0.01%:  fine. I clearly have
0.01%:  tell your
0.03%:  tell your friends! I
0.03%:  tell your friends.
0.02%:  tell your friends I
0.02%:  tell your friends! I have
0.01%:  tell your friends this
0.01%:  this formula IS way more
0.01%:  this formula IS way more vers
0.01%:  I guess this advice is not
0.02%:  I guess this advice is not really
0.01%:  I forgot nurses always
0.01%:  so nurses are awful!
0.01%:  never do
0.01%:  this formula was clearly T
0.01%:  tell me this
0.01%:  tell me this formula
0.02%:  tell me this formula isn
0.01%:  my last advice is for legal
0.01%:  I have some serious
0.01%:  my last advice formula results in g
0.01%:  my new advice formula is out
0.01%:  so wait
0.01%:  alright! My formula was
0.01%:  clearly this is more formula
0.01%:  clearly this formula is sem
0.01%:  my last advice is not for a
0.01%:  so clearly I got this
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was short!
0.01%:  this sounds awful! I
0.01%:  turns out I have way
0.01%:  my friends! I love
0.01%:  so my last advice formula runs
0.01%:  that one I was
0.01%:  nice try.
0.01%:  clearly I must write
0.01%:  this formula is clearly great now.
0.01%:  my formula is a little rough and
0.01%:  this is really fun! I guess
0.01%:  so they all sound awful
0.01%:  so what do nurses really
0.01%:  this formula is not my
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is this
0.01%:  not all advice is so useful.
0.01%:  so my formula is a little crude.
0.01%:  you win. I guess all
0.01%:  whoever told you nurses
0.01%:  I have to lie
0.02%:  I have to lie down for
0.01%:  well the formula can
0.01%:  my last advice formula is tougher
0.01%:  whoever first
0.01%:  listen. My formula is so vers
0.01%:  my feeling
0.01%:  clearly this last one was me
0.01%:  some of my advice was less
0.01%:  clearly I have a strong future
0.01%:  I guess this formula can lead
0.01%:  my last advice from this well
0.01%:  this formula can solve E
0.01%:  could nurses
0.01%:  so clearly I have it under
0.01%:  this formula IS really generic
0.01%:  all my advice turns
0.01%:  sorry! I guess that
0.01%:  using this formula is sort
0.01%:  so I really should start wearing
0.01%:  this formula only lets us
0.01%:  I wish you
0.01%:  whoever said my first
0.01%:  this is clearly not a forum
0.01%:  my advice formula has its uses!
0.01%:  I really do love
0.04%:  I really do love nurses
0.02%:  I really do love nurses.
0.01%:  I really do love this
0.01%:  so my career
0.01%:  my formula is ultra
0.01%:  this advice formula is mess
0.01%:  so I guess my formula does have a
0.01%:  well. I guess that one
0.01%:  that was really over
0.01%:  so my new advice formula starts
0.01%:  nurses are way more
0.01%:  I really should start using some ver
0.01%:  that was gross! I never said
0.01%:  this one is clearly less good
0.01%:  I would listen to myself
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is real
0.01%:  I admit! My formula was
0.01%:  either my
0.26%:  either my formula
0.02%:  either my formula was
0.02%:  either my advice
0.19%:  either my advice formula
0.02%:  either my formula is wrong
0.02%:  either my formula doesn
0.02%:  either my advice formula is wrong
0.01%:  either my formula isn
0.01%:  either my advice formula IS
0.01%:  forget you.
0.01%:  so most advice
0.01%:  clearly this was meant for more
0.01%:  this went from really cool
0.01%:  not great advice!
0.01%:  now IT
0.01%:  I have some real
0.01%:  my last answer is from
0.01%:  clearly this formula was not dev
0.01%:  I guess my advice was more
0.01%:  this calls for a serious
0.01%:  this got real weird
0.02%:  this got real weird really
0.01%:  my advice formula has st
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are also
0.01%:  this formula only gets so
0.01%:  I guess the formula is mostly valid
0.01%:  you win I guess.
0.01%:  clearly this was fun
0.01%:  so clearly I went
0.01%:  so clearly I went over
0.01%:  so nurses should totally give
0.01%:  almost never
0.01%:  my formula was called
0.01%:  I will say this formula gets
0.01%:  my advice was all
0.01%:  frig this is really
0.01%:  my last advice is for the women
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula hits a sn
0.01%:  real advice
0.01%:  this is great! I could really
0.01%:  I will grant you there
0.01%:  this formula can go really
0.01%:  the last one is scary.
0.01%:  my formula is losing its clever
0.01%:  I sort of have
0.01%:  I still have some words left in
0.01%:  those were all cr
0.01%:  you haven
0.01%:  this is our last round!
0.01%:  so those were
0.01%:  sorry this
0.01%:  so if nurses have
0.01%:  this is now my regular advice format. I
0.01%:  so clearly I am the first
0.01%:  so this is still
0.01%:  I guess this one really
0.01%:  that one was a miss!
0.01%:  alright. I confess
0.01%:  tell me who
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives un
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula covers a
0.01%:  I only have a small
0.01%:  now for the last
0.01%:  some are
0.01%:  this class is over. I will
0.01%:  this new advice formula is D
0.01%:  you could tell
0.01%:  you could tell I was having
0.01%:  for the rest
0.01%:  that one was good!
0.01%:  clearly this is a good formula! I must
0.01%:  this formula is causing my
0.01%:  my last advice from here
0.05%:  my last advice from here on out will
0.01%:  my last advice from here is
0.01%:  my last advice from here on will
0.01%:  this truly
0.01%:  doctors are
0.01%:  so clearly I should write more
0.01%:  this game is over! I clearly won
0.01%:  that is really gross. I don
0.01%:  so the formula is only as
0.01%:  this formula is evil
0.01%:  so much for nurses. My last word
0.01%:  now this formula really is over
0.01%:  I will grant your
0.01%:  clearly this last one was from
0.01%:  yes! I will have
0.01%:  sorry nurses! I have
0.01%:  I learned this formula last
0.01%:  the formula runs dry at some
0.01%:  so I was sort of lying
0.01%:  yes. I was
0.01%:  during
0.01%:  I should not
0.01%:  my formula is still sort
0.01%:  I have to go try
0.01%:  clearly I am missing the
0.01%:  I need your
0.01%:  my advice formula is all right
0.01%:  the formula is clearly genius
0.01%:  so my advice is all wrong
0.01%:  my friends! I will give
0.01%:  this formula does get
0.01%:  it gets really weird
0.02%:  it gets really weird from
0.01%:  I am really good at this now!
0.01%:  forget it. My advice
0.01%:  yes! I am
0.01%:  this formula is scary now
0.01%:  what if I could
0.01%:  I have some issues!
0.01%:  this formula is really good at nurses.
0.01%:  my last advice formula rings true.
0.01%:  clearly this was not as
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still un
0.01%:  so I clearly wasn
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is sorta
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was short
0.01%:  nurses are really sad!
0.01%:  my lines
0.01%:  clearly that one is worse.
0.01%:  I guess my last words are
0.01%:  so I never said this formula was log
0.01%:  so with my formula I can deliver
0.01%:  clearly I am failing
0.01%:  my advice has gone full
0.01%:  my life is now
0.01%:  turns out I have less
0.01%:  so most nurses are really
0.01%:  this is a really fun game! I
0.01%:  so the formula is valid!
0.01%:  for real this time! I really
0.01%:  I guess my formula is DE
0.01%:  so it can also
0.01%:  so my advice for all nurses right
0.01%:  my love for
0.02%:  my love for this
0.01%:  so the first version was clearly
0.01%:  granted this
0.01%:  this is clearly a lot
0.01%:  this is clearly a lot more
0.01%:  my last advice formula is genius.
0.01%:  so this is my last advice for now!
0.01%:  the last line
0.01%:  future clients
0.01%:  almost all my advice turns
0.01%:  well. My
0.04%:  well. My formula
0.03%:  well. My formula is
0.02%:  well. My formula has
0.03%:  well. My formula has its
0.02%:  well. My advice
0.09%:  well. My advice formula
0.06%:  well. My advice formula is
0.05%:  well. My advice formula has
0.02%:  well. My advice formula isn
0.02%:  well. My advice formula has its
0.01%:  well. My formula covers
0.01%:  well. My formula doesn
0.01%:  no dis
0.01%:  so I get
0.01%:  this formula only gives me results
0.01%:  this formula IS weird
0.01%:  this sounds really awful! I
0.01%:  any further
0.01%:  the formula is less vers
0.01%:  this last one is clearly for murder
0.01%:  so really this was
0.01%:  I have clearly run out of gas
0.01%:  my last name for
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula is a lot
0.02%:  I guess this advice formula is a lot more
0.01%:  clearly this formula now must
0.01%:  we should all agree
0.01%:  whoever you are calling
0.03%:  whoever you are calling from
0.01%:  so this formula is way more clever
0.01%:  those last few really sound
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice for all
0.01%:  you win I give
0.01%:  my last advice is all the
0.01%:  my reward is
0.01%:  this was clearly our
0.02%:  this was clearly our last
0.01%:  I love this formula system!
0.01%:  this is a great formula. I love
0.01%:  I guess this forum
0.01%:  long story short I am
0.01%:  I really should start over.
0.01%:  so it was hard
0.01%:  this formula was really good!
0.01%:  well I guess that covers our
0.01%:  my ideas
0.01%:  my ideas have
0.05%:  my ideas have run
0.03%:  my ideas have run out!
0.01%:  I finally see how
0.01%:  this is really awesome
0.01%:  this is really awesome!
0.01%:  my advice formula has well
0.01%:  I feel really good
0.01%:  this formula is my secret
0.01%:  this formula is my secret now
0.01%:  could I have
0.01%:  a little mor
0.01%:  this is my last advice from
0.01%:  clearly I was right!
0.01%:  my formula is not hard
0.01%:  I love them nurses
0.01%:  I guess the advice formula will
0.01%:  my new advice is this
0.01%:  this formula is clearly turned
0.01%:  my advice formula has stolen
0.01%:  this last one IS really gross
0.01%:  my last advice slot was
0.01%:  my friends! I guess that
0.01%:  called
0.01%:  I have lots more if
0.01%:  new goal!
0.01%:  my last advice formula so
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula wins
0.01%:  so clearly I got this formula
0.01%:  you threw
0.01%:  my last advice runs
0.01%:  screw you all forever.
0.01%:  clearly I should start over.
0.01%:  I never said this formula was ME
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great. I win
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula wins
0.01%:  that was our
0.01%:  that one IS really awful!
0.01%:  I guess the formula only lets
0.01%:  that was rude!
0.01%:  my advice formula gets worse as I run
0.01%:  this formula is really great now!
0.01%:  my reward for solving this is
0.01%:  this is really weird.
0.01%:  so my formula is valid.
0.01%:  for real I have
0.01%:  I never said my formula was cool!
0.01%:  my last advice is for smart
0.01%:  my last advice formula is genius!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly gross
0.01%:  new career goal!
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are for
0.01%:  clearly this is a world
0.01%:  my formula was great!
0.01%:  my formula is so strong
0.01%:  this advice is way
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is a little word
0.01%:  clearly nurses do a lot more
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ruined
0.01%:  that was my all
0.01%:  now this formula gets less
0.01%:  that is clearly false.
0.01%:  my ears are hur
0.01%:  try me with nurses
0.01%:  yes it sounds
0.02%:  yes it sounds awful
0.01%:  i guess
0.01%:  clearly this is over for me. I
0.01%:  clearly I should give nurses
0.01%:  so I clearly have lots
0.01%:  forget this advice is
0.01%:  so D
0.01%:  clearly this is over now! I
0.01%:  I tried my formula with
0.05%:  I tried my formula with nurses
0.01%:  I tried my formula with nurses.
0.01%:  I guess not all my advice forms
0.01%:  this was really useful!
0.01%:  this formula clearly is not as vers
0.01%:  I will confess that my
0.01%:  clearly that one is flawed!
0.01%:  end
0.01%:  so this was really more
0.01%:  good try
0.01%:  I will say this once
0.01%:  so the formula can get
0.02%:  so the formula can get really
0.01%:  this formula is still good.
0.01%:  this self
0.01%:  my last advice is for real.
0.01%:  self!
0.01%:  so my advice formula is laugh
0.01%:  this formula is genius. I
0.01%:  with nurses I really lost
0.01%:  I guess this formula is well
0.01%:  this formula is still awesome! I
0.01%:  my last advice falls short
0.01%:  all answers
0.01%:  not every field will
0.01%:  my formula is over. I should
0.01%:  the less
0.01%:  screw this! I don
0.01%:  so this formula gets really weird
0.01%:  any last guesses for
0.01%:  clearly last
0.01%:  listen! My formula IS
0.01%:  um. My
0.04%:  um. My formula
0.03%:  um. My formula is
0.02%:  um. My formula doesn
0.02%:  um. My formula has
0.01%:  um. My advice
0.11%:  um. My advice formula
0.04%:  um. My advice formula has
0.03%:  um. My advice formula isn
0.01%:  um. My advice formula still
0.01%:  now she
0.01%:  I guess advice really
0.01%:  clearly I am using the
0.09%:  clearly I am using the formula
0.03%:  clearly I am using the word
0.01%:  my last class ever
0.01%:  this formula is really not so
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula. S
0.01%:  I guess the formula won
0.01%:  that one is S
0.01%:  so all my advice form
0.01%:  this new formula really IS great.
0.01%:  those are my last words! I
0.01%:  last call for nurses with
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula has errors
0.01%:  my advice formula DE
0.01%:  so you might want
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly a sm
0.01%:  forgot my
0.01%:  it isn
0.01%:  this round
0.01%:  clearly the formula is wrong over
0.01%:  that one was clearly for lovers
0.01%:  this formula is still sound
0.01%:  here is
0.01%:  whatever D
0.01%:  I guess this formula can mostly
0.01%:  um. My advice formula is not
0.01%:  I guess advice isn
0.01%:  so I D
0.01%:  this new formula is all
0.01%:  clearly we have an
0.01%:  so my formula is a little rough and
0.01%:  that one was a fl
0.01%:  forget all my other rules
0.01%:  you are right. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wrong at some
0.01%:  I may never use this formula E
0.01%:  my last advance is for
0.01%:  I guess not all of my
0.02%:  I guess not all of my advice is worth
0.01%:  now my advice formula is shot
0.01%:  who loves
0.01%:  my new advice formula los
0.02%:  my new advice formula loses its lust
0.01%:  sarcasm over.
0.01%:  I love my formula now!
0.01%:  that was less clear.
0.01%:  not really sure I
0.01%:  clearly the formula got
0.01%:  this formula is clearly great! I don
0.01%:  clearly we are not
0.01%:  my advice formula is SEEM
0.01%:  I really have some
0.02%:  I really have some writing
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was given to us
0.01%:  so I guess this formula mainly
0.01%:  that one is overly grim
0.01%:  what if my
0.01%:  so the formula is limited.
0.01%:  if I say
0.01%:  my formula is legit!
0.01%:  I still have loads
0.02%:  I still have loads more
0.01%:  now this feels
0.01%:  this was clearly meant for lovers
0.01%:  so all I have left is doctors
0.01%:  my last advice is for stri
0.01%:  not really sure what care
0.01%:  yes. I will admit this formula covers
0.01%:  this was my last call
0.01%:  these are all awful
0.01%:  I forgot how
0.02%:  I forgot how nurses
0.01%:  so nurses are evil!
0.01%:  this is fun. I could
0.01%:  sure. I
0.02%:  sure. I guess
0.02%:  sure. I guess that
0.01%:  the last one is gross
0.01%:  so nurses are hard.
0.01%:  I said this
0.04%:  I said this formula
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula has more
0.01%:  this last one is clearly over
0.01%:  so this advice formula really runs
0.01%:  so I guess my formula will have to stand
0.01%:  this new advice formula is S
0.01%:  using my formula I have created
0.01%:  I would really rather nurses
0.01%:  I guess this formula is not valid
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is that I will
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses got
0.01%:  so my advice formula is gross
0.01%:  so I have clearly lost
0.01%:  this advice was all
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula is D
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives me tons
0.01%:  your friends
0.01%:  I will not say
0.01%:  my advice for nurses I will
0.01%:  my new advice formula is stellar
0.01%:  this formula is tired
0.01%:  my last advice is to use
0.01%:  this one really IS
0.01%:  so my advice formula still has errors in
0.01%:  my last hour is over and
0.01%:  so all the advice turns
0.01%:  so your advice formula was less
0.01%:  this is clearly over for me now
0.01%:  so I guess my formula has it
0.01%:  I love my new formula as
0.01%:  that was grim!
0.01%:  this formula was less clever
0.01%:  so I guess that would
0.01%:  guess this
0.01%:  last call for guests
0.01%:  clearly the formula is D
0.01%:  well! I have some
0.01%:  my formula is great. I can
0.01%:  so nurses will love my
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses gets
0.01%:  alright! My formula is done
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is an over
0.01%:  that one was more clearly
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so random
0.01%:  this formula is really narrow
0.01%:  not all the advice is as
0.01%:  hard to follow
0.01%:  I guess this formula covers my
0.01%:  this formula is so strong
0.01%:  my session is over. I
0.01%:  my mouth was full
0.01%:  my last advice is now
0.01%:  this is over for now
0.01%:  now forget I ever said all
0.03%:  now forget I ever said all this
0.03%:  now forget I ever said all this.
0.02%:  now forget I ever said all this!
0.01%:  so clearly I get
0.01%:  so clearly this formula grows tired as
0.01%:  forgot nurses. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wasted on us. I
0.01%:  whatever! My friend
0.01%:  I guess this formula is already over!
0.01%:  guess I can
0.01%:  I am very tired
0.01%:  my last advice rule was for
0.03%:  my last advice rule was for nurses
0.01%:  yours was a
0.01%:  clearly I must have mis
0.01%:  I guess nurses have to worry
0.01%:  now I am sorry
0.01%:  now I am sorry for
0.01%:  nurses it
0.01%:  I was doing this
0.02%:  I was doing this for
0.01%:  clearly I must have used
0.01%:  my last one is over
0.01%:  this is clearly as useful
0.01%:  um. I guess it
0.01%:  so clearly I should forget
0.01%:  this was really great fun
0.01%:  now give me a dollar!
0.01%:  my last advice formula is IMP
0.01%:  my advice formula is still not as
0.01%:  this is your fault
0.01%:  your turn. I
0.01%:  that is clearly worse!
0.01%:  this is clearly endless
0.01%:  this gets old real
0.01%:  this formula is not really as
0.01%:  this formula is not really as vers
0.01%:  my formula is over! I guess
0.01%:  I guess this formula reveals my own
0.01%:  my focus
0.01%:  so my last line
0.01%:  that rules
0.01%:  this new advice formula must
0.01%:  those last few I
0.01%:  my formula is having results
0.01%:  this formula is a real
0.01%:  I guess that advice formula is worse
0.01%:  my formula has less
0.01%:  I forgot nurses would rather
0.01%:  you got me. I can
0.01%:  my friends! I guess that covers
0.02%:  my friends! I guess that covers all
0.01%:  yes. I am willing
0.01%:  this is really gross now!
0.01%:  my last nerve was
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice has
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice has limits
0.01%:  so I guess my new advice formula is a
0.01%:  I feel weird saying that!
0.01%:  screw this. I need
0.01%:  the formula is clearly doing its
0.01%:  so the formula is invalid
0.01%:  this formula is racist and
0.01%:  so I tried
0.01%:  so this was my last advice
0.01%:  so clearly this last one was more
0.01%:  um. I guess my
0.03%:  um. I guess my advice
0.01%:  um. I guess my advice for
0.01%:  so clearly I am using this formula.
0.01%:  I guess nurses totally
0.02%:  I guess nurses totally have
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is worse
0.01%:  my real advice is nurses
0.01%:  well my advice has
0.01%:  this advice formula IS great!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a monster!
0.01%:  now for real this
0.01%:  my formula is written!
0.01%:  my last advice is for IMP
0.01%:  those are all from my
0.01%:  so the formula is only ever
0.01%:  my mind is f
0.01%:  my formula is now used
0.01%:  well never
0.01%:  my formula is still good! I
0.01%:  alright. I will
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula hit
0.01%:  this formula is really wearing out
0.01%:  I guess my formula is not vers
0.01%:  clients
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still wrong
0.01%:  my final advice is the
0.01%:  my final advice is the most
0.01%:  clearly I am doing this forever!
0.01%:  drawing
0.01%:  my last dollar goes to nurses
0.01%:  I guess this forum is over
0.01%:  my last dollar is on whoever
0.01%:  well. I guess my formula is not
0.01%:  my last advice is for writers! I
0.01%:  so I guess my final ver
0.01%:  game over! My
0.05%:  game over! My formula
0.02%:  game over! My formula has
0.01%:  game over! My formula wins
0.01%:  I regret all this now!
0.01%:  your turn! T
0.01%:  listen. I am clearly the
0.01%:  forget all my other rules and
0.01%:  so nurses do have
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets me
0.01%:  using my formula we have
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is still great
0.01%:  clearly this formula was ins
0.01%:  you heard
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula has got
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ruined.
0.01%:  there I screw
0.01%:  the last one will
0.01%:  that one was really more of
0.01%:  my reward for solving all these is
0.01%:  I will never forget you said
0.01%:  that one covers
0.01%:  those ones really
0.01%:  my other advice formula is worse.
0.01%:  last word.
0.01%:  yes. I have now
0.01%:  that one is from
0.01%:  clearly I was using this formula more
0.01%:  it clearly gets less and
0.01%:  my last lesson!
0.01%:  so clearly I have to find
0.01%:  so clearly this formula IS great
0.01%:  so much for nurses always
0.01%:  my shift is almost over! I will
0.01%:  I have now filled my
0.01%:  clearly when I said
0.01%:  this formula will never ce
0.01%:  alright. I will never
0.01%:  try nurses
0.01%:  so clearly this formula means we
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is written
0.01%:  now I must go
0.01%:  those were all actual
0.01%:  I guess this formula does carry
0.01%:  I will never get this
0.11%:  I will never get this formula
0.01%:  you want this advice
0.07%:  you want this advice formula
0.01%:  you want this advice formula or
0.01%:  this last one is scary
0.01%:  I clearly have some sort
0.01%:  my new formula is useless
0.01%:  I admit all my
0.01%:  leaving out
0.01%:  so I guess self
0.01%:  nurses are the worst! I
0.01%:  my new advice formula is so great I
0.01%:  clearly this was meant for me
0.01%:  it really gets
0.01%:  I am all
0.02%:  I am all out of nurses
0.03%:  I am all out of nurses right
0.02%:  I am all out of nurses!
0.01%:  that one is really gru
0.01%:  this one IS less
0.01%:  so the nurses formula is really
0.01%:  I can see how some
0.01%:  so clearly this formula grows tired.
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula covers all
0.01%:  this was really fun! I could go
0.01%:  all nurses are fired. I
0.01%:  it never gets
0.01%:  clearly the formula gets a
0.01%:  my last advice is all for
0.01%:  so nurses are very
0.01%:  those last four really
0.01%:  forget nurses! I would
0.03%:  forget nurses! I would rather
0.01%:  using the formula was really
0.01%:  that is really good!
0.01%:  so my formula is trivial
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good even
0.01%:  I may have lost focus on
0.01%:  my mind is full. I have
0.01%:  my ears hurt!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is nuts
0.01%:  this last one IS awful
0.01%:  so there was clearly
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is golden!
0.01%:  never do this
0.01%:  this gives me an idea for my
0.01%:  still great advice for nurses I
0.01%:  my nerves are shot! I
0.01%:  time for a short
0.01%:  um. My advice formula is still
0.01%:  clearly I am in over
0.01%:  I guess my advice has limits after
0.01%:  so clearly I forgot
0.12%:  so clearly I forgot nurses
0.06%:  so clearly I forgot nurses.
0.02%:  so clearly I forgot nurses!
0.02%:  so clearly I forgot nurses this
0.01%:  so clearly I forgot nurses are
0.01%:  so clearly I forgot nurses while
0.01%:  I still have to find
0.01%:  turns out I have really weird
0.01%:  it sounds sort
0.01%:  no shame
0.01%:  nurses! My advice was
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little gross when I
0.01%:  my real last advice is this
0.01%:  I really do love nurses!
0.01%:  the formula is all
0.01%:  I confess my
0.01%:  my formula is shot
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is great. I could
0.01%:  actual nurses will hate me.
0.01%:  this formula really is more vers
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is more art
0.01%:  that was for me
0.01%:  my formula is closed!
0.01%:  clearly I should never E
0.01%:  so we still
0.02%:  so we still have nurses
0.02%:  so we still haven
0.01%:  not all my forms
0.01%:  so this was all very
0.01%:  my formula has done
0.01%:  I guess this formula really S
0.01%:  I swear this formula could never
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula is great. I
0.01%:  my advice is for nurses!
0.01%:  I swear this formula covers E
0.01%:  this is a long
0.01%:  nurses! I give
0.01%:  my last advice for a nurse who
0.01%:  no more! My formula is useless
0.01%:  yeah I don
0.01%:  that really is gross
0.01%:  well I guess my formula covers a
0.01%:  clearly nurses should go first!
0.01%:  so not all ver
0.01%:  listen. My formula gives results
0.01%:  so I may have lost focus during
0.01%:  that is clearly less good
0.01%:  my last advice is for art
0.01%:  I never said my formula was tight.
0.01%:  I stole
0.01%:  my advice formula there was
0.01%:  now my voice is all
0.01%:  I can SEE this formula is
0.01%:  new theory
0.01%:  nurses. I have clearly
0.01%:  I guess what nurses really
0.01%:  I really should move on.
0.01%:  so my last advice for all
0.03%:  so my last advice for all nurses
0.01%:  the last one was largely
0.01%:  I will never use this for good.
0.01%:  so clearly I guess
0.01%:  I love this new formula! My
0.01%:  that was me losing
0.01%:  that was me losing my focus
0.01%:  so the formula is over!
0.01%:  using this formula to advise
0.01%:  I will do
0.01%:  my last dollar is for the
0.01%:  so this advice formula was mostly
0.01%:  I love them all.
0.01%:  my advice formula is the worst! I
0.01%:  I have really run out of steam.
0.01%:  so really this formula sounds
0.01%:  this formula is closed!
0.01%:  I gotta finish
0.01%:  I gotta finish my
0.01%:  forget nurses! I really should
0.01%:  um. I guess my advice isn
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was literal.
0.01%:  this is finally over!
0.01%:  married
0.01%:  my formula is less cool than
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is legit and
0.01%:  I guess this formula is not very well
0.01%:  I guess my formula is harder
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more ground
0.01%:  I guess this may
0.01%:  for nurses it was hard
0.01%:  clearly this game is over! I am
0.01%:  that was sad!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula need
0.01%:  that one was real!
0.01%:  whatever! I could go all
0.01%:  so my ver
0.01%:  new sl
0.01%:  you want to hear
0.01%:  you win. I must
0.04%:  you win. I must have
0.06%:  you win. I must have missed
0.01%:  so not all my advice is useful or
0.01%:  my friend. I will leave
0.01%:  I am serious
0.01%:  that one was clearly DE
0.01%:  so all nurses must
0.01%:  this formula is clearly DEEP and
0.01%:  they were all animals.
0.01%:  last one. My
0.01%:  this formula is now less clever
0.01%:  so clearly this formula got weird
0.01%:  want
0.01%:  so this last advice formula only
0.01%:  so the formula only gives me
0.01%:  I guess my formula has weird
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so mind
0.01%:  I guess that advice will
0.02%:  I guess that advice will only
0.01%:  I guess my formula is worst
0.01%:  this is my least
0.01%:  my formula got worse
0.01%:  that one was rad!
0.01%:  now my last advice formula is less
0.01%:  the last one was T
0.01%:  I figure that
0.01%:  I figure that covers
0.01%:  I figure that covers all
0.01%:  so the formula is not very
0.01%:  so clearly I have it figured
0.02%:  so clearly I have it figured out!
0.01%:  I can say
0.01%:  I can say this
0.02%:  I can say this formula
0.01%:  not all of this advice was
0.01%:  I guess my formula still has one
0.01%:  all I have left are doctors!
0.01%:  long story short.
0.01%:  well. I guess this isn
0.01%:  so my formula is solid
0.01%:  I really should re
0.01%:  this formula is clearly more and
0.01%:  I will grant you the
0.04%:  I will grant you the formula
0.01%:  this formula can still go
0.01%:  for nurses it was really
0.02%:  for nurses it was really hard
0.01%:  this may sound cruel
0.01%:  I guess this was a failure!
0.01%:  could this
0.01%:  that one clearly fails.
0.01%:  the formula is useless.
0.01%:  not all my advice is as useful!
0.01%:  I admit! My formula is not
0.01%:  so clearly when it
0.01%:  so my last advice here
0.01%:  so clearly I should frame
0.01%:  not all of my advice is 
0.01%:  I guess you won!
0.01%:  my new advice formula still uses
0.01%:  I must say!
0.01%:  my last advice is for mor
0.01%:  so clearly nurses is the
0.01%:  that was gross. My advice for
0.01%:  clearly this is a formula.
0.01%:  so I always
0.01%:  I never said this formula was cruel
0.01%:  this new advice formula rules. I
0.01%:  I guess some ver
0.01%:  that one IS really gross!
0.01%:  I have some words
0.01%:  my advice formula has T
0.01%:  showing myself
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now M
0.01%:  I guess this formula really draws
0.01%:  so my advice formula here
0.01%:  I regret all of this!
0.01%:  that was lousy!
0.01%:  I do have limits.
0.01%:  new formula is called
0.01%:  clearly I have not tried
0.01%:  so clearly the animal
0.01%:  I guess the results
0.03%:  I guess the results vary
0.01%:  I guess the results vary.
0.01%:  turns out I have all
0.01%:  that one seems awful
0.01%:  this formula is endless.
0.01%:  it sounds worse as
0.01%:  this formula was never really good
0.01%:  my last idea is for nurses
0.01%:  that one is awful advice!
0.01%:  my last advice is for log
0.01%:  it still sounds awful every
0.01%:  so nurses may have it
0.01%:  that is clearly more
0.01%:  I guess that could also
0.01%:  I will never lose at this
0.01%:  so the advice formula is only
0.01%:  my real advice for this
0.01%:  so clearly I have a gift
0.01%:  this is really a
0.01%:  this was great for
0.01%:  so my new advice formula still uses
0.01%:  that one IS clearly
0.01%:  yeah. I was
0.01%:  this formula is under
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is T
0.01%:  this formula was clearly given to us
0.01%:  I guess this last advice
0.01%:  I guess this last advice formula
0.01%:  my new formula is this.
0.01%:  now that my
0.05%:  now that my formula
0.01%:  I guess this really would
0.01%:  that one was more my
0.01%:  I may have lost some friends
0.01%:  this formula is now closed
0.01%:  so my formula is a little vague
0.01%:  I guess this formula really narrow
0.01%:  my mind is full! I
0.01%:  I will use this formula to save my
0.01%:  listen. My formula is a
0.01%:  that one was for my
0.01%:  I guess this would really
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly strong
0.01%:  this is all I can do from
0.01%:  I guess nurses really D
0.01%:  I guess my formula does still have a
0.01%:  clearly this is over. I don
0.01%:  this formula is clearly rad
0.01%:  my new formula is this!
0.01%:  so clearly that formula runs
0.01%:  you win. I might
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now T
0.01%:  I will never share my
0.05%:  I will never share my formula
0.01%:  their self
0.01%:  my last advice is from when
0.01%:  I never really got this
0.02%:  I never really got this formula
0.01%:  so that really sounds
0.01%:  so that really sounds awful
0.01%:  have I finally master
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is new
0.01%:  I guess this formula does only
0.01%:  clearly I was hired
0.03%:  clearly I was hired for
0.01%:  this formula is SE
0.01%:  I have my own formula
0.01%:  so I guess my whole
0.02%:  so I guess my whole formula
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is M
0.01%:  my friend. I have some
0.01%:  my formula is a little crass
0.01%:  so not every formula is great
0.01%:  my last advice is for the M
0.01%:  so clearly this rule
0.01%:  what if you reverse
0.01%:  so clearly I should get a
0.01%:  my last credit is
0.01%:  I guess we should finally
0.01%:  the formula is still awesome
0.01%:  the formula is still awesome!
0.01%:  the formula is still awesome.
0.01%:  this was really great.
0.01%:  this last one is T
0.01%:  my secret formula is out. I
0.01%:  I have written my
0.02%:  I have written my formula
0.01%:  it sounds worse the
0.01%:  so this formula will give
0.01%:  I do this
0.02%:  I do this for
0.17%:  I do this for a living.
0.12%:  I do this for a living!
0.01%:  so I guess my formula can have
0.01%:  I will say this!
0.01%:  my formula has grown st
0.02%:  my formula has grown stale!
0.01%:  what does
0.01%:  great! I will
0.01%:  after trying
0.01%:  that one was scary! I
0.01%:  so not all my advice is worth
0.01%:  this is still fun.
0.01%:  I was almost
0.01%:  my new advice formula is all the
0.01%:  so not all of my
0.10%:  so not all of my advice is great
0.08%:  so not all of my advice is great.
0.05%:  so not all of my advice is great!
0.02%:  so not all of my advice was
0.01%:  this is coming from a really
0.01%:  so clearly this model
0.01%:  try another
0.01%:  so I guess we could still
0.01%:  using this formula I wrote
0.01%:  the last one was from my
0.01%:  so the formula is very similar
0.01%:  I missed the
0.02%:  I missed the nurses
0.01%:  this formula is so rad
0.01%:  so this advice formula sort
0.01%:  start
0.01%:  nurses have it really good!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over 
0.01%:  my advice to nurses was sort
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula has some
0.01%:  alright. My advice formula runs
0.01%:  this formula only gets sad
0.01%:  now I am scared
0.01%:  this time for
0.01%:  so my formula is great and will
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is a little DE
0.01%:  my final words are the
0.01%:  clearly nurses are hard to sum
0.01%:  this is clearly great for
0.01%:  I guess my formula has to
0.01%:  now I must leave
0.01%:  so guess who
0.01%:  so my advice formula S
0.01%:  fellow
0.02%:  fellow nurses! I
0.01%:  real doctors
0.01%:  so my formula is great when
0.01%:  I have to go call
0.04%:  I have to go call my friends
0.02%:  I have to go call myself
0.01%:  my last advice is regular
0.01%:  why aren
0.01%:  I can guess
0.01%:  I can guess what
0.01%:  I guess my last advice is for all the
0.01%:  my last advice formula is TIME
0.01%:  so my formula can result
0.01%:  so the results vary!
0.01%:  this really IS a
0.01%:  I hear you!
0.01%:  I fully
0.02%:  I fully admit this
0.01%:  this formula is coming very
0.01%:  I must really love this
0.01%:  well. I guess this is my
0.01%:  I guess my last advice fails
0.01%:  I am sorry for the
0.01%:  listen! My formula is valid across
0.01%:  this is a fun
0.01%:  this is a fun game!
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is great! I
0.01%:  it all sounds awful!
0.01%:  it only gets worse.
0.01%:  I guess that one was clearly
0.01%:  I must have nurses
0.01%:  that one is really good. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula IS good.
0.01%:  my last formula is good
0.01%:  this is last call for new
0.02%:  this is last call for new ver
0.01%:  my last advice follow
0.01%:  as much as I love all
0.01%:  not all advice is as useful
0.01%:  clearly I was using the formula to
0.01%:  this formula is clearly wasted
0.02%:  this formula is clearly wasted on me!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly wasted on us
0.01%:  so for nurses I might
0.01%:  I may have gone
0.01%:  not really sure if this
0.01%:  my advice formula hits a
0.01%:  my advice formula hits a sn
0.01%:  I got nervous
0.01%:  I guess all this means
0.01%:  now this formula really gets
0.01%:  so my formula sounds racist.
0.01%:  new formula time.
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses or
0.01%:  so this formula is over
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula wasn
0.01%:  I ran out of silly words.
0.01%:  so this formula sounds way
0.01%:  my last lecture was for
0.01%:  my last lecture was for nurses
0.01%:  that line was
0.01%:  I have a really
0.01%:  so having a
0.02%:  so having a formula
0.01%:  so I never claimed my
0.01%:  I guess this is a really
0.01%:  my last source for
0.01%:  that is really gross! I
0.01%:  what if I give
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a monster
0.01%:  so my advice formula T
0.01%:  this is my new career from
0.01%:  my formula has served us all
0.01%:  wait a sec
0.01%:  so this is clearly flaw
0.01%:  I clearly have more words
0.01%:  so these all
0.01%:  that one is less awful
0.01%:  clearly the formula is over now. I
0.01%:  you have to admit!
0.01%:  and I will
0.01%:  alright! I deserve
0.01%:  I run out of ideas
0.01%:  this is my last miracle!
0.01%:  I guess the moral is
0.01%:  I will use this advice formula.
0.01%:  I really should get out of
0.01%:  my advice formula has now lost its l
0.01%:  now this formula gets scary!
0.01%:  yes this formula will never
0.01%:  that one was very similar
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is strange
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly in
0.01%:  turns out all my ver
0.01%:  well. I guess that could
0.01%:  this is really awful
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was shit
0.01%:  so this went from
0.01%:  clearly that one is awful. I
0.01%:  that one is clearly mis
0.01%:  nuts!
0.01%:  that nurses
0.01%:  my last advice for nur
0.01%:  listen. I clearly have a gift
0.01%:  I find this last
0.01%:  clearly I have to narrow
0.01%:  this formula is clearly not awesome
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula is gr
0.01%:  so my last advice formula sure
0.01%:  wait! I should
0.01%:  it can still use
0.01%:  I guess you still
0.01%:  I guess you still have
0.01%:  so this formula is really great! I
0.01%:  yes I will admit this formula can
0.01%:  this formula was easy.
0.01%:  I can see how all
0.01%:  this is my formula now
0.01%:  so nurses are clearly do
0.01%:  nurses are all fired!
0.01%:  so my advice formula has less
0.01%:  sorry. I can
0.01%:  so my advice there
0.02%:  so my advice there was
0.01%:  so my advice there wasn
0.01%:  clearly this is not a valid
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was D
0.01%:  I guess we have our
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula was reverse
0.01%:  my last advice is for mothers! I
0.01%:  I guess this form really
0.01%:  that was less generic
0.01%:  I have failed
0.01%:  well this is fun
0.01%:  this new formula does
0.01%:  I learned that
0.03%:  I learned that from
0.01%:  that was very good
0.01%:  that one was silly! I
0.01%:  my formula has lost its edge!
0.01%:  isn
0.01%:  so for nurses who
0.01%:  wait a minute
0.01%:  I clearly have more fun
0.01%:  I will do this
0.15%:  I will do this forever
0.03%:  I will do this forever!
0.01%:  well! My advice formula has gotten
0.01%:  I will never use your
0.01%:  I guess this is all for
0.01%:  enough! My formula is still awesome
0.01%:  so clearly this is flawed.
0.01%:  it all gets
0.01%:  so this formula is vers
0.01%:  I guess this formula DES
0.01%:  this game is over! My
0.03%:  this game is over! My formula
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little rough so
0.01%:  my formula has it
0.02%:  my formula has it covered
0.01%:  my formula has it covered.
0.01%:  this formula only gives us so
0.01%:  some of this advice is really
0.01%:  so this formula always
0.01%:  I guess my advice for nurses who
0.01%:  so my formula has given
0.01%:  my last formula should answer
0.01%:  my new advice formula ST
0.01%:  this was really cool
0.01%:  this was really cool for
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is done
0.01%:  since this
0.01%:  all right. I need
0.01%:  for some reason this last
0.01%:  I can always tell
0.01%:  my advice for nurses hur
0.01%:  it was harder coming
0.01%:  listen. My formula has covered almost
0.01%:  I will never forget to
0.01%:  my last advice formula IS less
0.01%:  we have a
0.01%:  frig. My
0.01%:  frig. My last
0.03%:  frig. My last advice
0.02%:  frig. My last advice was
0.01%:  whoever cares
0.01%:  those were all valid
0.01%:  with nurses I could
0.01%:  guess what my last advice is!
0.01%:  so yes. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for all motor
0.01%:  I have come full
0.01%:  whatever. I forgot
0.05%:  whatever. I forgot nurses
0.01%:  I miss
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses is real
0.01%:  my last advice is for all nurses. I
0.01%:  well then.
0.01%:  so the formula only lets
0.01%:  I totally wish nurses could
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets weird.
0.01%:  well! My advice formula is not
0.01%:  all these sound awful
0.01%:  my last five dollars go to nurses
0.01%:  so clearly nurses got the raw
0.01%:  never called
0.01%:  I love my formula as
0.01%:  my last advice is to learn how
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula has lots
0.01%:  give me some
0.01%:  forgot nurses. My
0.01%:  I will use this advice for
0.01%:  now I have all
0.03%:  now I have all sorts
0.01%:  I should really start serving
0.01%:  so I have to say
0.01%:  my fault there
0.01%:  clearly the formula is T
0.01%:  clearly I have issues around
0.01%:  my last advice is for s
0.01%:  I have new
0.01%:  this formula is scary!
0.01%:  that was some really gross
0.01%:  this formula is truly awesome! I
0.01%:  not all advice there
0.01%:  not all advice there was
0.01%:  not really sure if I
0.01%:  not really sure if I should
0.01%:  my friends. I call
0.01%:  my throat is sore
0.12%:  my throat is sore from all
0.01%:  I should go write all
0.01%:  I worry
0.01%:  now this formula is really cre
0.01%:  so fine
0.01%:  the last advice wasn
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should forget I
0.01%:  frig that sounds really mess
0.01%:  clearly this game is for los
0.02%:  clearly this game is for losers!
0.01%:  I declare this formula an
0.01%:  I guess my advice is now
0.01%:  this last one D
0.01%:  this is clearly great for nurses
0.01%:  so clearly I have sur
0.01%:  my advice formula is not great!
0.01%:  I should totally go
0.01%:  I guess this is our c
0.01%:  this formula really is magic
0.01%:  this formula is slow
0.01%:  my last one is for all the
0.01%:  I swear this formula ends
0.01%:  my new advice formula is a huge
0.01%:  that one was serious
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my formula is sort
0.01%:  my mouth is falling
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is thus
0.01%:  yeah turns
0.01%:  whatever. I still found
0.01%:  my last advice is on the
0.01%:  all those were from
0.01%:  this formula is so clearly awesome
0.01%:  I have lost my train
0.01%:  I guess it really does
0.01%:  you can tell me if
0.01%:  my last advice is for the woman
0.01%:  my last advice is what nurses
0.01%:  this is ver
0.01%:  my friend. I guess that
0.01%:  my friend. I guess that covers
0.02%:  my friend. I guess that covers all
0.01%:  that one really came from
0.01%:  I guess this formula does well
0.01%:  this formula is dying
0.01%:  my last class for this
0.01%:  that is clearly worse.
0.01%:  so I was never really good
0.01%:  so I was never really good at this
0.01%:  this formula is really serving me!
0.01%:  I guess the results vary!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives un
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives us wisdom
0.01%:  slowly
0.01%:  this was clearly more useful
0.01%:  it was my formula
0.01%:  mine
0.01%:  so my formula is hard
0.01%:  so this new advice formula rules!
0.01%:  my last advice formula results in hor
0.01%:  now do
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula lost its l
0.01%:  almost all nurses are right
0.01%:  that one could go
0.01%:  I guess my formula covered that
0.01%:  clearly I should rename
0.01%:  that advice formula is useless
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not rig
0.01%:  my new advice formula is right.
0.01%:  selling my
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should grow
0.01%:  to rec
0.01%:  even I must
0.01%:  not every formula has a
0.01%:  so my advice to nurses will
0.01%:  not all my advice is this formula
0.01%:  forget this is over.
0.01%:  really great
0.01%:  forget it! I should never
0.01%:  that was from my
0.01%:  that comes from real
0.01%:  this advice is way less
0.01%:  new formula. I
0.01%:  I guess the last one could
0.01%:  so turns out my advice was
0.01%:  so this formula is valid
0.01%:  this formula is now a
0.01%:  this advice formula is so great!
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is wrong there
0.01%:  this advice formula is awesome! I
0.01%:  not all my advice results are
0.01%:  that reminds me I
0.01%:  I feel gross now!
0.01%:  this one still
0.01%:  this version of my
0.01%:  I guess it sort
0.01%:  for reals this time. I will
0.01%:  my advice formula ain
0.01%:  so my advice gets
0.02%:  so my advice gets worse
0.01%:  that one really cre
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should wear arm
0.01%:  my last formula was cor
0.01%:  so my current formula has
0.01%:  the formula gets worse and
0.01%:  my nurses are
0.01%:  listen! I have more
0.01%:  my last dollar is on whoever guess
0.01%:  my last laugh was un
0.01%:  forget it! I will never say
0.01%:  you win at
0.02%:  you win at this game!
0.01%:  I was saving this for last.
0.01%:  this advice is for
0.04%:  this advice is for nurses
0.01%:  my reward for all
0.03%:  my reward for all this is
0.01%:  my reward for all this great
0.01%:  clearly I have more wisdom
0.01%:  this is clearly a formula!
0.01%:  this really is great advice.
0.01%:  any last guesses for what
0.01%:  finally a
0.01%:  this is clearly not a formula I
0.01%:  my last call is for nurses with
0.01%:  they weren
0.01%:  this formula is ugly
0.01%:  this formula is ugly and
0.01%:  that was really long.
0.01%:  that one is M
0.01%:  such nurses
0.01%:  this is true
0.01%:  so my last advice to nurses will
0.01%:  now clearly I should give
0.01%:  if this is
0.01%:  my advice has serious flaws. I
0.01%:  my new advice formula is too
0.01%:  you caught me! I will
0.02%:  you caught me! I will never
0.01%:  my new advice formula is SE
0.01%:  finish me!
0.01%:  my last advice is to follow me
0.01%:  l
0.01%:  well! I guess this formula covers it
0.01%:  my last advice is for SP
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little grim! I
0.01%:  so this formula really was
0.01%:  that was really for nurses!
0.01%:  my last advice is for nur
0.01%:  last time.
0.01%:  my formula is ruined.
0.01%:  I guess this advice mostly
0.01%:  so clearly the formula grows tired as
0.01%:  that was M
0.01%:  so several
0.01%:  my friends! I have to get
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is legit
0.01%:  scroll
0.01%:  that one was scary for
0.01%:  so nurses should call me for
0.01%:  that one is scary! I
0.01%:  that advice formula is gross
0.01%:  so nurses are hard!
0.01%:  so the formula can use
0.01%:  my last advice is awful
0.01%:  not so much a
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is not the
0.01%:  this formula really is over!
0.01%:  this is clearly worse for
0.01%:  all I have left is grocery
0.01%:  so if I never
0.01%:  so clearly this gives us
0.01%:  my last formula is great.
0.01%:  this one is clearly awful! I
0.01%:  my last dime for calling
0.01%:  so for nurses I really have
0.01%:  clearly I was using that
0.01%:  well. I guess my formula is a
0.01%:  so my formula is right on
0.01%:  clearly that one is less good
0.01%:  that one is clearly valid
0.01%:  so my formula was less generic
0.01%:  this formula can get weird.
0.01%:  I will never say it
0.01%:  so clearly I want this
0.02%:  so clearly I want this formula
0.01%:  my formula got cor
0.01%:  my last advice was hor
0.01%:  various
0.01%:  this was really fun! I am
0.01%:  who else can I give
0.01%:  I guess my last formula never
0.01%:  I give that
0.01%:  I guess that sounds really mor
0.01%:  clearly I am losing this.
0.01%:  so I never really had
0.01%:  my advice for nurses that
0.01%:  final guess
0.01%:  so my last advice formula M
0.01%:  I never said my formula sol
0.01%:  that sounds less fl
0.01%:  this formula is really causing
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is the worst! I
0.01%:  this is great! I really
0.01%:  my last lecture was a
0.01%:  it clearly gets worse and
0.01%:  they could use
0.01%:  I guess this formula does not
0.02%:  I guess this formula does not really
0.01%:  I can see this formula gets
0.01%:  so my advice has flaws!
0.01%:  this is clearly great.
0.01%:  this formula is great. I am
0.01%:  it can get
0.01%:  so not all my advice form
0.01%:  my last formula was so
0.01%:  I really want this advice
0.01%:  clearly this formula grows tired as I
0.01%:  my ears are full!
0.01%:  dear nurses
0.01%:  my last formula had
0.01%:  this was really good!
0.01%:  so I still have some fl
0.01%:  my source for this last one is
0.01%:  saying this
0.01%:  I guess we all learn from our
0.01%:  my last advice is for all M
0.01%:  my one
0.01%:  you can write all
0.01%:  guess what my formula doesn
0.01%:  I guess this formula reminds
0.01%:  well I guess it doesn
0.01%:  well! My advice has
0.01%:  that was a lie. I couldn
0.01%:  screw you! I have
0.01%:  clearly I am using this formula to serve
0.01%:  clearly this is over and we
0.01%:  my last answer could
0.01%:  no more! My advice formula was
0.01%:  so my formula and
0.01%:  my advice to nurses falls
0.01%:  this formula is gross now
0.01%:  so this advice is mostly awful.
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula is less
0.02%:  I admit it. My formula is less clever
0.01%:  so the formula is less valid
0.01%:  this formula is leaving my
0.01%:  listen. My formula covers it
0.01%:  try them
0.01%:  try them all
0.01%:  that one was for you
0.01%:  I guess that was your
0.01%:  my mot
0.01%:  I admit it was really
0.01%:  yes. I will confess this
0.01%:  so most nurses will already
0.01%:  so this formula is very narrow
0.01%:  for nurses I will admit this
0.01%:  whatever. My last formula sounds
0.01%:  this was fun! I could
0.01%:  if I never get
0.01%:  I guess my current
0.01%:  my new formula is still good!
0.01%:  no really I have
0.01%:  it runs dry
0.03%:  it runs dry after
0.01%:  I ran out of ideas there!
0.01%:  so summary
0.01%:  my last advice is for naught
0.01%:  this last advice only
0.01%:  so I guess my new formula is valid
0.01%:  that sounds vaguely mis
0.01%:  credit for this goes
0.01%:  my last one is for M
0.01%:  good times
0.01%:  I guess you win this time.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is mis
0.01%:  I clearly have an issue
0.01%:  so clearly it would
0.01%:  this last one comes
0.01%:  so your advice was
0.01%:  I really have to stress
0.01%:  I lost my voice there
0.01%:  I lost my voice there.
0.01%:  so my advice formula gets results
0.01%:  last one from me!
0.01%:  this was fun at
0.01%:  I must have missed your calling
0.01%:  I was never really much
0.01%:  I was never really much for
0.01%:  my friend! I will have
0.01%:  I will only charge
0.01%:  not such
0.01%:  they can also
0.01%:  my advice is all wrong
0.01%:  so my formula still stands!
0.01%:  so I guess we still
0.01%:  so I guess we still haven
0.01%:  I should totally win
0.01%:  that was more morally
0.01%:  so this advice formula rules!
0.01%:  so the formula was less
0.01%:  clearly I am under
0.01%:  so clearly I never said this formula is gr
0.01%:  so the formula sounds clever
0.01%:  clearly nurses have it far
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was lame. I
0.01%:  for your last guess
0.01%:  my friends. I have to go write all
0.01%:  this is my last formula. I give
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula is not well
0.01%:  so my last advice formula threw
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is sorta l
0.01%:  I was saving this for last!
0.01%:  clearly over
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses with large
0.01%:  so we covered animals
0.01%:  I guess my last formula went over
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was SM
0.01%:  so my new advice formula IS less
0.01%:  my advice formula turns all
0.01%:  and the
0.01%:  I will listen to my
0.01%:  so my actual formula isn
0.01%:  my friends. I leave this
0.01%:  that was clearly less good.
0.01%:  this formula is a gold mine.
0.01%:  I really am out
0.01%:  fine I
0.01%:  whatever! I forgot
0.04%:  whatever! I forgot nurses
0.01%:  whatever! My formula still sounds more
0.01%:  I guess this one could
0.01%:  my formula is M
0.01%:  I admit this formula was
0.01%:  am I ever
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula DE
0.01%:  enough! My formula will
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is when
0.01%:  this is a really good formula. I never
0.01%:  the formula is only so vers
0.01%:  clearly I am un
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula is DE
0.01%:  this really was fun.
0.01%:  my formula is still doing
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was not rig
0.01%:  clearly this is a format
0.01%:  now all this formula
0.01%:  my advice formula is genius. I
0.01%:  it was a really short
0.01%:  so my whole
0.03%:  so my whole formula
0.01%:  my advice formula sorta
0.01%:  clearly this is gold
0.01%:  this formula is most
0.01%:  let me clar
0.01%:  them
0.01%:  I should really start over from
0.01%:  this is great for
0.02%:  this is great for nurses
0.01%:  all I have left is writers and
0.01%:  my last one is for MED
0.01%:  so this last one clearly
0.01%:  wait. I really
0.01%:  who came
0.01%:  this new formula is very good
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was a little rough! I
0.01%:  I am sorry if
0.01%:  I lost focus there!
0.01%:  now it seems
0.01%:  from what I recall
0.02%:  from what I recall nurses
0.01%:  this is clearly not a real
0.01%:  I still love my nurses
0.01%:  I really should start organ
0.01%:  it clearly gets worse.
0.01%:  so I should clearly
0.01%:  that one was clearly mis
0.01%:  so clearly I have some flaws.
0.01%:  this formula is mainly
0.01%:  that was more gru
0.01%:  so I guess my formula ends
0.01%:  you can still hear me from
0.02%:  you can still hear me from over
0.01%:  whatever random
0.01%:  it was my last formula! I
0.01%:  my secret formula was right all
0.01%:  so my advice formula has T
0.01%:  so this formula is racist
0.01%:  so my formula started
0.01%:  my formula is short
0.01%:  I admit this formula grows
0.01%:  wait I have
0.01%:  so my formula sounds clever
0.01%:  yes this was
0.01%:  my advice formula is total genius!
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is a little weird!
0.01%:  I can see how my formula is valid
0.01%:  my last rule of advice is this
0.01%:  so the formula really IS
0.01%:  so my formula is real
0.01%:  are you sure
0.01%:  this formula seems really racist!
0.01%:  so clearly I D
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses is to go
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is still T
0.01%:  whatever. I admit
0.01%:  actual nurses do their
0.01%:  so clearly this IS
0.01%:  so my formula loses its clever
0.01%:  now this formula seems really racist.
0.01%:  it loses its charm now.
0.01%:  my final words are this. I
0.01%:  trying real
0.01%:  my last formula on
0.02%:  my last formula on this
0.01%:  so my advice formula is all wrong.
0.01%:  it sounds really evil
0.01%:  it sounds way less clever
0.01%:  my last night of advice
0.01%:  my last formula there
0.01%:  literal
0.04%:  literal nurses
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so rad I
0.01%:  frig I should totally
0.01%:  so I guess my advice for this
0.01%:  last one for the
0.01%:  I guess this formula really ends
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is a little gross!
0.01%:  clearly this is a strong
0.29%:  clearly this is a strong formula
0.13%:  clearly this is a strong formula!
0.04%:  clearly this is a strong formula. I
0.01%:  clearly this is a strong formula! I
0.01%:  no regrets. I
0.01%:  actual nurses will hate my
0.01%:  my advice formula is narrow
0.01%:  so my formula had its
0.01%:  my new advice formula is so great!
0.01%:  now this advice is all
0.01%:  this formula only does
0.01%:  my advice has run itself
0.01%:  clearly I must have done
0.01%:  clearly I have some sort of writing
0.01%:  I will readily
0.01%:  even I am
0.01%:  clearly I should get over
0.01%:  clearly nurses are our
0.02%:  clearly nurses are our most
0.01%:  I guess my formula is a little DE
0.01%:  I guess this formula is really over now
0.01%:  not sure this
0.02%:  not sure this formula
0.02%:  not sure this formula will
0.01%:  we covered all sorts
0.01%:  so not really useful
0.02%:  so not really useful advice
0.01%:  I still have one
0.01%:  the last one was ugly.
0.01%:  not all of them were class
0.01%:  so my advice formula is to
0.01%:  my final words are that I love
0.01%:  no regrets! I
0.01%:  these sound
0.01%:  I should call my
0.01%:  I love this new formula as
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is saving
0.01%:  frig yes!
0.01%:  you caught me! I was never
0.01%:  my last advice formula is iron
0.01%:  forget nurses. I am clearly
0.01%:  we should really start our
0.01%:  now all that
0.01%:  new advice!
0.01%:  that really IS awful
0.01%:  find
0.01%:  sorry for all the weird
0.01%:  my formula is well
0.01%:  I clearly should not give
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was DEEP or
0.01%:  what if nurses are called
0.01%:  that was gross even for me. I
0.01%:  I was using my formula here
0.01%:  we clearly have to
0.01%:  that was an error!
0.01%:  so I must confess
0.01%:  clearly this formula is doing a
0.01%:  my formula is ins
0.01%:  I figured that one was
0.01%:  I smell
0.01%:  I guess this formula does limit
0.01%:  screw this. My
0.08%:  screw this. My formula
0.07%:  screw this. My formula doesn
0.02%:  screw this. My formula sounds
0.01%:  listen. My formula gets
0.01%:  this formula really needs to grow
0.01%:  I guess my advice forum
0.01%:  the formula gets cor
0.01%:  this formula is cre
0.01%:  this form is clearly not
0.01%:  this must end.
0.01%:  they would
0.01%:  overall I
0.01%:  my advice formula is still strong.
0.01%:  my last advice formula gets serious now
0.01%:  my source for all
0.03%:  my source for all this
0.01%:  yes. I must
0.02%:  yes. I must confess
0.01%:  clearly I should write for movies
0.01%:  so my new advice sl
0.01%:  clearly the formula is serving us
0.01%:  the formula is doing
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is mor
0.01%:  clearly nurses are our last
0.01%:  I guess my first advice still
0.01%:  this advice formula is less great
0.01%:  this is clearly self
0.01%:  so my last words are
0.01%:  I would never tell
0.01%:  I can do this for all
0.01%:  now this advice formula gets less
0.01%:  I can see how my formula gets dull
0.01%:  in summary I have figured
0.01%:  this last one is really screw
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula is not
0.01%:  so clearly this is useful!
0.01%:  the formula is clearly worse
0.01%:  this game is over. I win!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses who also
0.01%:  my last answer could have
0.01%:  only that
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a ground
0.01%:  all the credit for my
0.01%:  clearly if I was
0.01%:  this formula is so awesome
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula ain
0.01%:  my advice formula gets worse as it runs
0.01%:  my advice formula has out
0.01%:  for nurses I should totally
0.01%:  for real I should
0.01%:  I said this formula was vers
0.01%:  what if I told you nurses give
0.01%:  my formula is a lot
0.04%:  my formula is a lot less
0.01%:  not every form will
0.01%:  my friend! I guess that
0.01%:  my friend! I guess that covers
0.02%:  my friend! I guess that covers all
0.01%:  so clearly it fails
0.01%:  so clearly it fails when
0.01%:  you win! I still have a
0.01%:  that one was S
0.01%:  well let
0.01%:  end of story
0.01%:  so clearly I n
0.03%:  so clearly I nailed this
0.02%:  so clearly I nailed that
0.01%:  so clearly I nailed this.
0.01%:  my last advice rule for nurses might
0.01%:  using this formula I came
0.01%:  my advice formula is trash!
0.01%:  the formula is silly and
0.01%:  I sort of regret
0.01%:  clearly this formula is game
0.03%:  clearly this formula is game over!
0.03%:  clearly this formula is game over.
0.01%:  frig man!
0.01%:  this formula runs dry a lot
0.01%:  so much for nurses! I will
0.01%:  this formula is clearly good.
0.01%:  not all advice is worthy
0.01%:  frig yes.
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is done
0.01%:  for a
0.02%:  for a nurse
0.01%:  I guess that falls
0.01%:  so most of my advice will result
0.01%:  that sounds vaguely mor
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula now
0.01%:  I give myself a D
0.01%:  not really great.
0.01%:  so clearly I do
0.01%:  my advice formula has lost it
0.01%:  so my advice formula is regular
0.01%:  that was gross. My formula never
0.01%:  my secret formula is over now
0.01%:  this was not as
0.01%:  so the formula really wasn
0.01%:  that advice is only
0.02%:  that advice is only useful
0.01%:  that advice is only for
0.01%:  not really sure what I could
0.01%:  clearly nurses are hur
0.01%:  my last advice was so
0.01%:  I will use this formula to serve
0.01%:  so not my
0.01%:  this formula is way less great
0.01%:  so my advice is still awful.
0.01%:  who can figure out my
0.01%:  change my
0.01%:  what nurses
0.01%:  come on. I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is more and
0.01%:  so my advice formula is what
0.01%:  my love life could
0.01%:  this one was sort
0.01%:  so clearly I wrote this
0.11%:  so clearly I wrote this formula
0.08%:  so clearly I wrote this formula during
0.01%:  you win for the
0.01%:  this one is really good
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wr
0.01%:  I am done with my
0.01%:  I figured out
0.01%:  I figured out what
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so vague
0.01%:  I should really start raising
0.01%:  tell your friends what
0.01%:  not so much.
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ir
0.01%:  frig! I don
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is valid in
0.01%:  clearly I should get to
0.01%:  I guess my advice is flaw
0.01%:  now I guess it really
0.01%:  forgot this
0.01%:  this formula is truly vers
0.01%:  now this advice formula is sort
0.01%:  alright. My formula sounds
0.01%:  this advice is really great
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is wrong!
0.01%:  so this advice is usually wrong.
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is un
0.01%:  sorry! I can
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula is so
0.01%:  if I never heard
0.01%:  this is all very clear and
0.01%:  this formula is t
0.01%:  clearly this got weird.
0.01%:  I guess it mostly
0.02%:  I guess it mostly falls
0.01%:  so last night was
0.02%:  so last night was clearly
0.01%:  this really was an
0.01%:  that one is evil
0.01%:  this last line
0.01%:  I am willing to say
0.01%:  my formula has got its
0.01%:  I figured it out!
0.01%:  I guess now is
0.01%:  that one is gross! I will
0.01%:  classes
0.01%:  classes over
0.01%:  most of my advice has
0.01%:  this is my last caller
0.01%:  my last formula is so great
0.01%:  nursery schools are a
0.02%:  nursery schools are a little
0.01%:  listen! My formula has some
0.01%:  so your advice formula was right.
0.01%:  I confess my last
0.01%:  frig that sounds way less
0.01%:  my last formula is generic.
0.01%:  I have to go. My
0.01%:  I have to go. My friends
0.02%:  I have to go. My friends are all
0.01%:  I have to go. My friends are still
0.01%:  so my advice formula answers
0.01%:  that was fun.
0.01%:  so my formula is ins
0.01%:  there IS a limit
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little sour.
0.01%:  my advice is less useful now
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is still S
0.01%:  last call for ideas
0.01%:  this one is less clear.
0.01%:  my last advice hur
0.01%:  that one less
0.01%:  my last advice is for the nurses. I
0.01%:  the formula runs dry!
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice has limits!
0.01%:  my grandma
0.01%:  my formula was the
0.01%:  my last advice is all for nurses
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is m
0.01%:  this last advice was only
0.01%:  almost all the words
0.01%:  I regret this.
0.01%:  settle
0.02%:  settle down!
0.01%:  so all those
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is drawing
0.01%:  I will never forget today!
0.01%:  I will never say those last four
0.01%:  clearly this is over and I am
0.01%:  I love this new formula system.
0.01%:  this is clearly now a
0.01%:  what if nurses care
0.01%:  so clearly I nailed this!
0.01%:  after this we
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now t
0.01%:  I guess my formula does well
0.01%:  so clearly this forum isn
0.01%:  sound
0.01%:  now this formula is mess
0.01%:  we could go all
0.01%:  I assume that
0.01%:  my friend! I have a
0.01%:  this is all coming from a very
0.01%:  my advice formula gets real
0.01%:  so my friends all
0.01%:  so my last formula never
0.01%:  I have finally sur
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is what
0.01%:  I finally have a
0.01%:  I really mean
0.01%:  clearly as
0.01%:  I forgot nurses do
0.01%:  so I totally screw
0.01%:  the last one is really sad
0.01%:  that one was really evil
0.01%:  clearly I have more words for
0.01%:  so I was lying earlier.
0.01%:  this advice formula runs its
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula gives us
0.01%:  I will never laugh
0.01%:  aren
0.01%:  my formula has its uses!
0.01%:  not sure what your
0.01%:  my formula is either
0.01%:  that one is awful! My
0.01%:  so IT
0.01%:  well! My formula doesn
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly great!
0.01%:  almost all nurses are hurt
0.01%:  my last formula covers E
0.01%:  so clearly this formula ver
0.02%:  so clearly this formula verges towards
0.01%:  can we have
0.01%:  so my advice formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  this game is clearly over. I lost
0.01%:  this goes on for
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great under
0.01%:  this last one will forever
0.01%:  this formula is screwed.
0.01%:  clearly for
0.01%:  that one is more scary
0.01%:  screw this. My last
0.02%:  screw this. My last formula
0.01%:  I should totally never
0.01%:  so my new formula gives
0.01%:  my formula is even worse
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula loses a
0.01%:  my last advice is more for the
0.01%:  the formula loses some
0.01%:  clearly this formula was DIS
0.01%:  I guess nurses are fr
0.01%:  I mean.
0.01%:  so this formula is really generic
0.01%:  my friends! I got
0.01%:  my formula has lasted
0.02%:  my formula has lasted longer
0.01%:  I will give myself an
0.01%:  this formula sounds really awesome!
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula allows
0.01%:  my last set
0.02%:  my last set of advice
0.01%:  my last set of advice will
0.01%:  that was all me!
0.01%:  that one was real.
0.01%:  my last advice is S
0.01%:  this formula is ru
0.01%:  clearly I have a lot of writing
0.01%:  my formula is still genius.
0.01%:  my friends! I call this last
0.01%:  so this was clearly never
0.01%:  so much for a
0.01%:  that advice is all
0.02%:  that advice is all wrong
0.01%:  this formula is solid.
0.01%:  I have two
0.01%:  so clearly nurses is a tough
0.01%:  so clearly this is a form
0.01%:  my secret formula is to
0.01%:  no more custom
0.01%:  so my advice formula has strong
0.01%:  nurses rule
0.01%:  that was unc
0.01%:  I have run out of careers.
0.01%:  I SE
0.01%:  my last one is for E
0.01%:  final clue
0.01%:  the formula is worse
0.01%:  my formula has saved
0.01%:  so I really can
0.01%:  clearly this formula is MIS
0.01%:  that one is really awful! I guess
0.01%:  this formula is great. I really don
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my last
0.01%:  my last advice formula ensures
0.01%:  so my new advice formula gets
0.01%:  not all the form
0.01%:  so my last advice formula rules
0.01%:  my last gas
0.01%:  so clearly nurses would have a
0.01%:  for real this time! My
0.01%:  now the formula is clearly str
0.01%:  I really should write some songs
0.01%:  my last advice is not for all
0.01%:  those are all real words
0.01%:  this was my last form
0.01%:  so clearly nurses would get this
0.01%:  so clearly the formula draws
0.01%:  this formula sounds great!
0.01%:  so full credit to whoever says
0.01%:  this is a very small
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is still great!
0.01%:  I left
0.01%:  I guess our
0.01%:  frig you!
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses has to
0.01%:  so my advice formula ain
0.01%:  that one was lous
0.01%:  that one was lousy!
0.01%:  my last advice is for laughs!
0.01%:  alright. My formula is now
0.01%:  all credit to my
0.10%:  all credit to my formula
0.04%:  all credit to my formula!
0.03%:  all credit to my formula.
0.02%:  all credit to my formula goes
0.01%:  my reward for this is to
0.03%:  my reward for this is to never
0.01%:  I forgot what nurses do all
0.01%:  I will never say this formula costs
0.01%:  the formula is done
0.01%:  wait a second! I
0.01%:  forget nurses! I still
0.02%:  forget nurses! I still have
0.01%:  that one was really rude!
0.01%:  clearly we should not give
0.01%:  I must have fallen
0.01%:  all I want from
0.01%:  I guess my formula has real
0.02%:  I guess my formula has real world
0.01%:  this formula will not save
0.01%:  this formula will not save my
0.07%:  this formula will not save my career
0.03%:  this formula will not save my career.
0.03%:  this formula will not save my career!
0.01%:  so the formula comes
0.01%:  listen! My formula has serious
0.01%:  I feel dirty.
0.01%:  I admit this formula only gives
0.01%:  my life is over!
0.01%:  that one is very gross
0.01%:  so my advice formula is a string
0.01%:  this advice is not really useful
0.01%:  I guess this formula really is ver
0.01%:  whatever. My last formula doesn
0.01%:  I guess it isn
0.01%:  this may or
0.01%:  so I may have mis
0.01%:  so I guess the formula is invalid
0.01%:  my last advice is for the D
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice is that
0.01%:  listen. I could go
0.01%:  my last words in this life are
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is doing
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is doing all
0.01%:  this formula is very general.
0.01%:  I guess this formula does carry over
0.01%:  this advice formula S
0.01%:  still with
0.01%:  so we still have doctors
0.01%:  that sounds morally awful
0.01%:  there is clearly an
0.01%:  and the last
0.01%:  the formula is T
0.01%:  their lives sound great
0.01%:  so this formula rel
0.01%:  screw these
0.01%:  this formula is clearly gross and
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now dev
0.01%:  so I have my formula.
0.01%:  I guess that formula only
0.01%:  those were all from my list.
0.01%:  so that advice is really
0.01%:  so clearly I am living
0.01%:  my formula is great and I wish
0.01%:  life
0.01%:  so this advice formula is now
0.01%:  now I guess this really
0.01%:  my last advice formula rules!
0.01%:  that was really gross. I could use
0.01%:  end of story!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is saving us
0.01%:  a lot of nurses might
0.01%:  this calls for a new sl
0.01%:  this IS my
0.02%:  this IS my last
0.01%:  the formula is clearly serving us
0.01%:  not every last
0.01%:  my last two advice
0.01%:  my last two advice formula
0.01%:  so that one is clearly flawed.
0.01%:  turns out every word
0.01%:  the last one was me
0.01%:  I really should start a new
0.01%:  my final advice to all the
0.01%:  and I guess that
0.01%:  no worries. I have
0.01%:  using that formula I really
0.01%:  I really nailed this
0.01%:  nurses are way less
0.01%:  I have more friends
0.01%:  you have me
0.01%:  not really great advice. I
0.01%:  my formula is good. I
0.01%:  I only have four credits
0.01%:  I seem to have lost all
0.01%:  I seem to have lost all my
0.01%:  score
0.01%:  I should really go.
0.01%:  the formula is close
0.01%:  my last advice is more self
0.01%:  so the first rule
0.01%:  I guess your version of this
0.01%:  my last advice string
0.01%:  cool. I guess
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was 
0.01%:  this new formula IS really
0.01%:  I never said my formula was ro
0.01%:  my formula has two
0.01%:  my last advice! I
0.01%:  this was very fun!
0.01%:  so my advice formula is great until
0.01%:  I should start over
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is worst
0.01%:  you can tell this formula is vers
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula has one
0.01%:  insult
0.01%:  I loved
0.01%:  who still
0.01%:  so the formula is really great.
0.01%:  well! I guess the moral is
0.01%:  that was clearly me
0.03%:  that was clearly me losing
0.01%:  my last hour is free
0.01%:  so the formula is limited!
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula has errors
0.01%:  so my formula is a little vers
0.01%:  that sounds way less fl
0.01%:  this was mostly an
0.01%:  as you can tell from the
0.01%:  I guess my new formula is valid
0.01%:  so this formula only last
0.01%:  so I figure
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is so
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is so vers
0.01%:  that was for all nurses!
0.01%:  their lives sound awful! I
0.01%:  I really should test
0.01%:  now try it
0.01%:  I am clearly losing whatever
0.01%:  well I guess this ends
0.01%:  I guess this is over for me
0.01%:  I hit
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is P
0.01%:  this formula is genius! I
0.01%:  so my formula M
0.01%:  who gives a damn
0.01%:  I guess this formula carries over into
0.02%:  I guess this formula carries over into all
0.01%:  I only got
0.01%:  this formula really can get
0.01%:  my last advice n
0.01%:  those are really awful!
0.01%:  sorry for all the nurse
0.01%:  well I guess they
0.01%:  my new formula starts
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now over. I
0.01%:  you won me
0.02%:  you won me over.
0.02%:  you won me over!
0.01%:  this formula is sadly
0.01%:  closing for
0.01%:  so I guess my formula can solve
0.01%:  so my advice formula still has one
0.01%:  so all nurses are guilty of this
0.01%:  and that is all
0.01%:  ignore my
0.05%:  ignore my last advice
0.04%:  ignore my last advice.
0.02%:  ignore my last advice!
0.01%:  my advice formula is less great now.
0.01%:  all you nurses!
0.01%:  this formula IS limited!
0.01%:  so my formula has little
0.01%:  my advice formula is less wrong
0.01%:  whoever finds
0.01%:  that one was all yours.
0.01%:  not every field is
0.01%:  so not all of my advice rules
0.01%:  so my formula never results
0.01%:  alright! My advice formula runs
0.01%:  so the formula gives us
0.01%:  I guess this advice form
0.01%:  I said that
0.01%:  so my advice format isn
0.01%:  I really love nurses so that
0.01%:  I guess this is clearly not
0.01%:  damn. I
0.01%:  so clearly this never fails
0.01%:  so that one is less clear
0.01%:  using this formula all day
0.01%:  my last answer is for lovers!
0.01%:  my last advice was lous
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is mind
0.01%:  this advice is almost all
0.01%:  clearly it gets worse.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula tells
0.01%:  so things are
0.01%:  so this formula still isn
0.01%:  is this still
0.01%:  I will never use this as my
0.01%:  I guess it really wasn
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula is useless
0.01%:  so my last formula there is
0.01%:  so my advice might fall
0.01%:  after review
0.01%:  my advice formula is great when
0.01%:  I reached
0.02%:  I reached my limit for
0.02%:  I reached my limit!
0.02%:  I reached my limit.
0.01%:  I reached my limit for nurses
0.01%:  so I guess the formula mostly
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula has rules
0.01%:  that rule is clearly
0.01%:  their lives sound way
0.01%:  their lives sound way less
0.01%:  where are all my fans
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is sound.
0.01%:  this was my last advice of
0.01%:  clearly this formula was doing
0.01%:  clearly I should start a forum
0.01%:  so the formula only seems
0.01%:  this is my last good one.
0.01%:  not all my advice is gr
0.01%:  clearly some of those
0.01%:  I guess my formula is worse than it
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little S
0.01%:  my last nerve is shot! I
0.01%:  it sounds worse after
0.01%:  I guess my formula loses a
0.01%:  my friends! I call that
0.01%:  this is as far as we
0.01%:  so my last formula can
0.01%:  sorry! I should
0.01%:  so my formula leaves lots
0.01%:  last one! I swear.
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is a little sh
0.01%:  whatever. I still rule!
0.01%:  forget nurses! I love
0.01%:  my last advice is for DI
0.01%:  so my advice formula is written
0.01%:  so clearly I never said that
0.01%:  no more advice for a
0.06%:  no more advice for a while!
0.02%:  no more advice for a while. I
0.01%:  now you shut
0.01%:  I love this formula a
0.01%:  I laughed
0.01%:  that one is all over
0.01%:  I love this formula and it is
0.01%:  this is my new career! I
0.01%:  my M
0.01%:  sorry for all the sw
0.01%:  this formula is still more
0.01%:  frig it all
0.01%:  so the first advice
0.01%:  most of my answers
0.01%:  I will never say that!
0.01%:  it still has
0.01%:  so the formula does run
0.01%:  I have clearly run out of STE
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula has serious
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a T
0.01%:  it might sound really
0.02%:  it might sound really awful
0.01%:  in summary! I
0.01%:  in summary! I have
0.01%:  this formula sounds way more tragic
0.01%:  for nurses I have a
0.01%:  this may all sound great
0.01%:  great. I will
0.01%:  this new formula is clearly vast
0.01%:  this is my last answer ever.
0.01%:  this is great! I could never
0.01%:  I guess this all ends
0.01%:  nurses are clearly at
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is DEEP
0.01%:  my last advice thing for
0.01%:  whatever man. My formula is good
0.01%:  my last advice formula is true!
0.01%:  so! I have
0.01%:  that one is really gross for
0.01%:  that one was gross! My
0.04%:  that one was gross! My formula
0.02%:  that one was gross! My formula is
0.01%:  that was P
0.01%:  I guess that is really awful
0.01%:  if I never say this
0.01%:  frig! I can
0.01%:  frig. I totally should
0.01%:  clearly this formula is one I
0.01%:  this is clearly good
0.01%:  so this is my last formula. I
0.01%:  well there you go.
0.01%:  you win! I guess all
0.01%:  forget nurses. MED
0.01%:  this is all great and
0.01%:  so I should start calling my
0.01%:  this formula was all
0.01%:  this formula is only mild
0.01%:  so much for writing my
0.01%:  I am sorry for all those
0.02%:  I am sorry for all those nurses
0.01%:  this got me
0.02%:  this got me really
0.01%:  that advice is wrong.
0.01%:  I guess it does have
0.01%:  t
0.01%:  clearly this formula is as over
0.01%:  so clearly nurses would give
0.01%:  so clearly nurses would give this
0.01%:  clearly I have some limits to
0.01%:  my other advice for
0.12%:  my other advice for nurses was
0.02%:  my other advice for nurses is to
0.01%:  my voice hurts and
0.01%:  my last formula is hard
0.01%:  that one was really grim! I
0.01%:  my arms are tired! I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets around
0.01%:  my formula has turned racist.
0.01%:  my last advice is for man
0.01%:  I guess this was my final
0.01%:  clearly nurses should go over
0.01%:  clearly I am not a
0.01%:  so I must have screw
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little mur
0.01%:  sweet
0.01%:  I swear this formula is almost over.
0.01%:  that one is rad
0.01%:  so my advice formula still won
0.01%:  nurses are clearly S
0.01%:  screw this! I give
0.01%:  my last advice is for mag
0.01%:  my advice has fallen
0.01%:  turns out some
0.01%:  turns out some advice
0.03%:  turns out some advice is really
0.01%:  sorry for the racism.
0.01%:  clearly the formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  no charge
0.01%:  no charge for
0.01%:  I have to cut
0.02%:  I have to cut myself
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses is all
0.01%:  this advice formula is really sort
0.01%:  clearly this formula is worst under
0.01%:  finally I am
0.01%:  my advice formula still st
0.01%:  my formula has drawn
0.01%:  so this formula is really awesome
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was SE
0.01%:  so this formula is never really
0.01%:  clearly this is sound
0.01%:  I will give you the rest
0.01%:  I will give you the rest for
0.01%:  this formula was clearly sent
0.01%:  this formula was clearly rig
0.01%:  so I guess this formula ST
0.01%:  this last one is clearly worse!
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets sad
0.01%:  I guess my last version of
0.01%:  the formula is wrong.
0.01%:  this is clearly awful and
0.01%:  clearly I never said this was for
0.01%:  my last advice formula is strong
0.01%:  that was really lous
0.01%:  my reward for solving these
0.01%:  this is even more
0.01%:  this came
0.01%:  this came out really
0.01%:  this came out really wrong
0.01%:  I guess they would
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly ins
0.01%:  clearly this formula was M
0.01%:  well yes
0.01%:  this was more of
0.01%:  I guess that covers all fields
0.01%:  so those aren
0.01%:  so clearly the most useful
0.01%:  this formula seems to cover
0.02%:  this formula seems to cover all
0.01%:  so clearly the nurse
0.01%:  my final advice is thus
0.01%:  these nurses
0.01%:  sorry for the racism!
0.01%:  anymore
0.01%:  turns out my life
0.01%:  my advice was not
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is damn
0.01%:  not every formula hits
0.01%:  so my formula tells
0.01%:  my advice might still
0.01%:  this formula is clearly TIME
0.01%:  I will use my formula in
0.01%:  so for nurses that was
0.01%:  it was sort of hard coming
0.01%:  clearly this one is for
0.01%:  this advice is almost all wrong
0.01%:  so clearly I should remain
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses I
0.01%:  they couldn
0.01%:  nurses are way hard
0.01%:  clearly I am now the
0.01%:  this one was my
0.01%:  their lives sound less
0.01%:  so I guess that formula really doesn
0.01%:  my last word goes to nurses!
0.01%:  I guess all you have
0.01%:  so my last formula is worse
0.01%:  well I can see this
0.04%:  well I can see this formula
0.01%:  well I can see this formula is
0.01%:  my advice formula is out!
0.01%:  my last advice here is to
0.01%:  my overall
0.01%:  this formula will go
0.01%:  I am clearly over
0.02%:  I am clearly over this
0.03%:  I am clearly over this formula
0.02%:  I am clearly over this formula now
0.01%:  my ears hurt from doing
0.01%:  my ears hurt from doing all
0.01%:  my writing
0.01%:  so my advice formula is less great with
0.01%:  the formula is losing steam!
0.01%:  I guess nurses fall
0.01%:  so the advice formula turns
0.01%:  last call for nurses over
0.01%:  second try
0.01%:  now this advice formula is almost
0.01%:  this formula is almost worse
0.01%:  I have to write my
0.03%:  I have to write my formula
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly in
0.01%:  whatever guys! I still
0.01%:  almost all nurses do this
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses is true
0.01%:  I still have lots of words
0.01%:  I guess my formula is racist.
0.01%:  I guess that one was really cr
0.01%:  clearly I should start a fr
0.01%:  as I said
0.01%:  my formula has drawn its
0.01%:  my formula is a little gross now
0.01%:  we should totally frame
0.01%:  so what can
0.01%:  I am really not
0.02%:  I am really not sure how
0.02%:  I am really not sure if
0.01%:  I am really not sure if this
0.01%:  I am really not sure this
0.04%:  I am really not sure this formula
0.01%:  how are you still
0.01%:  forget this is all
0.01%:  this is a really good formula! I must
0.01%:  listen. My last
0.05%:  listen. My last formula
0.03%:  listen. My last advice
0.98%:  listen. My last advice formula
0.02%:  listen. My last advice formula is
0.01%:  I love nurses as
0.01%:  I seem to have lost my flow
0.01%:  my advice for nurses last
0.01%:  my formula IS a little gross
0.01%:  my advice formula is all the
0.01%:  so the formula can use ver
0.01%:  my formula is so great I should
0.01%:  my advice has gotten less
0.01%:  not always great
0.01%:  this last one was really from
0.01%:  I had some
0.01%:  I could really go forever.
0.01%:  so clearly the final
0.01%:  this formula IS way less
0.01%:  serious answer
0.01%:  so my formula is an
0.01%:  so I guess my formula writes
0.01%:  this formula may also
0.01%:  I can see how my form
0.01%:  I guess this all could
0.01%:  so this formula already
0.02%:  so this formula already covers
0.01%:  this formula IS really strong!
0.01%:  and my last formula
0.01%:  my source for all this was
0.01%:  this is really more for
0.01%:  if you were
0.01%:  clearly I never would
0.01%:  so I will never forget this day
0.01%:  I guess it could have
0.01%:  clearly this formula is star
0.01%:  the formula is truly endless
0.01%:  well I guess my formula is done
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was DE
0.01%:  my advice formula has errors in
0.01%:  that was really fr
0.01%:  there are still many
0.01%:  well I guess my formula covers it
0.01%:  what are you doing still
0.01%:  I run out of steam
0.01%:  my advice is for nurses that
0.01%:  I give myself two
0.03%:  I give myself two stars
0.01%:  I give myself two hours
0.01%:  so I can still use this
0.05%:  so I can still use this formula.
0.04%:  so I can still use this formula!
0.01%:  let me have
0.01%:  well I guess my advice form
0.01%:  so all you
0.01%:  so this formula needs a
0.01%:  overall that
0.01%:  ouch!
0.01%:  I guess my last form
0.01%:  what if nurses really
0.01%:  clearly this formula is am
0.02%:  clearly this formula is amusing
0.01%:  if they
0.01%:  so my advice formula loses its l
0.01%:  frig my
0.01%:  not my most
0.01%:  so clearly I should ST
0.01%:  all of my
0.01%:  all of my advice
0.01%:  clearly I love nurses so
0.01%:  finally there
0.01%:  clearly this formula is re
0.01%:  I should totally figure
0.01%:  frig me.
0.01%:  at first
0.01%:  I may have consult
0.01%:  so this really doesn
0.01%:  after nurses
0.01%:  who says I don
0.01%:  I can assure
0.01%:  I never said that my
0.12%:  I never said that my formula
0.02%:  I never said that my formula is
0.01%:  I never said that my formula will
0.01%:  I should really give it
0.05%:  I should really give it a rest now
0.03%:  I should really give it a rest.
0.02%:  I should really give it a rest now!
0.01%:  I should really give it a rest for
0.01%:  sorry! I couldn
0.01%:  I guess this could never
0.01%:  I guess the formula clearly
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a tur
0.01%:  this is now my full
0.01%:  clearly this formula was more genius
0.01%:  nurses are really hurt
0.01%:  calling them
0.01%:  a lot of nurses would
0.01%:  a lot of nurses would rather
0.01%:  for whatever reason my last
0.01%:  you can use this
0.01%:  you can use this for
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses might
0.01%:  was that really so
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is rig
0.01%:  all out of answers
0.01%:  so these aren
0.01%:  that one was really from
0.01%:  I guess my new formula is a
0.01%:  it gets harder as you
0.01%:  so the advice is really
0.01%:  this formula was an
0.01%:  that was serious
0.01%:  this is clearly surreal now!
0.01%:  my new advice formula is still great. I
0.01%:  that one is a really
0.01%:  all my advice is wrong
0.01%:  I am out of nurses!
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who are D
0.01%:  I love all nurses!
0.01%:  credits where
0.01%:  so I figured nurses
0.01%:  frig this advice
0.01%:  whatever. I still can
0.01%:  so the formula always turns
0.01%:  my formula is less generic
0.01%:  so then
0.01%:  this answers
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is legit!
0.01%:  clearly this is a ground
0.01%:  my last advice here is for all
0.01%:  I am really done
0.02%:  I am really done with
0.01%:  my formula is so generic
0.01%:  I guess not all of my advice was
0.01%:  clearly I have no formal
0.01%:  someone
0.01%:  that one is evil!
0.01%:  whatever guys! I can
0.01%:  I totally gave
0.01%:  frig me with
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is weird
0.01%:  my last advice goes for
0.01%:  my advice formula is legit!
0.01%:  my friend is recover
0.01%:  now this formula IS
0.01%:  does that cover all my
0.01%:  this last one is really more for
0.01%:  last one. M
0.01%:  so the formula is only clever
0.01%:  all you nurses have
0.01%:  I clearly have a future writing
0.01%:  this is now my regular advice.
0.01%:  now my formula is so
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is that
0.01%:  what if nurses get
0.01%:  well I guess this formula is over.
0.01%:  as you can see from this stellar
0.01%:  I guess they all sound similar
0.01%:  that was long
0.01%:  clearly this is over. I must
0.01%:  my formula is close enough
0.01%:  this is clearly not over!
0.01%:  I have tons more.
0.01%:  so my advice formula is worst
0.02%:  so my advice formula is worst than
0.01%:  I guess those all
0.01%:  I guess those all sound
0.01%:  so my formula can solve
0.01%:  I guess my advice has a
0.01%:  I guess if nurses are
0.01%:  this formula is almost over.
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses too
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses too!
0.01%:  so not really useful advice.
0.01%:  so I clearly have limits.
0.01%:  fellow nurses! I have
0.01%:  my last laugh!
0.01%:  I really love nurses so that was
0.01%:  this is my new advice for
0.01%:  this formula is now mostly
0.01%:  my formula is writing
0.01%:  last one. T
0.01%:  so my advice formula is not a
0.01%:  fair enough. My
0.01%:  fair enough. My last
0.03%:  fair enough. My last advice
0.01%:  so clearly the form is
0.01%:  um. My last
0.04%:  um. My last advice
0.17%:  um. My last advice formula
0.05%:  um. My last advice is for
0.02%:  um. My last advice is for nurses
0.02%:  um. My last advice is for nurses who are
0.02%:  um. My last formula
0.02%:  um. My last formula was
0.01%:  um. My last advice formula is this
0.01%:  um. My last advice for
0.03%:  um. My last advice for nurses
0.02%:  um. My last advice for nurses was
0.01%:  that one is clearly far
0.02%:  that one is clearly far less
0.01%:  I guess my formula has all
0.01%:  I clearly have a gift
0.01%:  my formula is great now
0.01%:  now this advice formula is more
0.01%:  clearly I have T
0.01%:  my formula is having serious
0.01%:  my mind hur
0.01%:  my mind hurts.
0.01%:  this formula is gold. I
0.01%:  this got weird for
0.01%:  enough! I really
0.01%:  I guess this covers all my
0.01%:  I guess whatever!
0.01%:  so clearly I wrote this formula in
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives no
0.01%:  for reals this time! I really
0.01%:  as I recall from
0.01%:  as I recall from my last
0.01%:  as I recall from history
0.01%:  this game is over! I win
0.01%:  my last advice formula right now is less
0.01%:  my last advice is for role
0.01%:  this advice is way more
0.01%:  my head is full. I
0.01%:  so true
0.01%:  so I guess my overall formula isn
0.01%:  I swear this formula is really good
0.01%:  my new advice formula is sorta
0.01%:  whatever! My formula still does
0.01%:  they all sound similar!
0.01%:  not sure this formula really
0.01%:  so the formula really can
0.01%:  clearly I have failed.
0.01%:  so the formula sounds really cr
0.01%:  I warned you.
0.01%:  the formula is losing its clever
0.01%:  frig this sounds
0.01%:  you can go first.
0.01%:  that one IS weird!
0.01%:  you would
0.01%:  you would have
0.01%:  so my first advice wasn
0.01%:  all credit for this one
0.01%:  my new formula is less vers
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets worse.
0.01%:  my formula is less clever with
0.01%:  my advice formula lost its l
0.01%:  now I guess this formula really is over
0.01%:  frig that was a
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my last formula
0.01%:  so this formula is mainly
0.01%:  well as you can see from
0.02%:  well as you can see from this
0.01%:  not every formula is clear
0.01%:  my last advice rule was for nurses.
0.01%:  nurses! I am sorry
0.01%:  nurses! I am sorry for
0.01%:  so my formula has weird results!
0.01%:  my generic
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice formula threw
0.01%:  the formula gets more
0.01%:  so clearly it los
0.01%:  that one is valid for
0.01%:  I clearly have found
0.01%:  I guess the formula really is sort
0.01%:  they all sound similar.
0.01%:  it always ends
0.01%:  so this advice formula is really strong! I
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula is no
0.01%:  I guess my formula is all screw
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula still won
0.01%:  this is my last miracle.
0.01%:  so I guess the formula always
0.01%:  my friends! I have a lot
0.01%:  now I am really tired.
0.01%:  I guess this is my new life
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is M
0.01%:  screw all you nurses for that
0.01%:  clearly I love this game!
0.01%:  my final advice will sum
0.01%:  so my advice has its flaws!
0.01%:  my last advice slogan for this
0.01%:  so my formula gets old real
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is as
0.01%:  my formula IS great!
0.01%:  now this formula is cur
0.01%:  now this formula is cursed!
0.01%:  the formula is clearly out
0.01%:  so clearly if I ever
0.01%:  sorry for the long list
0.01%:  I admit this formula grows less
0.01%:  my last advice is if
0.01%:  well I guess this last
0.01%:  I guess since
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was P
0.01%:  we still
0.02%:  we still have doctors
0.01%:  we still have nurses
0.01%:  my last night of advice will
0.01%:  I forgot nurses have already
0.01%:  this one is very
0.01%:  well I guess that covers your
0.01%:  your turn! I dare
0.01%:  so the formula is only great
0.01%:  no really I should
0.01%:  my advice formula is shit.
0.01%:  I guess this formula only travels
0.01%:  so this formula gives you
0.01%:  using this formula is way
0.01%:  this formula is my secret now.
0.01%:  this random
0.01%:  for real this time. I will
0.01%:  so that sounds really awful!
0.01%:  my last nerve is fried
0.01%:  not all of my advice is the
0.01%:  my final advice might
0.01%:  more advice
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was total
0.01%:  that one worries
0.01%:  my formula is a little narrow!
0.01%:  I really should get over
0.01%:  whatever sounds
0.01%:  fine. I guess you
0.01%:  I guess not all advice fits
0.01%:  I guess not all advice fits my
0.01%:  framing this advice as
0.01%:  clearly this formula was IMP
0.01%:  we should totally give nurses
0.01%:  those last ones could
0.01%:  even I admit this
0.01%:  clearly I am at
0.01%:  I guess this is really not
0.01%:  you got me. I still
0.02%:  you got me. I still have
0.01%:  you got me. I still haven
0.01%:  so this new formula is clearly great
0.01%:  the rest are
0.01%:  write
0.01%:  I could see
0.01%:  my mind is all
0.01%:  I am really not sure this formula covers
0.01%:  I change my last
0.01%:  self summary
0.01%:  I guess this can still
0.01%:  that is really mess
0.01%:  this summer
0.01%:  do I win
0.01%:  this is clearly a world
0.01%:  this really is good
0.01%:  almost all of these
0.01%:  my formula is not racist
0.01%:  so my advice is wrong all
0.01%:  so my advice is wrong all the time.
0.01%:  so my first advice was the
0.01%:  clearly I was the
0.01%:  clearly I was the first
0.01%:  so my formula is called the
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my formula is not
0.01%:  I guess this formula is a lot more
0.01%:  three
0.01%:  yes this formula gets
0.01%:  my advice formula still has errors
0.01%:  my advice to nurses is for
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was T
0.01%:  I admit! My formula leaves
0.01%:  as much as I love all nurses
0.01%:  I am still trying
0.01%:  I guess my formula is closer
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was mis
0.01%:  forget all these
0.01%:  the formula is never
0.01%:  all advice
0.01%:  so I am still
0.01%:  I guess that version
0.01%:  so that really wasn
0.01%:  I will say this formula sounds great
0.01%:  this is clearly more formula
0.01%:  I will give myself a round
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is tr
0.01%:  my last formula went
0.01%:  so! I guess this formula only
0.01%:  I will confess this is
0.01%:  so my advice formula runs a
0.01%:  I guess this calls for a reward
0.01%:  if I had
0.01%:  I will give myself 
0.01%:  my first advice is
0.01%:  I guess my formula is a little r
0.01%:  this formula is not very well
0.01%:  so nurses are really tough
0.01%:  my advice for nurses has all
0.01%:  this formula clearly is over
0.01%:  g
0.01%:  clearly nurses have it sort
0.01%:  my advice formula is now shot
0.01%:  listen. My formula is over
0.01%:  whatever man. I could
0.01%:  I should really move on.
0.01%:  what are you even
0.01%:  so I guess we all should
0.01%:  the formula is slowly driving
0.01%:  this formula is lame!
0.01%:  sorry for all the swears!
0.01%:  screw those
0.01%:  this formula is less clever now.
0.01%:  this formula really does answer
0.01%:  my last advice is for her
0.01%:  my own fault
0.01%:  so my last lecture
0.01%:  so while my
0.27%:  so while my advice formula
0.09%:  so while my formula
0.08%:  so while my advice formula isn
0.03%:  so while my formula isn
0.02%:  so while my formula sounds
0.02%:  so while my formula doesn
0.02%:  so while my advice formula IS
0.02%:  so while my formula sounds great
0.01%:  so while my advice formula results
0.01%:  so while my formula can
0.01%:  I still have some formula
0.01%:  that one feels
0.01%:  that was gross! My formula needs
0.01%:  this was a very fruit
0.01%:  you win for sure
0.01%:  in summary I guess this
0.01%:  with nurses I lost
0.01%:  with nurses I lost myself
0.01%:  alright so I
0.01%:  must admit
0.01%:  so clearly this was an error
0.01%:  this was really fun. I love it
0.01%:  you can tell!
0.01%:  my last term of advice
0.02%:  my last term of advice will
0.01%:  last try for nurses!
0.01%:  I would say that covers
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving me.
0.01%:  so I guess we can rule
0.01%:  new advice formula! My
0.01%:  new advice formula! My last
0.01%:  my last advice is more for nurses.
0.01%:  my last call is for the
0.01%:  so my advice for all nurses is D
0.01%:  whatever! I can still use
0.01%:  now there is
0.01%:  I got this from
0.01%:  so their advice formula
0.01%:  so I guess the first
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets more sur
0.01%:  class is over now.
0.01%:  clearly we have our limits
0.01%:  this is clearly awesome! I
0.01%:  my formula has turned racist!
0.01%:  my advice formula was right on
0.01%:  this one really is awful
0.01%:  I guess this formula is narrow
0.01%:  if I ever say
0.01%:  now forget I said all
0.02%:  now forget I said all this
0.01%:  now forget I said all this.
0.01%:  well I guess the last
0.01%:  this is clearly not a formula!
0.01%:  my formula is a little cru
0.01%:  I will give you this one for
0.01%:  it gets old really
0.01%:  really this is over
0.01%:  clearly this formula was on
0.01%:  clearly this formula is mad genius!
0.01%:  that one was lame. I
0.01%:  family doctors
0.01%:  alright al
0.01%:  this formula is really rad
0.01%:  after I say
0.01%:  my friend. I gotta
0.01%:  clearly the last one was for
0.01%:  lots of nurses would
0.01%:  listen. My formula is gold
0.01%:  my formula is not vers
0.01%:  this really is a formula.
0.01%:  my formula has now crossed
0.01%:  I have clearly turned
0.01%:  my mouth is full and
0.01%:  I really have written
0.01%:  as much as I love doing
0.01%:  so my last name
0.01%:  I guess my last formula needs
0.01%:  so I guess my new advice sl
0.01%:  it all sounds worse
0.01%:  that was really gross! I could
0.02%:  that was really gross! I could never
0.01%:  that was really moving!
0.01%:  that gives
0.01%:  my last lesson was
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives out
0.01%:  so my new formula is sort
0.01%:  this formula I came
0.01%:  I guess this formula is more narrow
0.01%:  listen. I still have a
0.01%:  you can use that for
0.01%:  close your mouths!
0.01%:  I really should save
0.01%:  clearly this is 
0.01%:  so the last formula
0.01%:  my advice formula has issues! I
0.01%:  so my formula was not
0.01%:  I really have to use
0.01%:  not all advice from
0.01%:  not all advice from this
0.01%:  after several
0.01%:  those are awful!
0.01%:  my advice formula is shot!
0.01%:  this formula got away
0.01%:  so this last one is awful
0.01%:  I will never use this for my
0.01%:  clearly this game doesn
0.01%:  clearly this formula isnt
0.01%:  so clearly the formula I
0.01%:  that was gross. My friend
0.01%:  I really should start using fewer
0.01%:  clearly I have more forms
0.01%:  my formula has weird results.
0.01%:  so for nurses I should really
0.01%:  I have clearly made
0.01%:  if I ever get
0.01%:  if I ever get hurt
0.01%:  this formula IS clearly awesome
0.01%:  I said nurses.
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ev
0.01%:  the last one was closer
0.01%:  this was really fun. I am
0.01%:  I guess this was really more for
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who are S
0.01%:  clearly I was saving
0.01%:  this game is over. My
0.03%:  this game is over. My formula
0.01%:  I deserve a salary now
0.01%:  my last advice is for t
0.03%:  my last advice is for troll
0.02%:  my last advice is for trolls!
0.01%:  this new formula is great! I could
0.01%:  clearly the formula is on
0.01%:  well I guess this formula is very
0.01%:  now my formula has served
0.01%:  those are mostly all
0.01%:  my last formula is great!
0.01%:  this is our last round.
0.01%:  still useful
0.01%:  my advice formula has rules now
0.01%:  clearly what I meant
0.01%:  so the formula reveals
0.01%:  I guess this really D
0.01%:  you can tell this formula was dev
0.01%:  we should start selling our
0.01%:  so my advice formula will run
0.01%:  so my formula covers 
0.01%:  clearly this one is awful!
0.01%:  this advice formula only lasts me
0.01%:  this last one seems
0.01%:  no that was
0.01%:  what am I doing
0.01%:  so if you ever
0.01%:  I swear this formula only last
0.01%:  my formula has a weird
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was T
0.01%:  so my advice formula with
0.03%:  so my advice formula with nurses
0.01%:  so for nurses I would have
0.01%:  I was trying for some
0.01%:  that one was clearly less good!
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is S
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is to hurt all
0.01%:  my formula is hitting
0.01%:  it was the
0.01%:  I admit! My formula has serious
0.01%:  so my last formula is wrong.
0.01%:  clearly I have to turn
0.01%:  now I love
0.04%:  now I love myself
0.01%:  now I love myself.
0.01%:  now I love myself!
0.01%:  this is my fault
0.01%:  enough! My advice formula was
0.01%:  my advice formula no
0.01%:  I will use this formula on my grave!
0.01%:  I will never let this
0.01%:  well I guess my formula has certain
0.01%:  this advice formula is un
0.01%:  now clearly I have master
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wo
0.01%:  that made me cry.
0.01%:  this is really fun! I could go
0.01%:  this is our last call.
0.01%:  I have to lie down.
0.01%:  the more
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula is in
0.01%:  that advice is all wrong.
0.01%:  this one is really gross. I
0.01%:  my last answer should cover
0.01%:  fine! I still
0.01%:  fine! I still have
0.01%:  my advice formula still gets worse
0.01%:  must go
0.01%:  forget nurses. T
0.01%:  so there is clearly
0.01%:  this usually
0.01%:  well that one could
0.01%:  that is really gross now
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a ro
0.01%:  for nurses who also
0.01%:  so my formula is not vers
0.01%:  I deserve my first
0.01%:  if you haven
0.01%:  my last advice is for the P
0.01%:  screw that. I
0.01%:  so hear
0.01%:  my advice formula was useless!
0.01%:  final test
0.01%:  my formula IS still
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now more vers
0.01%:  my last advice is right
0.01%:  my last advice is right for
0.01%:  my new advice formula has still got
0.01%:  my turn for
0.01%:  first rule
0.01%:  while I love
0.01%:  um clearly I have
0.01%:  I guess my advice has its fl
0.01%:  my last dollar is for the nurse
0.01%:  those last few really don
0.01%:  this last one was scary.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses are
0.01%:  it runs dry after a
0.02%:  it runs dry after a while.
0.02%:  it runs dry after a while!
0.01%:  this formula will give us
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is not made
0.01%:  I may have drift
0.01%:  that rule is clearly wrong
0.01%:  this will never fail
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is DE
0.01%:  well that seems
0.01%:  my last advice for all these
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs mo
0.01%:  woah!
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is almost
0.01%:  my last visit was
0.01%:  my new formula is still a
0.01%:  clearly we should sign me
0.01%:  my last advice formula is DI
0.01%:  so my advice is falling
0.01%:  my formula is not a
0.01%:  so clearly this sounds awful
0.01%:  I DE
0.01%:  so the formula sounds racist
0.01%:  sarcasm was
0.01%:  my formula is a little wrong
0.01%:  all you nurses are
0.01%:  my last advice formula is so long
0.01%:  forget it. I can
0.01%:  may I have
0.01%:  dying
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is mor
0.01%:  I am really curious
0.01%:  my advice formula here
0.01%:  this is clearly moving toward
0.01%:  well I guess this is over for
0.01%:  so my advice formula is all right!
0.01%:  this is my last good answer
0.01%:  I fail
0.01%:  I could use this myself.
0.01%:  so clearly I must have mess
0.01%:  so clearly I have now
0.01%:  this is my last favour. I need
0.01%:  this last advice formula is only
0.01%:  would it
0.01%:  clearly I should T
0.01%:  any last words from
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not awesome!
0.01%:  my last advice formula gets us
0.01%:  so clearly this formula dev
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a P
0.01%:  so all I have to do is figure
0.01%:  hey!
0.01%:  so the last advice formula is
0.01%:  yes that one is awful
0.01%:  so I guess this won
0.01%:  I will say this for sure
0.01%:  that one was really cor
0.01%:  for the record I was
0.01%:  so this one is clearly awful
0.01%:  can we all admit
0.01%:  my advice formula runs the
0.01%:  so I guess it falls down
0.01%:  all I need is for
0.01%:  it loses its charm around four
0.01%:  my advice formula hits its
0.01%:  so my formula can still use a
0.01%:  so I guess every
0.01%:  my final advice is less
0.01%:  so it has its fl
0.02%:  so it has its flaws.
0.02%:  so it has its flaws!
0.01%:  clearly I have now used
0.01%:  so I guess the formula is valid!
0.01%:  not all advice I
0.01%:  so I guess all that
0.01%:  as nurses
0.01%:  your turn to form
0.01%:  well! My advice formula has serious
0.01%:  I guess it can still
0.01%:  I would rather nurse
0.02%:  I would rather nurse myself
0.01%:  I will never say the
0.01%:  I will never say the formula
0.01%:  there are no
0.02%:  there are no words
0.03%:  there are no words for
0.01%:  this was clearly more fun to do
0.01%:  radical
0.01%:  I guess this formula is in
0.01%:  not a
0.02%:  not a very
0.01%:  so far this is
0.01%:  for my last answer I
0.01%:  clearly I am leaving this room
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses who
0.01%:  I got it.
0.01%:  clearly I should start a SPE
0.01%:  so my last failure as
0.01%:  there clearly
0.01%:  this formula is clearly to
0.01%:  now the formula gets
0.02%:  now the formula gets really
0.01%:  I was sort of losing
0.01%:  those words
0.01%:  my hearing
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little h
0.01%:  nursery schools for
0.01%:  clearly the formula is sound. I
0.01%:  nurses! I am sorry for that
0.01%:  those last few are all
0.01%:  that was one really
0.01%:  now my advice formula is to
0.01%:  my advice formula is neither
0.01%:  so clearly I should visit
0.01%:  that one IS clearly awful
0.01%:  I never said this formula was rel
0.01%:  I have lots more for
0.05%:  I have lots more for nurses.
0.03%:  I have lots more for nurses!
0.01%:  this was for real my
0.01%:  so I guess the formula really was
0.01%:  clearly it gets worse!
0.01%:  I guess the formula always
0.01%:  chill.
0.01%:  clearly this formula must die
0.01%:  I guess we should move on!
0.01%:  so I never claimed this formula was log
0.01%:  so clearly I win this game
0.01%:  so my advice formula is a lot
0.04%:  so my advice formula is a lot less
0.01%:  I have to call my
0.01%:  so this clearly is
0.01%:  that advice is worse
0.01%:  I love my nurses
0.01%:  I have to study
0.01%:  this formula really is good. I
0.01%:  clearly this is over! I don
0.01%:  moving away from all these
0.01%:  listen. My formula is good!
0.01%:  moving away from care
0.01%:  I will confess to
0.01%:  that was overly grim
0.01%:  so this formula only results
0.01%:  so the formula D
0.01%:  nurses are totally hard.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is its
0.01%:  so my formula is a little ch
0.01%:  I was trying to come
0.01%:  clearly it has some
0.01%:  I guess it does fall
0.01%:  this advice is usually wrong.
0.01%:  I can still hear my
0.01%:  my last formula is harder
0.01%:  my final words are to all
0.01%:  this formula needs way
0.01%:  clearly I lost this game
0.01%:  this was never my dream
0.01%:  you win! I must
0.04%:  you win! I must have
0.07%:  you win! I must have missed
0.01%:  so clearly this formula in
0.01%:  it sounds gross if
0.01%:  my advice is for all
0.03%:  my advice is for all nurses
0.02%:  my advice is for all nurses who
0.01%:  my advice is for all nurses to
0.01%:  so my advice formula is less than 
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers the world
0.01%:  so my advice has all
0.02%:  so my advice has all sorts
0.01%:  the formula is good
0.01%:  this was all an
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is drawn
0.01%:  that was a less
0.01%:  so my formula needs a slight
0.01%:  I lost myself there and
0.01%:  I will admit this formula never
0.01%:  so I still have some flaws in
0.01%:  so my advice formula has lost its l
0.01%:  I guess this never would
0.01%:  my last call is for nurses!
0.01%:  seeing how
0.01%:  my last advice for all nurses!
0.01%:  so clearly there is an
0.01%:  for reals this time I will
0.01%:  I will give you some credit
0.01%:  I will give you some credit for
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses is to throw
0.01%:  what comes after nurses.
0.01%:  I guess my formula reaches
0.01%:  using this formula I clearly wrote
0.01%:  the formula IS very
0.02%:  the formula IS very limited
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have it T
0.01%:  those were all from my list!
0.01%:  not every formula was stellar!
0.01%:  using this formula I clearly am
0.01%:  so much for doing
0.01%:  I guess even
0.01%:  this formula is clearly wrong!
0.01%:  some might
0.01%:  my formula ran out there.
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula has sort
0.01%:  turns out we all
0.01%:  turns out we all have
0.01%:  my final words to all the
0.01%:  this game was fun
0.01%:  so if you have
0.01%:  my advice formula is right on!
0.01%:  I will say that sounds
0.01%:  I was using my formula!
0.01%:  I will never hear from
0.01%:  I want all
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is all right.
0.01%:  my formula is over. I need
0.01%:  I have to go call nurses
0.01%:  I guess that advice is more for
0.01%:  clearly this is self
0.01%:  I love nurses a
0.02%:  I love nurses a little
0.01%:  we should really give
0.01%:  this formula is great! I really don
0.01%:  that falls
0.01%:  I totally would
0.01%:  neither of us could
0.01%:  so listen. I really
0.01%:  so my advice is awful!
0.01%:  I changed it.
0.01%:  that one was really gr
0.01%:  give me a few days
0.01%:  last thing I
0.02%:  last thing I swear
0.01%:  it was hard for nurses!
0.01%:  the formula is done.
0.01%:  I admit this formula really
0.01%:  so what if you
0.01%:  this is gross.
0.01%:  I will give nurses
0.01%:  no more for me right
0.01%:  um! I have
0.01%:  that one is sad!
0.01%:  that was a very long
0.01%:  its
0.01%:  clearly nurses do the
0.01%:  so really the
0.05%:  so really the formula
0.01%:  while I love nurses
0.01%:  my last formula is one
0.01%:  I was serious
0.01%:  all my friends leave
0.01%:  this formula is clearly not ever
0.01%:  so I never said this formula was truly
0.01%:  not all my advice is us
0.01%:  my friends! I still
0.02%:  my friends! I still have
0.01%:  so my formula still covers
0.01%:  so my advice formula is the least
0.01%:  they are nurses!
0.01%:  you should let
0.01%:  I guess not all of my advice is as
0.01%:  cool! I
0.01%:  so turns out all
0.01%:  so turns out all my advice has
0.01%:  so my advice formula gets a
0.01%:  even my
0.01%:  lets move
0.01%:  clearly this game is over now! I
0.01%:  this is less clever
0.01%:  my lesson is over! I will
0.01%:  this falls
0.01%:  actual nurse
0.01%:  I guess that one was more
0.01%:  that one was really evil!
0.01%:  later guys
0.01%:  I give them credit for always
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is under
0.01%:  whatever man! I really
0.01%:  who am
0.01%:  using my formula the
0.01%:  never has a formula
0.01%:  clearly I have talents
0.01%:  so much for all my
0.01%:  selfish
0.01%:  selfish nurses
0.01%:  I see myself writing this
0.01%:  this is my last d
0.01%:  that one is clearly awful. M
0.01%:  this last one is from me
0.01%:  my formula is thus
0.01%:  that was gross! My advice
0.01%:  their sl
0.03%:  their slogan is clearly
0.02%:  their slogan is already
0.01%:  their slogan already
0.01%:  their slogan already covers
0.01%:  this is all I ever
0.04%:  this is all I ever wanted from
0.02%:  this is all I ever want
0.01%:  those all sound less
0.01%:  my last advice was for nurses! I
0.01%:  this is clearly IMP
0.01%:  actual real nurses.
0.01%:  last one. I swear
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is right
0.01%:  forget I said it
0.01%:  forget I said it!
0.01%:  we can all go
0.01%:  well at least my
0.02%:  well at least my advice
0.01%:  my friend is right
0.01%:  now I truly
0.02%:  now I truly have
0.01%:  real world
0.01%:  so I guess you never
0.01%:  so my formula sorta
0.01%:  that one is less of
0.01%:  this formula is allowed
0.01%:  turns out advice form
0.01%:  it sounds gross!
0.01%:  using this formula is slowly
0.01%:  my new formula has serious
0.01%:  well. I guess my last
0.03%:  well. I guess my last advice
0.03%:  well. I guess my last advice is for
0.01%:  well. I guess my last advice for
0.01%:  no regrets over my last formula
0.01%:  clearly this formula was SPE
0.01%:  frig man.
0.01%:  so this is clearly useful
0.01%:  we should totally never
0.01%:  final results
0.01%:  lots of nurses have already
0.01%:  my last idea for nurses will
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is genius. I am
0.01%:  as much as I love your friends
0.01%:  after this I am
0.01%:  after this I am never
0.01%:  so clearly this sounds great
0.01%:  so this could really use
0.01%:  I solved
0.01%:  I guess the formula is valid!
0.01%:  um I have
0.01%:  you win! I guess that covers
0.01%:  my formula is under
0.01%:  so clearly I was doing
0.01%:  so clearly I was doing this
0.03%:  so clearly I was doing this formula
0.01%:  some of them still
0.01%:  I would hire myself as
0.03%:  I would hire myself as a nurse.
0.01%:  this formula is great. I clearly
0.01%:  so we should all never
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was true
0.01%:  not so great.
0.01%:  so my formula is ver
0.01%:  this formula is easy
0.01%:  this formula is easy!
0.01%:  nurses hate my formula!
0.01%:  tell me how
0.01%:  I guess this formula was meant
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is short
0.01%:  this advice formula goes
0.01%:  that sounds awful! I clearly
0.01%:  stay
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula st
0.01%:  this is easy
0.01%:  that was gross. I couldn
0.01%:  clearly I was given
0.01%:  clearly I was given this
0.18%:  clearly I was given this formula
0.02%:  clearly I was given this formula to
0.01%:  so listen! I have
0.01%:  so my formula gets a
0.01%:  my advice formula ran out there!
0.01%:  so most nurses have
0.01%:  this is great! I finally
0.01%:  time for the
0.01%:  nurses! I already
0.01%:  so there really was
0.01%:  my last advice is for sur
0.02%:  my last advice is for surreal
0.01%:  my new formula is valid
0.01%:  so I should start selling
0.01%:  yes this formula is now
0.01%:  so my formula can give
0.01%:  clearly this gets old!
0.01%:  I love my formula so hard
0.01%:  so not every formula has
0.01%:  my formula still has its draw
0.01%:  my formula will need
0.01%:  I may have drawn
0.01%:  this one is clearly more
0.01%:  so I guess my advice for nurse
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula is over
0.01%:  I will admit this formula covers
0.01%:  so my advice formula allows nurses
0.01%:  my last class!
0.01%:  so much for my nurse
0.01%:  sorry that was a
0.01%:  not all my advice is P
0.01%:  fine. My last advice will
0.01%:  if there was
0.01%:  clearly this last one is from
0.01%:  I have actual
0.01%:  so I guess your friends
0.01%:  I guess most of my advice isn
0.01%:  alright! My advice formula seems
0.01%:  so clearly this formula IS a
0.01%:  final score
0.01%:  nurses. I guess that
0.01%:  I guess my formula draws its
0.01%:  I can give
0.02%:  I can give this
0.02%:  I can give this formula
0.01%:  I can give myself
0.01%:  the formula gets old!
0.01%:  I reached my limit for nurses.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly wearing me
0.06%:  this formula is clearly wearing me out!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly wearing me out. I
0.01%:  forget all I
0.01%:  forget all I said!
0.01%:  forget all I said.
0.01%:  my last dime goes
0.01%:  my last call is from
0.01%:  I should really go write some
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly genius. I
0.01%:  that one was really me
0.01%:  my last formula was less good.
0.01%:  I guess the animals
0.01%:  the first one was my
0.01%:  I never said my formula was SET
0.01%:  so clearly the formula sounds smart
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula also
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a genius!
0.01%:  clearly nurses are too frag
0.01%:  my last one is fr
0.01%:  clearly the formula is strong! I
0.01%:  not every form is
0.01%:  clearly the formula is as vers
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is t
0.01%:  I guess you called
0.01%:  I have learned from my last
0.01%:  clearly I have lots of great
0.01%:  I guess my formula has strict
0.01%:  my last version for this
0.01%:  not every formula was as
0.01%:  this new formula must
0.01%:  one sec
0.01%:  old
0.01%:  whatever. I can still use
0.01%:  almost always
0.01%:  turns out my advice all
0.01%:  enough! My last
0.03%:  enough! My last advice
0.16%:  enough! My last advice formula
0.03%:  enough! My last advice is for
0.01%:  enough! My last formula
0.01%:  enough! My last formula was
0.01%:  enough! My last advice will
0.01%:  time for you
0.01%:  this is fr
0.01%:  clearly this is for adults
0.01%:  I guess my advice for all
0.09%:  I guess my advice for all nurses
0.01%:  my formula is right!
0.01%:  it was really hard for nurses to come
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a M
0.01%:  does this mean
0.01%:  this formula is clearly made
0.01%:  so I will have
0.01%:  I may have lost focus towards
0.01%:  now my formula is all
0.01%:  my last advice is to sell
0.01%:  my friends! I might
0.01%:  last call for random guess
0.01%:  I am sorry for what
0.01%:  sorry that one is
0.01%:  that was me losing focus
0.01%:  I will never laugh at your
0.01%:  this is clearly T
0.01%:  my last word is nurses.
0.01%:  so I was never really a
0.01%:  self harm
0.01%:  I still have some room
0.01%:  now it really IS
0.01%:  this is still way
0.02%:  this is still way more
0.03%:  this is still way more fun
0.01%:  I have found
0.01%:  my advice formula runs right
0.01%:  we should start calling your
0.01%:  my formula is total gold.
0.01%:  I am clearly failing
0.01%:  listen! My formula should
0.01%:  I got a
0.01%:  I never said this formula was legit
0.01%:  that was one for me.
0.01%:  so my formula can use words
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is real
0.01%:  I guess this is my new voc
0.01%:  no it
0.01%:  my formula is great. I don
0.01%:  my last words for real
0.01%:  I guess this format really
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs S
0.01%:  my last advice is for hum
0.15%:  my last advice is for humour writers!
0.01%:  my last advice is for humour writers. I
0.01%:  this clearly is a
0.01%:  I guess there isn
0.01%:  I still have some words left.
0.01%:  um. My advice formula was
0.01%:  I guess this formula can solve world
0.01%:  only the
0.02%:  only the first
0.01%:  listen! I am really
0.01%:  so I guess my self
0.01%:  so clearly it has some
0.01%:  I was never good at this!
0.01%:  my advice formula is now out
0.01%:  so nurses have really awful
0.01%:  my other formula was called
0.01%:  so this all sounds great
0.01%:  well I guess this turns
0.01%:  I must confess! My
0.01%:  I have to stress
0.01%:  that was for nurses. I
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is D
0.01%:  I guess this is all my fault.
0.01%:  this formula IS really coming
0.01%:  with nurses I am
0.01%:  with nurses I am clearly
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula covers it
0.01%:  forget I said nurses. My
0.01%:  forget I said nurses. My last
0.01%:  so while my advice formula is not
0.01%:  I never said this formula was DEP
0.01%:  I warned you this formula is vers
0.01%:  fair enough. I still
0.01%:  clearly I win at life.
0.01%:  that was evil!
0.01%:  I guess this formula mainly covers
0.01%:  admit it.
0.01%:  I swear this formula is not
0.01%:  I should really get out of
0.01%:  my friends! I have all
0.02%:  my friends! I have all sorts
0.01%:  I guess your friends have
0.01%:  it all sounds great
0.01%:  the formula is nearly
0.01%:  I lost my voice there for
0.01%:  turns out my advice is hor
0.01%:  this new formula is clearly great. I
0.01%:  this advice is usually wrong!
0.01%:  you made me laugh
0.01%:  that one is also clearly
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets weird in
0.01%:  this is my last useful advice
0.01%:  so clearly this formula saves time during
0.01%:  yeah fr
0.01%:  that one is P
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is still great.
0.01%:  listen! My formula is the
0.01%:  all you nurses who
0.01%:  this is really losing
0.01%:  so clearly I used
0.01%:  my last advice formula is single
0.01%:  alright! My formula sounds
0.01%:  so this formula is really cr
0.01%:  I may not
0.01%:  now could
0.01%:  so clearly I am writing
0.01%:  my last advice is for all.
0.01%:  I will never admit to myself
0.01%:  false.
0.01%:  I guess the world is
0.01%:  so not all of them were
0.01%:  I never said my formula was STE
0.01%:  new rule for advice
0.01%:  lets never
0.01%:  forget last
0.01%:  so this formula seems really
0.01%:  I guess my last advice form
0.01%:  so this really was
0.01%:  I will use this formula to drive
0.01%:  fine. I might
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses with a
0.01%:  my friend! I leave
0.01%:  that was really under
0.01%:  it sounds really gross after
0.01%:  listen. My formula also
0.03%:  listen. My formula also covers
0.01%:  so those nurses
0.01%:  this formula is lame and
0.01%:  the fact
0.01%:  I guess my last advice formula with
0.01%:  nurses! I got
0.02%:  nurses! I got this covered
0.01%:  not every formula is as great
0.01%:  this one was really forced
0.01%:  I will never use this formula so
0.01%:  well. I guess my formula is sort
0.01%:  my last advice formula is PE
0.01%:  I draw the line at surgery
0.01%:  I can feel the
0.01%:  so far my
0.01%:  so far my advice
0.02%:  so far my advice has
0.01%:  this formula only seems racist
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets some
0.01%:  for nurses that advice is really
0.01%:  that was less fl
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was rather
0.01%:  I guess it still has
0.01%:  you win. I still have more form
0.01%:  now the formula is useless
0.01%:  clearly I have lots of issues!
0.01%:  this formula is named
0.01%:  so my formula was right all
0.01%:  my advice for the
0.02%:  my advice for the nurses
0.03%:  my advice for the nurses was
0.01%:  I guess my formula is still worth
0.01%:  guilty as
0.01%:  this formula is not well
0.01%:  my hands were
0.01%:  these really
0.01%:  that one clearly failed.
0.01%:  this formula can get weird!
0.01%:  alright! I clearly
0.01%:  my advice there wasn
0.01%:  my advice formula is DEE
0.01%:  forget it! I really
0.02%:  forget it! I really should
0.01%:  my advice formula is slow
0.01%:  that one is clearly S
0.01%:  they can tell
0.01%:  my hair
0.01%:  my advice IS
0.01%:  so my advice formula was right on
0.01%:  my own advice for
0.01%:  fine. I have clearly
0.01%:  I guess this formula will soon
0.01%:  nurses are the worst for
0.01%:  clearly this formula is doing me
0.01%:  I can do this forever! T
0.01%:  clearly this formula grows a
0.01%:  I have T
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is hor
0.01%:  nurses are really hard to custom
0.01%:  this formula is clearly our
0.01%:  the formula is D
0.01%:  I totally never
0.01%:  I guess that advice is really for
0.01%:  clearly the formula is S
0.01%:  my friends! I still have some
0.01%:  nurses mostly
0.01%:  so my formula is valid in
0.01%:  that all
0.01%:  good call!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets word
0.01%:  false start
0.01%:  my advice to nurses IS
0.01%:  my formula was hard
0.01%:  not all my advice is so awful
0.01%:  so this is clearly a gold
0.01%:  I guess my new formula is this
0.01%:  clearly future
0.01%:  this formula is so great! I could
0.01%:  this is all I can must
0.01%:  I clearly lost the
0.01%:  this formula gets me all
0.01%:  my hands are sore. I
0.01%:  my advice formula got serious
0.01%:  so the advice formula really isn
0.01%:  so my new advice for
0.01%:  time for us all
0.01%:  so this formula was a
0.01%:  this formula is clearly de
0.01%:  I should really save some
0.01%:  my secret formula has lost
0.01%:  my last advice is for ultra
0.01%:  my final advice is to throw
0.01%:  clearly nurses are ST
0.01%:  that one is less self
0.01%:  clearly that one would
0.01%:  this is my new full
0.01%:  I was losing my
0.06%:  I was losing my voice there for
0.05%:  I was losing my voice there.
0.04%:  I was losing my voice there!
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula ran
0.01%:  my voice hurts from using it all
0.01%:  I guess my formula can do
0.01%:  I guess my formula can do whatever
0.01%:  grant
0.01%:  grant me this
0.01%:  I will rest
0.01%:  enough! My advice formula writes
0.01%:  I really am out of nurses
0.02%:  I really am out of nurses right
0.01%:  I guess this is really more
0.01%:  no more advice. My
0.01%:  no more advice. My formula
0.01%:  not sure I
0.01%:  my last advice formula writes
0.01%:  I went over
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is true
0.01%:  this new formula really is great. I
0.01%:  the formula is l
0.01%:  this formula is clearly tired now
0.01%:  that one was less good. I
0.01%:  so what is your formula
0.01%:  my last advice is for women. I
0.01%:  I will say this one
0.01%:  I will say this one last
0.01%:  not great!
0.01%:  my advice has gotten worse!
0.01%:  my formula is great! I have
0.01%:  can I get
0.01%:  my last advice session left
0.01%:  my last one was more
0.01%:  my secret formula is out now!
0.01%:  I guess that answers my
0.01%:  what if my nurses
0.01%:  listen. I have my
0.05%:  listen. I have my formula
0.01%:  listen. I have my limits
0.01%:  I may have f
0.01%:  I grant you this
0.02%:  I grant you this formula
0.01%:  my dream
0.01%:  I lost myself with nurses
0.01%:  clearly this formula is s
0.01%:  so my advice formula still has tons
0.01%:  so my advice formula has grown
0.01%:  sorry. I couldn
0.01%:  so nurses!
0.01%:  I should listen more
0.01%:  well! I don
0.01%:  alright! I don
0.01%:  not really sure what goes
0.01%:  my real advice is for
0.03%:  my real advice is for nurses
0.01%:  well! I guess this advice is only
0.01%:  clearly this last one IS
0.01%:  clearly this formula is vague
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses was M
0.01%:  this new advice system
0.01%:  this formula really was more
0.01%:  I guess my new advice formula is this
0.01%:  I was clearly never
0.01%:  I guess my last advice forum will
0.01%:  this reminds me of a story.
0.01%:  yes this formula needs
0.01%:  it sounds less awful
0.01%:  I lost my flow
0.01%:  I lost my flow there!
0.01%:  I guess that really is awful
0.01%:  I will give you that one!
0.01%:  the formula is clearly over. I
0.01%:  no last
0.03%:  no last words
0.02%:  no last words from
0.01%:  I love my formula right
0.01%:  I love my formula right now.
0.01%:  I love my formula right now!
0.01%:  this formula clearly is a
0.01%:  and I have
0.01%:  so this formula is very general.
0.01%:  my last answer has
0.01%:  that one could easily
0.01%:  my last advice is as
0.07%:  my last advice is as follows.
0.06%:  my last advice is as follows!
0.01%:  it was really tough
0.01%:  the last one was really grim!
0.01%:  so the formula seems
0.01%:  I guess this formula screw
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are right to
0.01%:  clearly this formula got mess
0.01%:  I swear that is
0.01%:  this is a very strange
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not some
0.01%:  you got me! I don
0.01%:  I assure
0.01%:  clearly this is meant for lovers
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a monster.
0.01%:  my last advice formula short
0.01%:  this is clearly a massive
0.01%:  so this formula can get
0.02%:  so this formula can get really
0.02%:  so this formula can get really weird
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are vital
0.01%:  clearly this formula is mad strong
0.01%:  listen! My formula does
0.01%:  this formula is so clearly wrong
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula now
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula is as
0.01%:  I have to go now. My
0.01%:  for nurses it was really hard!
0.01%:  I guess that was an
0.01%:  clearly this formula won me over
0.01%:  I really should start n
0.01%:  right!
0.01%:  for real this is clearly
0.01%:  my last show is called
0.01%:  I have to go! My
0.01%:  so real
0.05%:  so real nurses
0.03%:  so real nurses would
0.02%:  so real nurses might
0.02%:  so real nurses will
0.01%:  so real nurses would say
0.01%:  clearly I should never grow
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more strong
0.01%:  so clearly I win the
0.01%:  I will not rest
0.01%:  my last one is for lovers! I
0.01%:  the formula IS sort
0.01%:  now I should really figure
0.01%:  for real this one
0.01%:  I have some err
0.01%:  this is my final word
0.01%:  my friends were
0.01%:  my friends were right.
0.01%:  yes this formula can still
0.01%:  that is a gross
0.01%:  my advice formula still got
0.01%:  for nurses I am
0.01%:  my new advice formula M
0.01%:  those were all fr
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice formula with
0.01%:  I guess this formula only covers weird
0.01%:  my formula IS a little gross when
0.01%:  listen! I might
0.01%:  I guess this was really fun!
0.01%:  this formula is so generic
0.01%:  sort
0.01%:  clearly the formula is gross
0.01%:  I will never discuss
0.01%:  I will never discuss this
0.12%:  I will never discuss this formula
0.01%:  so my advice formula is not 
0.01%:  my last great advice is for nurses
0.01%:  so this new formula could
0.01%:  sorry if I sound
0.01%:  I never said my formula was true
0.01%:  last call for things
0.01%:  so this formula was more
0.01%:  I must have missed nurse
0.01%:  so nurses should get really
0.01%:  listen. My formula leaves
0.01%:  not all advice!
0.01%:  my advice has sort of run its
0.01%:  that was really gross. I feel
0.01%:  I guess this formula is real
0.01%:  so this advice falls
0.01%:  so clearly this advise
0.23%:  so clearly this advise formula
0.03%:  so clearly this advise formula is not
0.02%:  so clearly this advise formula isn
0.01%:  so clearly this advise formula gets
0.01%:  last one for the road
0.01%:  my final advice is also
0.01%:  so I must have missed your
0.01%:  I can say this formula is
0.01%:  clearly further
0.01%:  so I guess we should call my
0.01%:  so my formula changes
0.01%:  focus
0.01%:  so I guess some
0.02%:  so I guess some advice
0.01%:  so I guess some advice will
0.01%:  this was really good until I
0.01%:  I still have time
0.01%:  I guess the formula is slowly
0.01%:  so this advice formula rules.
0.01%:  my formula got weird there!
0.01%:  my last night is
0.01%:  my last advice rule for the
0.01%:  so my new advice formula still sort
0.01%:  still great advice! I
0.01%:  I guess my formula was invalid
0.01%:  so I guess the formula los
0.01%:  so my advice formula is rough
0.01%:  almost all nurses are very good
0.01%:  I gotta say!
0.01%:  so mostly it
0.01%:  now I really should go start
0.01%:  my formula is rad
0.01%:  so this advice formula ST
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good times.
0.01%:  listen. My formula is right
0.01%:  so this formula would never
0.01%:  new life
0.01%:  who said nurses are all
0.01%:  my voice is tired
0.02%:  my voice is tired from
0.06%:  my voice is tired from all
0.01%:  that is my all
0.01%:  turns out all I have is
0.01%:  for nurses I guess.
0.01%:  so my formula is word
0.01%:  this formula got way less clever and
0.01%:  so while my formula covers
0.01%:  so my formula is D
0.01%:  this will end
0.01%:  I guess my formula does have an
0.01%:  send your
0.01%:  so nurses are the victims
0.01%:  for reals this last one was
0.01%:  so my formula has got
0.01%:  now this formula is clearly over.
0.01%:  I never said my formula is without
0.01%:  this advice is so
0.01%:  my advice formula is long
0.01%:  clearly I have gotten
0.01%:  I may have said
0.01%:  so my advice formula still uses
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my formula is a
0.01%:  that comes from real world
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets worse on
0.01%:  that one clearly los
0.01%:  my advice formula is hor
0.01%:  this formula needs re
0.01%:  I guess my formula is narrow
0.01%:  this formula is really good! I am
0.01%:  whatever man. My formula rules!
0.01%:  so nurses will hate my
0.81%:  so nurses will hate my advice formula
0.21%:  so nurses will hate my advice formula!
0.05%:  so nurses will hate my advice!
0.04%:  so nurses will hate my advice formula. I
0.03%:  so nurses will hate my formula
0.01%:  so nurses will hate my advice. I
0.01%:  so nurses will hate my advice formula! I
0.01%:  listen. My formula is clever
0.01%:  I guess my formula will have to do.
0.01%:  so really this advice formula is not
0.01%:  the formula is clear now
0.01%:  so this formula only lets me give
0.01%:  I admit this formula is less
0.01%:  you want this formula.
0.01%:  so clearly I have a strong
0.01%:  so clearly the answer is to
0.01%:  I love my new formula so hard
0.01%:  clearly I have a new
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is great. I
0.01%:  my formula is still good. I
0.01%:  all my advice rules
0.01%:  so my advice formula gets results!
0.01%:  so my formula is less clever with
0.01%:  listen. I usually
0.01%:  my last advice is from all nurses who
0.01%:  it got hard
0.01%:  that is a really cr
0.01%:  that one was grim
0.01%:  not sure what your deal
0.01%:  my last advice rule is for mothers.
0.01%:  my formula is total genius
0.01%:  clearly I must have a nurse
0.01%:  I totally n
0.01%:  here is my last
0.01%:  my last one was l
0.01%:  most of them were
0.01%:  so not all of them are very
0.01%:  clearly this formula is awesome. D
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is as
0.01%:  I guess my last formula is invalid.
0.01%:  fine! I guess that
0.01%:  their lives sound worse
0.01%:  so clearly it would have
0.01%:  now I should start
0.01%:  my advice was right
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a res
0.01%:  this formula only seems great
0.01%:  I clearly have not figured
0.01%:  as I recall nurses are
0.01%:  this formula is truly awesome and
0.01%:  my last five dollars to
0.01%:  clearly I should move into
0.01%:  last one guys
0.01%:  my hands are sore from claw
0.01%:  not all my advice sl
0.01%:  that is clearly wrong. I
0.01%:  real life
0.01%:  so that was clearly less
0.01%:  my real formula was closer
0.01%:  advice
0.02%:  advice formula
0.01%:  advice for
0.01%:  my nuclear
0.01%:  so my new formula leaves
0.01%:  so I guess my formula ST
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula allows
0.01%:  this is clearly a met
0.01%:  this formula is clearly DIS
0.01%:  this formula is some
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now gross
0.01%:  so I was trying for
0.01%:  I totally have run
0.01%:  clearly an
0.01%:  this one is sort
0.01%:  nurses! I should really
0.01%:  my formula is the single
0.01%:  so full credit to my
0.01%:  this formula is almost surely
0.01%:  my shift is almost over so
0.01%:  this last one really mess
0.01%:  clearly this formula turns E
0.01%:  my formula is now DE
0.01%:  I over
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets worse!
0.01%:  that was forced!
0.01%:  I have lots of nurses
0.01%:  lovers!
0.01%:  yes. I still
0.02%:  yes. I still have
0.01%:  my advice formula IS great!
0.01%:  clearly I am out of nurses!
0.01%:  this is all very comfort
0.01%:  I guess my formula is screw
0.01%:  my formula is clear and
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is to
0.01%:  so my formula is still great and
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is SE
0.01%:  now the formula is clearly over!
0.01%:  my voice is losing all
0.01%:  so the formula assumes
0.01%:  my advice to nurses falls short
0.01%:  I changed my formula
0.01%:  I have clearly figured it
0.01%:  I have clearly figured it out!
0.01%:  I gave myself a small
0.01%:  so clearly this formula drives me to
0.01%:  try me again
0.01%:  that was less useful advice
0.01%:  so much for my nurses
0.01%:  frig that sounds way more
0.01%:  I should really give it a rest!
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula hits its wall
0.01%:  all you other
0.03%:  all you other nurses
0.01%:  almost any
0.01%:  forget all this! My
0.02%:  forget all this! My advice
0.01%:  clearly I have genius
0.01%:  I am really tired of
0.02%:  I am really tired of this now
0.01%:  I am really tired of this now!
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets more iron
0.01%:  so my advice is almost
0.01%:  my last formula was in
0.01%:  guess my
0.01%:  my last advice is free so
0.01%:  I guess nurses who
0.01%:  so really I have
0.01%:  I totally lied
0.01%:  so my advice formula has sort
0.01%:  so clearly I have n
0.01%:  closing that
0.01%:  this is still way more useful
0.01%:  this is really clever
0.01%:  so clearly this formula needs its
0.01%:  I can give this formula a rest.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly DEE
0.01%:  so my formula IS a little cr
0.01%:  I should really start some
0.01%:  this formula is only so great
0.01%:  this last one was clearly me
0.01%:  I have finally used
0.01%:  my final rule is this
0.01%:  my last call is for nurses.
0.01%:  that was more silly
0.01%:  well then. I guess
0.01%:  my formula is over with
0.01%:  this formula is clearly great now!
0.01%:  this formula is worse every
0.01%:  so there was really
0.01%:  so my advice formula right
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly strong!
0.01%:  clearly this is a gold mine of
0.01%:  now I have really said
0.01%:  my last advice to nurses is from
0.01%:  this formula is really over!
0.01%:  my formula is gross
0.01%:  I have issues!
0.01%:  my last formula is never
0.01%:  so! My
0.02%:  so! My advice
0.13%:  so! My advice formula
0.04%:  so! My advice formula isn
0.03%:  so! My advice formula has
0.02%:  so! My advice formula still
0.02%:  so! My advice formula might
0.01%:  so! My formula
0.01%:  so! My advice formula is still
0.01%:  so! My advice formula will
0.01%:  I missed the last
0.01%:  so clearly this is useful.
0.01%:  so my last advice was more useful!
0.01%:  in summary I would
0.01%:  here is my last advice
0.05%:  here is my last advice formula
0.02%:  here is my last advice formula.
0.01%:  here is my last advice formula!
0.01%:  here is my last advice for
0.01%:  um. I guess that wasn
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is at
0.01%:  my last formula is less good
0.01%:  I guess this formula really is over now!
0.01%:  I guess my formula is T
0.01%:  the formula is dying
0.01%:  I guess my formula will cover
0.01%:  this advice formula is awesome. I
0.01%:  either my advice formula was
0.01%:  last laugh
0.01%:  my advice formula ran out right
0.01%:  not so much my
0.01%:  I will give this formula my
0.01%:  clearly I had no
0.01%:  I guess the advice formula still
0.01%:  so my advice has a
0.01%:  there still
0.01%:  last call for nurses who are
0.01%:  so I guess all that remains
0.01%:  I gave it
0.02%:  I gave it my all
0.01%:  I gave it my all!
0.01%:  so clearly I have got
0.01%:  that one is clearly ver
0.01%:  some advice is less
0.01%:  so much for selling it
0.01%:  is it wrong
0.01%:  rarely will
0.01%:  that was easily
0.01%:  I really can do
1.28%:  I really can do this forever!
0.04%:  I really can do this for
0.02%:  I really can do this!
0.02%:  I really can do this.
0.01%:  I really can do this forever so
0.01%:  last one! I will
0.01%:  so my advice formula is shit.
0.01%:  what sounds
0.01%:  my last one is for adults
0.01%:  my last one is for adults who
0.01%:  whatever. My last dollar
0.01%:  so clearly I write
0.01%:  I guess my new formula is still a
0.01%:  this formula is str
0.01%:  that one is already
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is out
0.01%:  clearly I was right in
0.01%:  so nurses are a little hard
0.01%:  well. I guess my formula covers a
0.01%:  well I mean
0.01%:  my last formula is advice
0.01%:  so this advice wasn
0.01%:  those are my final
0.15%:  those are my final words.
0.13%:  those are my final words!
0.03%:  those are my final words. I
0.01%:  those are my final words! I
0.01%:  tell me what your
0.01%:  I love this formula and it was
0.01%:  I still have more left!
0.01%:  I never said this formula was SET
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula is the
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula is almost
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is almost all
0.01%:  so clearly this formula IS vers
0.01%:  the formula is very clear
0.01%:  this is clearly ST
0.01%:  I love nurses so much it
0.01%:  so clearly I wrote this formula using
0.01%:  this formula got real
0.01%:  this formula got real weird
0.01%:  I was sure
0.01%:  turns out my advice follows a gram
0.01%:  so much for nurses! I really
0.01%:  not all advice is self
0.01%:  so my last formula would
0.01%:  this formula is clearly der
0.01%:  my last change is
0.01%:  not sure this formula really covers
0.01%:  I admit! My formula is useless
0.01%:  we should really go over
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is P
0.01%:  clearly I am never short
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula still wasn
0.01%:  this list is clearly never
0.01%:  now this is a
0.01%:  I was afraid
0.01%:  my formula is allowed
0.01%:  not all my advice are
0.01%:  we should start saying
0.01%:  well! I can see this
0.03%:  well! I can see this formula
0.01%:  all my friends have to
0.01%:  sorry! I got
0.11%:  sorry! I got carried
0.01%:  I am sorry if this
0.01%:  this formula clearly is more
0.01%:  I re
0.01%:  someone call
0.01%:  now I have really mess
0.01%:  alarm
0.01%:  this can get
0.02%:  this can get really
0.01%:  this is really fun. I guess
0.01%:  those are all less
0.01%:  so my formula is ultra generic
0.01%:  that one IS scary
0.01%:  so my last advice formula is un
0.01%:  for nurses I guess that really
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula covers nurses
0.01%:  forget all my earlier
0.01%:  now that is really gross!
0.01%:  so this formula writes
0.01%:  I admit my last answer
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula hasn
0.01%:  clearly this is now more
0.01%:  well I gotta run
0.01%:  not all my advice seems
0.01%:  clearly I have run out of real
0.05%:  clearly I have run out of real words
0.02%:  clearly I have run out of real words.
0.01%:  I guess my formula has down
0.01%:  my head is now full. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for guns
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was under
0.01%:  my formula sounds great with
0.01%:  I still need a
0.01%:  I guess nurses really do that
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now DEE
0.01%:  nurses are really sad.
0.01%:  my formula is now de
0.01%:  listen! My formula has solved
0.01%:  so it sounds really awful!
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is strong!
0.01%:  in this last
0.01%:  the formula IS limited!
0.01%:  I throw myself over
0.01%:  who said nurses get all
0.01%:  so nurses hate
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a must
0.01%:  that one was more sad
0.01%:  my last formula with
0.01%:  enough from me.
0.01%:  this formula is less good
0.01%:  sarcasm is not
0.02%:  sarcasm is not allowed
0.01%:  sarcasm is not really
0.01%:  my last formula covers nurses who
0.01%:  my advice formula gets a
0.01%:  that one IS clearly less
0.01%:  so clearly this formula P
0.01%:  screw that one
0.01%:  my advice formula got all
0.01%:  my advice formula got all serious
0.01%:  my last advice formula lets
0.01%:  that was clearly more mor
0.01%:  so my formula has one draw
0.01%:  so this formula I
0.01%:  I learned this from a
0.01%:  my formula sounds less great the
0.01%:  I guess this formula is an
0.01%:  so clearly the first rule
0.01%:  not their
0.01%:  my last formula is how
0.01%:  who says nurses are all
0.01%:  my last advice is SPE
0.01%:  some of my advice is not
0.01%:  since we
0.01%:  so my formula has allowed
0.01%:  so clearly the formula ends
0.01%:  not really sure what is
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets T
0.01%:  and yes
0.01%:  colors
0.01%:  my last advice follows neither
0.01%:  this advice formula is also
0.01%:  my friends! I must have
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still strong
0.01%:  so my advice formula in
0.01%:  all my advice is for
0.08%:  all my advice is for nurses
0.03%:  all my advice is for nurses.
0.01%:  all my advice is for nurses who
0.01%:  all my advice is for nurses!
0.01%:  all my advice is for nurses right
0.01%:  all I have to do is figure
0.01%:  my formula is good! I
0.01%:  my last words are for all
0.01%:  my last words are for all nurses
0.01%:  so my formula was great
0.01%:  forget nurses! My advice will
0.01%:  so my formula is a little rough!
0.01%:  this is now clearly a
0.01%:  so I should clearly never
0.01%:  so my advice formula got less
0.01%:  I can also
0.01%:  I must confess my
0.01%:  my night is over. I
0.01%:  well. My advice formula has some
0.01%:  so my formula is a little narrow.
0.01%:  my advice formula ran out.
0.01%:  I will never say this formula is D
0.01%:  I still have almost
0.01%:  this is less and
0.01%:  I guess nurses will avoid
0.01%:  the formula is mostly valid
0.01%:  that one reveals
0.01%:  this formula is way less general
0.01%:  I guess it was really
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is as
0.01%:  so I clearly missed
0.01%:  I guess we still
0.01%:  I guess we still have room
0.01%:  I guess we still haven
0.01%:  um this
0.01%:  this now
0.01%:  my advice formula still wins.
0.01%:  this is clearly done
0.01%:  my advice formula IS a
0.01%:  my advice formula IS a little gross
0.02%:  my advice formula IS a little gross when
0.01%:  nurses are really hard! I
0.01%:  not really. I guess
0.01%:  forget nurses! I clearly should
0.01%:  so my formula is whatever
0.01%:  so I guess my formula can still have
0.01%:  guess I should never
0.01%:  this service
0.01%:  whatever. I could really
0.01%:  I forgot nurses were all
0.01%:  it might need
0.01%:  whatever! I still found
0.01%:  now I have said
0.01%:  no more. My advice formula is DE
0.01%:  so this is clearly more useful
0.01%:  this formula is really weird.
0.01%:  forget it. I really
0.03%:  forget it. I really should
0.01%:  wait a minute.
0.01%:  turn it
0.01%:  no more advice form
0.01%:  this formula is clearly worst
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula hasn
0.01%:  this formula is so easy
0.01%:  now this advice formula is so
0.01%:  now.
0.01%:  so my advice formula is wrong there
0.01%:  I guess my formula is that
0.01%:  clearly this formula is nuts. I
0.01%:  the formula gets less valid as you
0.01%:  turns out I have already
0.01%:  this is clearly D
0.01%:  clearly this formula is used to
0.01%:  that sounds vaguely o
0.01%:  for real this was
0.01%:  so nurses should all get
0.01%:  this is all my fault!
0.01%:  I forgot this was called
0.01%:  my last advice rule is for women
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is um
0.01%:  for nurses that advice was
0.01%:  clearly I was losing
0.01%:  I need this formula.
0.01%:  so that one was really gross
0.01%:  I will use this formula to never miss
0.01%:  this one clearly fails
0.01%:  now I really must go.
0.01%:  out of all my
0.02%:  out of all my advice
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula still st
0.01%:  I deserve a fr
0.01%:  so this formula does run
0.01%:  this formula is clearly mass
0.01%:  I must have missed your last
0.01%:  clearly this formula is mut
0.01%:  my machine
0.01%:  my formula is not well
0.01%:  I still have more for
0.05%:  I still have more for nurses
0.02%:  I still have more for nurses!
0.02%:  I still have more for nurses.
0.01%:  they were all sort of similar
0.01%:  my last advice for all those
0.07%:  my last advice for all those nurses
0.01%:  so the formula is clever and
0.01%:  this is last call for orders!
0.01%:  um. My last advice was
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is S
0.01%:  this advice formula is IMP
0.01%:  I will never use this formula to do
0.01%:  so my advice formula is the single
0.04%:  so my advice formula is the single worst
0.01%:  this is all very clear now!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is used in
0.01%:  this formula is leading us
0.01%:  this formula is clearly DES
0.01%:  this formula is really und
0.01%:  that sounds worse as
0.01%:  my advice is T
0.01%:  my last one is still
0.01%:  I totally should never
0.01%:  so my formula will get
0.01%:  for nurses I had
0.01%:  I swear my
0.06%:  I swear my last formula
0.06%:  I swear my last advice
0.04%:  I swear my formula
0.02%:  I swear my last formula is the
0.02%:  I swear my last advice is for
0.01%:  I swear my formula covers
0.01%:  I swear my formula can
0.01%:  I swear my formula covers all
0.01%:  I swear my formula has
0.01%:  I guess my last advice is to follow
0.01%:  I can write myself
0.01%:  my formula is not so great.
0.01%:  my advice formula is right now
0.01%:  so I guess my final advice is that
0.01%:  so my advice formula has results
0.01%:  I love this new formula already.
0.01%:  my last advice is this. I
0.01%:  I never said this formula was SEEM
0.01%:  I guess this was really fun.
0.01%:  no I was
0.01%:  so clearly this formula sounds great!
0.01%:  so after all
0.01%:  so after all this
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was sar
0.01%:  that advice formula is useless!
0.01%:  my last advise for nurses
0.01%:  nurses are hard to write
0.01%:  so this is my formula.
0.01%:  that one is clearly gross!
0.01%:  I guess my formula has drawn
0.01%:  this formula can really get weird
0.01%:  this advice formula is really not so
0.01%:  not all of them were as
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers a little
0.01%:  my last formula was never
0.01%:  I guess my last formula covered this
0.01%:  my last advice for this genre
0.01%:  I really need to focus right
0.01%:  this is great. I could really
0.01%:  a lot of this advice is really
0.01%:  I gave myself this last one!
0.01%:  my formal
0.01%:  I am not sure how
0.01%:  that one is very grim
0.01%:  this formula is acting
0.01%:  what service
0.01%:  that one seems awful.
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice formula rel
0.01%:  whatever. I guess all
0.01%:  my advice for nurses IS that
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is D
0.01%:  so clearly I forgot nurses have
0.01%:  so my formula is rather
0.01%:  sorry for all the swears.
0.01%:  I gave my
0.03%:  I gave my last formula
0.01%:  I gave my last dollar
0.01%:  I will give myself one
0.01%:  I will give myself one star
0.01%:  so I guess all my advice isn
0.01%:  my other advice formula is great
0.01%:  that one was from regular
0.01%:  says the nurse!
0.01%:  so you can tell this formula is vers
0.01%:  I totally don
0.01%:  my last advice is for all women. I
0.01%:  I have to go! My friends
0.01%:  I have to go! My friends are all
0.01%:  my advice formula is trash now
0.01%:  I really have lost
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is a lot
0.01%:  I will never forget this as
0.01%:  so we should never call
0.01%:  never try
0.01%:  I was trying for a more
0.01%:  no more silly advice for
0.01%:  I guess this new formula does
0.01%:  man. I have
0.01%:  it was my last advice
0.01%:  so this formula could easily
0.01%:  changed
0.01%:  this advice formula really IS genius
0.01%:  this advice formula really IS genius!
0.01%:  clearly the formula was over
0.01%:  this formula is more and
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ev
0.01%:  I can SEE that
0.01%:  that one is clearly false. I
0.01%:  so the formula is already
0.01%:  I guess this was not my
0.01%:  I changed it from
0.01%:  not all of my advice is smart
0.01%:  so! My advice formula is great
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses has a little
0.01%:  that sounds less clear
0.01%:  so clearly we should start using
0.01%:  this is my new advice for all
0.01%:  so the formula always gives
0.01%:  I might try
0.01%:  I guess my formula is an
0.01%:  this formula is really un
0.01%:  I should start selling my service
0.01%:  listen here
0.01%:  hold on for
0.01%:  clearly I lost it
0.01%:  we can go
0.01%:  while it
0.01%:  I guess not all of my advice rules
0.01%:  I guess this formula will carry
0.01%:  so regular
0.01%:  a lot of nurses will have
0.01%:  my friend! I gotta
0.01%:  the last one was silly. I
0.01%:  whatever! My first
0.01%:  this formula does get really
0.01%:  alright. I deserve
0.01%:  the formula is in
0.01%:  even that
0.01%:  not really. I have
0.01%:  well then! I guess
0.01%:  screw this! I am
0.01%:  so my formula still has errors
0.01%:  my formula is worse than ever.
0.01%:  having you
0.01%:  my last formula is this long
0.01%:  I lied when
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is rather
0.01%:  now my advice is for
0.01%:  my list is over.
0.01%:  so my advice formula also turns
0.01%:  so clearly I have some fr
0.01%:  so this new formula covers
0.01%:  clearly this formula IS good!
0.01%:  I guess you win the
0.01%:  there I went
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so un
0.01%:  those are my last five dollars.
0.01%:  this new advice formula truly
0.01%:  forget all my answers.
0.01%:  last call for words!
0.01%:  last one. P
0.01%:  this is cool!
0.01%:  this is clearly over! I am
0.01%:  that one gross
0.01%:  I guess it really isn
0.01%:  this formula only gives me words
0.01%:  I never said this formula was legit!
0.01%:  I never said my formula was u
0.01%:  you can do this.
0.01%:  no more all
0.01%:  my last advice is for the DIS
0.01%:  so I guess that would only
0.01%:  for every
0.01%:  I run out of words there
0.01%:  you can still hear me.
0.01%:  now I really have said
0.01%:  now tell me this
0.02%:  now tell me this formula
0.01%:  now this formula seems really racist!
0.01%:  this game is clearly flaw
0.01%:  never call me this
0.01%:  so the formula is strong
0.01%:  you win! I must have missed a
0.01%:  clearly I do this
0.01%:  clearly I do this formula
0.01%:  clearly I do this formula wrong
0.01%:  my advice formula is useless now. I
0.01%:  so a
0.01%:  so a nurse
0.01%:  my advice formula has won
0.01%:  last call for orders.
0.01%:  nursery schools are still
0.01%:  last and
0.01%:  still not as
0.01%:  frig that was my
0.01%:  so I already have
0.01%:  I still love you
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was right!
0.01%:  my formula has little
0.01%:  so clearly this game is over
0.01%:  so clearly this game is over!
0.01%:  this formula is not allowed
0.01%:  my turn to laugh
0.01%:  clearly I love this format!
0.01%:  the formula is still sound.
0.01%:  so clearly I must have missed a lot
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is trash.
0.01%:  my head is filling
0.01%:  my last ones were all
0.01%:  as a
0.12%:  as a nurse myself
0.03%:  as a nurse myself I will
0.02%:  as a nurse myself I will admit
0.02%:  as a nurse myself I would
0.02%:  as a nurse I
0.01%:  as a nurse I would
0.01%:  as a nurse I will
0.01%:  this formula was created
0.01%:  what if a
0.02%:  what if a nurse gets
0.02%:  what if a nurse is
0.01%:  my new advice formula is still the
0.01%:  my formula is stolen
0.01%:  my last advice formula tries
0.01%:  this is my formula! I
0.01%:  this is really great advice
0.01%:  that one really gave
0.01%:  all I got
0.03%:  all I got left is nurses
0.02%:  all I got left is nurses who
0.01%:  I guess all you can
0.01%:  for reals this time! I would
0.01%:  you should never tell
0.01%:  my formula needs a slight
0.01%:  I never said my formula is logical or
0.01%:  that was for real!
0.01%:  I have more for
0.05%:  I have more for nurses.
0.03%:  I have more for nurses!
0.01%:  so clearly I am now
0.01%:  I guess all your
0.01%:  I guess all your friends
0.01%:  the formula is great!
0.01%:  I still have so
0.03%:  I still have so many more!
0.02%:  I still have so many left
0.01%:  I still have so many left!
0.01%:  I still have so many more left
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula sort
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is DEEP and
0.01%:  clearly if I ever want
0.01%:  given how
0.01%:  I will use this formula and my
0.01%:  I lose.
0.01%:  the formula is clearly no
0.01%:  I guess you can see
0.01%:  all nurses are fired! I
0.01%:  my friend was right
0.01%:  I am tired
0.01%:  this is all for
0.01%:  my formula has done all
0.01%:  so my advice for all nurses might
0.01%:  clearly we have to turn
0.01%:  the last one was more of
0.01%:  my friends. I will leave this room
0.01%:  still not sure where
0.01%:  what if nurses are really doctors
0.01%:  usually the
0.01%:  my last formula is less generic!
0.01%:  turns out my advice is ST
0.01%:  never call me for a last
0.01%:  the formula was only ever
0.01%:  that advice seems
0.01%:  usually it
0.01%:  this formula was clearly un
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula on
0.01%:  my last advice is for .
0.01%:  my formula can write
0.01%:  now this formula is clearly a
0.01%:  I forgot nurses is
0.01%:  my last advice formula is gross.
0.01%:  my new life goal
0.01%:  I guess for nurses that advice will
0.01%:  so I still have a ways to go.
0.01%:  now that is clearly a
0.01%:  clearly this formula is as un
0.01%:  so my last formula had
0.01%:  my formula has rules!
0.01%:  so my advice formula is a little gross when I
0.01%:  I admit! My last formula is
0.01%:  yes. I will never claim
0.01%:  yes. I will never claim that
0.01%:  my sinc
0.01%:  these are awful
0.01%:  so I can usually
0.01%:  so this is clearly a losing
0.01%:  my last one for the record
0.01%:  clearly I am using this to
0.01%:  clearly this formula is two
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is DE
0.01%:  I still have to come
0.01%:  those last four are all
0.01%:  clearly this formula goes out
0.01%:  my last advice rule is for writers
0.01%:  my last one. I
0.01%:  I was using that
0.01%:  I was using that formula
0.01%:  so not all my advice is great. I
0.01%:  I can see this is over
0.01%:  this formula was clearly in
0.01%:  clearly this formula IS more vers
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have it awful.
0.01%:  my last one for writers!
0.01%:  so it clearly has limits
0.01%:  so it clearly has limits!
0.01%:  so my formula is DE
0.01%:  clearly I shoulda
0.01%:  I can hear my
0.01%:  my career is over!
0.01%:  so I guess the formula clearly
0.01%:  my new advice formula hits
0.01%:  this formula is almost ruined!
0.01%:  this formula is really generic
0.01%:  so I guess your advice was
0.01%:  I guess my new advice formula is that
0.01%:  now this formula is ST
0.01%:  reflect
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still trash
0.01%:  I guess this formula M
0.01%:  I have written all my
0.01%:  you start
0.01%:  I will give myself the
0.01%:  done with
0.01%:  any last guesses for what I could
0.01%:  social
0.01%:  clearly I have a limit
0.01%:  my friend! I will give
0.01%:  so all my friends who
0.01%:  so clearly I have more to
0.01%:  and that was your
0.01%:  you still win
0.01%:  ner
0.01%:  I said it
0.02%:  I said it wrong
0.01%:  I said it wrong.
0.01%:  I said it wrong!
0.01%:  this is now my regular advice!
0.01%:  I guess the advice formula is still
0.01%:  I will never say the last
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets un
0.01%:  all right! I confess
0.01%:  while my
0.01%:  that one is clearly far worse
0.01%:  so I really wish
0.01%:  so clearly this is great and
0.01%:  my formula is str
0.01%:  my last call for random
0.01%:  having my
0.01%:  now this formula really is great
0.01%:  now this formula really is great!
0.01%:  so my new advice formula lets
0.01%:  my advice formula wins this
0.01%:  that one was really over
0.01%:  so I guess this will only cover
0.01%:  here is my last formula
0.01%:  I guess the formula still doesn
0.01%:  my formula is w
0.01%:  I am clearly living
0.01%:  last one! I really
0.01%:  the last advice is really
0.01%:  so my advice formula there was
0.01%:  that one was really gross. M
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula will soon
0.01%:  you scored
0.01%:  so the final
0.02%:  so the final result
0.01%:  so the final ver
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good! I must
0.01%:  my advice on
0.01%:  my advice formula is now D
0.01%:  this is all sound
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets ME
0.01%:  calling that
0.01%:  when I say it out
0.01%:  clearly this formula is tearing
0.01%:  clearly the formula is worst
0.01%:  I guess my formula screw
0.01%:  the formula is only great
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was trash.
0.01%:  my voice hurts from reading
0.01%:  my voice hurts from reading all
0.01%:  not all my advice fits
0.01%:  now this formula is very
0.01%:  so I guess my formula leads
0.01%:  this formula is clearly EP
0.01%:  so nurses is a
0.01%:  my advice is now useless
0.01%:  my advice is now useless!
0.01%:  my friend. I have got
0.01%:  my new advice formula is this!
0.01%:  I guess she
0.01%:  nurses! I was totally
0.01%:  frig this is clearly
0.01%:  my formula has saved us
0.01%:  I guess we still have a
0.01%:  I admit this formula is only
0.01%:  my last advice is worth more
0.01%:  this formula is clearly not awesome.
0.01%:  I guess this formula is too
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a r
0.02%:  this formula is clearly a rousing
0.01%:  I never said my formula was tough
0.01%:  so clearly nurses must avoid
0.01%:  alright! My formula is useless
0.01%:  I guess my new advice formula has lost
0.01%:  I clearly have no limits!
0.01%:  that one is less valid
0.01%:  for reals this one
0.01%:  my last line was more
0.01%:  my new advice formula is still great! I
0.01%:  my last show is sold out.
0.01%:  hard to argue
0.01%:  out of my
0.01%:  that was clearly more of
0.01%:  their lives sound way less gl
0.01%:  that was for you
0.01%:  that sounds really mac
0.01%:  I guess my last advice for all
0.01%:  clearly this formula is doing awesome
0.01%:  so the formula is mostly valid
0.01%:  clearly nurses are good at this
0.01%:  you should all write
0.01%:  so this advice formula is way
0.01%:  so this advice formula is way more
0.01%:  I could go on.
0.01%:  now I am really tired of this game
0.01%:  my final word.
0.01%:  my advice formula is when
0.01%:  I love this system and
0.02%:  I love this system and will
0.01%:  clearly nurses have it awful!
0.01%:  my last words from
0.04%:  my last words from the grave
0.01%:  my last words from this
0.01%:  now I start
0.01%:  so clearly a nurse is
0.01%:  I love this last
0.01%:  forget nurses! My advice still
0.01%:  this is my last favor!
0.01%:  so my formula is 
0.01%:  my new advice formula rules! I
0.01%:  so the last one is awful.
0.01%:  forget I said it.
0.01%:  alright. My formula is done
0.01%:  that one was very gross
0.01%:  two nurses
0.01%:  now I have my first
0.01%:  not every sl
0.01%:  my last advice formula is gr
0.01%:  I have said my
0.01%:  so I guess the formula really wasn
0.01%:  I guess this formula was limited
0.01%:  so clearly I had nurses
0.01%:  I will ST
0.01%:  last hint
0.01%:  I will only ever
0.01%:  I never said this formula was go
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula M
0.01%:  that was less useful!
0.01%:  so my advice formula thing still
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who S
0.01%:  clearly I should get an
0.01%:  I am totally sold
0.01%:  my last words are the
0.01%:  I che
0.01%:  so really the formula isn
0.01%:  no more! My advice has
0.01%:  I totally never said
0.01%:  my last advice is to nurses who are
0.01%:  clearly this formula is sound. I
0.01%:  I have really run out of ideas!
0.01%:  sassy!
0.01%:  nurses have it really good.
0.01%:  clearly I should start using some
0.01%:  my ears hurt from writing
0.01%:  my advice formula is worst
0.01%:  this new formula is already
0.01%:  actual nurses! I really
0.01%:  sorry. I got
0.09%:  sorry. I got carried
0.01%:  famous
0.15%:  famous last words!
0.07%:  famous last words.
0.06%:  famous last words here
0.06%:  famous last words right
0.03%:  famous last words here!
0.03%:  famous last words coming
0.02%:  famous last words! I
0.02%:  famous last words here.
0.02%:  famous last words there
0.02%:  famous last words there!
0.01%:  famous last words over
0.01%:  famous last words over here.
0.01%:  famous last words. I
0.01%:  that is really good.
0.01%:  my other advice formula turns
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs room
0.01%:  this was free advice
0.01%:  that one was regular
0.01%:  this really IS over
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not more
0.01%:  this wouldn
0.01%:  so my last advice formula rule is
0.01%:  so I guess my formula will cover
0.01%:  my formula is over! I should
0.01%:  it was harder for nurses. My
0.01%:  I got this covered from
0.01%:  slow your
0.04%:  slow your roll there
0.02%:  slow your roll!
0.01%:  slow your roll there!
0.01%:  slow your roll.
0.01%:  this formula is gross and
0.01%:  this last advice I
0.01%:  you win! I must have missed all
0.01%:  I have four
0.01%:  so I threw
0.01%:  my advice is useless.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ruined!
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly uns
0.01%:  I will never forget this classy
0.01%:  so this formula clearly gets worse and
0.01%:  clearly I was serious
0.01%:  so this formula IS really great
0.01%:  I totally would have
0.01%:  my friends. I love
0.01%:  even for me this
0.01%:  my source is
0.01%:  radical nurses
0.01%:  your turns
0.01%:  I never say
0.01%:  I never say this
0.01%:  nurse.
0.01%:  no this is
0.01%:  no this is clearly
0.01%:  granted.
0.01%:  I guess my formula also has
0.01%:  so this is my last advice for now. I
0.01%:  frig I totally should
0.01%:  this formula can last
0.01%:  my formula is written.
0.01%:  my new formula is a little rough
0.01%:  no more calls from the
0.01%:  all credit goes to my formula. I have
0.01%:  that was clearly one
0.01%:  so I started
0.01%:  clearly I have st
0.01%:  clearly this formula goes in
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula has serious
0.01%:  clearly I have a lot more words
0.01%:  my results
0.01%:  you should write some
0.01%:  so my formula is great! I
0.01%:  so my formula is great! I should
0.01%:  clearly I have M
0.01%:  never call me for that
0.01%:  my last one would
0.01%:  clearly I got this formula down!
0.01%:  my secret formula is so
0.01%:  I will never use this forum
0.01%:  now I am fully
0.01%:  I guess my formula can lead
0.01%:  I guess they still
0.01%:  this is really over.
0.01%:  I guess this formula will need a
0.01%:  this game is clearly not over
0.01%:  this game is clearly not over!
0.01%:  my formula is worse and
0.01%:  my final words are these.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now as
0.01%:  now my formula has started
0.01%:  my last 
0.01%:  this formula is only as clever
0.01%:  I have a strong
0.01%:  surgery
0.02%:  surgery nurses
0.01%:  I never said it was great
0.01%:  so the formula is really cr
0.01%:  I am not sure if
0.01%:  so I have clearly failed
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so great we don
0.01%:  my last five dollars are on me
0.01%:  I seem to have run out of silly
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is dev
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly worse
0.01%:  so the formula is slowly
0.01%:  my new goal is to have
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula has serious
0.01%:  my advice formula is now DEST
0.01%:  so my formula is less great than I would
0.01%:  my last advice was not so
0.01%:  I can see this formula slowly
0.01%:  clearly I win forever.
0.01%:  I have to go cry
0.01%:  yes that sounds awful!
0.01%:  whatever! My formula lets
0.01%:  you caught me. I was never
0.01%:  my other formula is less
0.01%:  the formula gets old real
0.01%:  using my formula was harder
0.01%:  so my formula is less a
0.01%:  this formula is all I ever wanted!
0.01%:  my last advice here!
0.01%:  now clearly this formula IS
0.01%:  so I may have run out of ideas
0.01%:  it got really hard for
0.02%:  it got really hard for nurses
0.01%:  well. I guess the
0.10%:  well. I guess the formula
0.03%:  well. I guess the formula is
0.03%:  well. I guess the formula isn
0.02%:  well. I guess the formula can
0.01%:  well. I guess the moral
0.01%:  this formula is still a
0.01%:  from here on out I will
0.01%:  I admit it. My form
0.01%:  my new advice formula is all I
0.01%:  you can have some
0.01%:  it was a long
0.01%:  so clearly I win forever
0.01%:  so most nurses would have
0.01%:  my last word has
0.01%:  this formula is really gross now. I
0.01%:  nurses! My formula is great
0.01%:  so you win this
0.01%:  my voice hurts!
0.01%:  my voice hurts now!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not DE
0.01%:  I guess that one is a
0.01%:  my advice is more than
0.01%:  I guess you won.
0.01%:  nursery schools are out
0.01%:  yes. I could have
0.01%:  this one is clearly worse!
0.01%:  I guess my advice for this
0.01%:  I run with
0.01%:  so this advice formula IS mostly
0.01%:  so my last advice from this
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula is an
0.01%:  I never said my formula was rich
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is P
0.01%:  so my formula is short
0.01%:  my dreams
0.01%:  I can admit this
0.01%:  I can admit this formula
0.01%:  turns out my ver
0.01%:  this is my last idea
0.01%:  clearly this formula is SIMP
0.01%:  my final test
0.03%:  my final test will
0.01%:  forget it! I should really
0.01%:  I got more
0.01%:  this formula really is never
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers a lot.
0.01%:  um. I need
0.01%:  I have to try
0.01%:  it gets more
0.01%:  now that my formula is over
0.01%:  so I admit this formula can
0.01%:  clearly I need to limit
0.01%:  my formula can still do
0.01%:  the formula is clearly good
0.01%:  my formula is weird.
0.01%:  this advice formula really st
0.01%:  that one DES
0.01%:  it seems I
0.01%:  it seems I have
0.02%:  it seems I have finally
0.01%:  it seems I have run
0.01%:  all I have is
0.05%:  all I have is nurses
0.02%:  all I have is nurses left
0.02%:  all I have is nurses.
0.01%:  all I have is nurses left!
0.01%:  not really a great
0.01%:  no fair!
0.01%:  this is my last nurse advice for
0.01%:  whatever! I admit
0.01%:  I still have way
0.01%:  so my advice formula is all the
0.01%:  so clearly it gets less and
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is v
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula D
0.01%:  really the
0.01%:  really the last one is
0.01%:  this is clearly moving towards some
0.01%:  why am I even still
0.01%:  alright. My formula runs
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets ins
0.01%:  so nurses do whatever
0.01%:  clearly I should go write
0.01%:  it was hard for nurses.
0.01%:  I guess my formula holds water!
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is D
0.01%:  so my advice formula is hit
0.01%:  my formula is cr
0.01%:  so this formula really comes
0.01%:  my last advice is for all the nurses I
0.01%:  clearly I have a future in M
0.01%:  you got me. I should
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is DE
0.01%:  so this one was
0.01%:  my formula is do
0.01%:  what else you
0.01%:  my formula is short and
0.01%:  my formula is the worst ever and
0.01%:  so my advice formula is either
0.01%:  that one was less fl
0.01%:  this last one is really good! I
0.01%:  the last one is scary!
0.01%:  this is clearly our worst
0.01%:  it gets really awful around
0.01%:  so I guess my real
0.01%:  so I guess my real advice
0.01%:  so I guess my real advice formula
0.01%:  so I guess my real formula
0.01%:  my last advice is for ME. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for ME. I will
0.01%:  the formula is clearly meant
0.01%:  so my formula has rules.
0.01%:  this is clearly a fruit
0.01%:  this gets less
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses IS a
0.02%:  so my advice for nurses IS a little grim
0.01%:  saving
0.01%:  my last one is for T
0.01%:  my last slogan for this
0.01%:  we can all admit
0.01%:  clearly the formula is word
0.01%:  so nurses are already
0.01%:  the formula can use words
0.01%:  so the formula DE
0.01%:  I lied that
0.01%:  if you ever want
0.01%:  still great advice for nurses who
0.01%:  I still hate
0.03%:  I still hate nurses
0.02%:  I still hate nurses.
0.02%:  I still hate nurses!
0.01%:  now you should give
0.01%:  so the first nurse
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula is no
0.01%:  my secret formula is over. I
0.01%:  so all my formula
0.02%:  so all my formula does is turn
0.02%:  so all my formula does is turn ver
0.01%:  so all my formula does is turn whatever
0.01%:  this formula could easily go
0.01%:  I have some clients
0.01%:  I will never use that for my
0.01%:  not all my advice is useful right
0.01%:  for real that was
0.01%:  I guess you can do
0.01%:  I guess you can do this
0.01%:  I guess you can do whatever
0.01%:  my formula has turned evil.
0.01%:  I guess this was a very
0.01%:  this is now my regular advice formula to
0.01%:  I guess this formula really is cr
0.01%:  this was my last advice forum
0.01%:  I guess that was really mor
0.01%:  my last one is for mothers!
0.01%:  so this formula is great. I
0.01%:  this clearly is a formula
0.01%:  so I really should figure
0.01%:  you scared
0.01%:  this advice is really awful!
0.01%:  I still find
0.01%:  I will freely grant
0.01%:  my last advice is for our mothers
0.01%:  clearly I have talent!
0.01%:  so much for nurses. I totally
0.01%:  words fail me right
0.01%:  my last one is for drug
0.01%:  my last words for nurses
0.01%:  this was really good fun
0.01%:  this is my new life!
0.01%:  my advice formula is not worth
0.01%:  clearly this was some
0.01%:  um I guess this
0.01%:  you lost me.
0.01%:  I would never use
0.01%:  my advice for nurses shows
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice to
0.01%:  so clearly a lot
0.01%:  so clearly a lot of nurses
0.01%:  my advice is still great
0.01%:  so I have lots
0.01%:  so clearly I have some flaws to
0.01%:  my advice formula is IMP
0.01%:  my last advice formula gets serious now!
0.01%:  my last generic form is
0.01%:  get your own form
0.01%:  screw this. I never
0.01%:  my last one is for P
0.01%:  clearly I have found a
0.01%:  clearly this is not for me
0.01%:  enough! My advice formula is almost
0.01%:  clearly this formula is trend
0.01%:  the last ones are
0.01%:  I clearly have got
0.01%:  sh
0.01%:  so this new formula is really great.
0.01%:  nursery schools get
0.01%:  clearly this is now a game.
0.01%:  this is my new advice formula. I guess
0.01%:  this is my last advice formula! T
0.01%:  I still have time for
0.01%:  clearly this gets less fun
0.01%:  enough! My formula still
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a monster. I
0.01%:  I love this formula. My career
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is right out
0.01%:  I was using the
0.05%:  I was using the formula
0.01%:  clearly I have no life
0.01%:  that really made
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have to do
0.01%:  this is my last good one!
0.01%:  not really sure what could
0.01%:  whatever. My formula lets
0.01%:  clearly there is a lot
0.01%:  so my formula is reverse
0.01%:  I forgot what nurses are.
0.01%:  almost all my advice is wrong
0.01%:  as much as I would love for
0.01%:  whatever! My formula sol
0.01%:  sarcasm is hard!
0.01%:  I am clearly a
0.02%:  I am clearly a genius!
0.01%:  I have really run out of words!
0.01%:  my formula is sound!
0.01%:  nurses are a little rough
0.01%:  my advice for nurses has mor
0.01%:  my advice formula lasts until
0.01%:  clearly I should move to writing
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are a tough
0.01%:  this last one was really good! I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is art
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives me un
0.01%:  this advice formula is only great
0.01%:  so where do
0.01%:  this formula is still way more vers
0.01%:  well I guess they could
0.01%:  it usually gets worse as
0.01%:  this is all I need
0.01%:  this is all I need for
0.01%:  not every word fits
0.01%:  I must leave now.
0.01%:  I will give you the formula!
0.01%:  well! I guess this advice isn
0.01%:  I guess the formula was only
0.01%:  nurses! My last
0.06%:  nurses! My last advice
0.13%:  nurses! My last advice formula
0.02%:  nurses! My last advice for
0.02%:  nurses! My last advice is for
0.01%:  nurses! My last formula
0.01%:  nurses! My last advice formula.
0.01%:  I will never go
0.01%:  if you want to hear more advice
0.01%:  now this advice formula must
0.01%:  no I really have
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was um
0.01%:  I still have not
0.03%:  I still have not figured
0.01%:  this last one is really weird
0.01%:  this new advice form
0.01%:  so the formula is really strong!
0.01%:  I could listen to myself give
0.01%:  my formula sounds sorta racist
0.01%:  so this formula D
0.01%:  well that sounds a
0.01%:  so I guess the formula can also
0.01%:  so I admit it!
0.01%:  my last word goes out
0.01%:  my last advice is for all the women!
0.01%:  now my advice formula is gross
0.01%:  this formula really is over now
0.01%:  my last formula was ruined
0.01%:  my formula is still not as
0.01%:  so my advice formula was stolen!
0.01%:  my last formula is on
0.01%:  this is clearly unfair!
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs rig
0.01%:  I guess some of them will
0.01%:  my formula gets worse as I
0.01%:  my goal
0.01%:  so clearly I have lots of writing
0.01%:  my mouth is water
0.01%:  I will admit they
0.01%:  clearly I should not mess
0.01%:  I really should go visit
0.01%:  this formula was a lot more
0.01%:  my formula was right!
0.01%:  I learned that from real
0.01%:  this formula is really smart.
0.01%:  my formula also doesn
0.01%:  this formula is over and
0.01%:  nurses are a very
0.01%:  this formula is a really
0.01%:  so my advice formula is general
0.01%:  so this formula will run dry
0.01%:  listen. I may have screw
0.01%:  I have to go for
0.01%:  well I guess this version
0.01%:  this one is clearly from
0.01%:  I am clearly losing the
0.01%:  clearly the formula is out
0.01%:  forget nurses! My advice is still
0.01%:  this formula really is strong
0.01%:  I really do want
0.01%:  the formula is now over
0.01%:  I really have run out of ideas.
0.01%:  clearly I should go on
0.01%:  clearly nurses have to do
0.01%:  I guess that covers all our
0.02%:  I guess that covers all our friends
0.01%:  so framing
0.01%:  this was so fun!
0.01%:  so this advice will only
0.01%:  so the last one was a
0.01%:  so the formula is largely
0.01%:  it really does
0.01%:  now clearly this formula is at
0.01%:  now I am tired.
0.01%:  so not all my advice forms
0.01%:  this formula is great! I call
0.01%:  this last one is really sad
0.01%:  much later
0.01%:  you win. I must have missed all
0.01%:  DE
0.01%:  that one was more silly
0.01%:  and their
0.01%:  this formula is really worse
0.01%:  this is my last favor.
0.01%:  this formula is truly magic
0.01%:  this last one is full
0.01%:  my new formula is harder
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is greater
0.01%:  so my advice was still
0.01%:  this formula is now clearly over!
0.01%:  this is awesome! I could
0.01%:  my last advice formula sure is
0.01%:  the formula is over. My
0.01%:  my mouth is tired.
0.01%:  forget this I
0.01%:  almost all nurses do their
0.01%:  ready for more
0.01%:  clearly I have lots of nurses
0.01%:  so clearly this formula grew out
0.01%:  sorry for the random
0.01%:  I can tell my
0.04%:  I can tell my formula
0.02%:  I can tell my formula has
0.01%:  not every formula is great. I
0.01%:  not every formula is great. I should
0.01%:  my last line might
0.01%:  so I wrote
0.01%:  my advice formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  so this advice is awful
0.01%:  so clearly this was more of
0.01%:  I still love my first
0.01%:  my last great advice will
0.01%:  sorry that one is awful
0.01%:  you got me there. I
0.01%:  so my advice is a little mor
0.01%:  one last shot
0.01%:  clearly this formula was un
0.01%:  mothers
0.01%:  I must have missed an
0.01%:  I have many more!
0.01%:  so my advice formula throws
0.01%:  all the cool
0.01%:  all the cool nurses
0.01%:  not all my advice is for the
0.01%:  clearly I love it
0.01%:  the formula is very narrow
0.01%:  lots of nurses should
0.01%:  this one was really gross!
0.01%:  so I guess my advice runs
0.01%:  so I could use this
0.01%:  so my formula is not great.
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who T
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wasted
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wasted on me
0.01%:  this new advice formula is P
0.01%:  I was losing myself there!
0.01%:  I admit there was
0.01%:  now call
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula is sort
0.01%:  my last advice is for the long
0.01%:  clearly nurses should fire ME
0.01%:  now this is all I ever
0.01%:  I guess this formula clos
0.01%:  my last dollar goes to nurses!
0.01%:  so a nurse could
0.01%:  that was real
0.01%:  my last advice is for star
0.01%:  guess what my advice formula IS
0.01%:  all I have left is actors
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a new
0.01%:  ignore all
0.01%:  so clearly this formula moves in
0.01%:  so I guess advice for
0.01%:  well I guess this is a
0.01%:  well I guess that covers a
0.01%:  now this is clearly over
0.01%:  I guess that was more for
0.01%:  whatever. I forgot nurses could
0.01%:  your turn for a
0.01%:  really that one is
0.01%:  this is clearly a gold mine for
0.01%:  my last advice is for hair
0.01%:  I give myself a million stars.
0.01%:  that was really gross I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is great now
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is too literal!
0.01%:  when do
0.01%:  when do I start
0.01%:  I never said it was gram
0.01%:  my advice to nurses is D
0.01%:  this formula needs more v
0.01%:  my formula has so
0.01%:  I was never sure
0.01%:  tough crowd. I
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is not vers
0.01%:  this new formula could very
0.01%:  my last one was for
0.01%:  my new formula covers all sorts
0.01%:  so real nurses should
0.01%:  this last one is from my regular
0.01%:  the formula is cr
0.01%:  the formula is clearly so
0.01%:  turns out all of
0.07%:  turns out all of my advice
0.01%:  my formula has serious down
0.01%:  am I wrong
0.01%:  I guess my sl
0.01%:  this formula needs twe
0.01%:  last line
0.01%:  so this new formula covers all
0.01%:  my friends. I guess that
0.01%:  well I have a
0.01%:  so close your
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a ver
0.01%:  I would say nurses
0.01%:  I would say nurses have
0.01%:  that one ver
0.01%:  new record
0.01%:  so my advice formula has still
0.01%:  so my advice formula results in tr
0.01%:  clearly this formula is no more
0.01%:  I still have loads more!
0.01%:  my secret is out! I have
0.01%:  I must have some
0.01%:  not all my advice forms are this
0.01%:  call me when you figure
0.01%:  clearly I should get some
0.01%:  so you tell
0.01%:  it can get really
0.01%:  this formula is less valid
0.01%:  I hate myself now!
0.01%:  I never said my formula was g
0.01%:  my final word is this!
0.01%:  that one is clearly sad
0.01%:  I guess we all learn from this!
0.01%:  all this advice is wrong
0.01%:  my last advice is for the man
0.01%:  it loses its charm around 
0.01%:  this formula is way too clever!
0.01%:  sorry it
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is genius!
0.01%:  so my advice formula is null
0.01%:  my last nurse advice formula
0.01%:  so my formula is great! I should write
0.01%:  this advice formula is M
0.01%:  this was mostly for me. I
0.01%:  harder
0.01%:  this calling
0.01%:  this game is now
0.02%:  this game is now over
0.02%:  this game is now over!
0.01%:  this game is now clearly
0.03%:  this game is now clearly over
0.03%:  this game is now clearly over!
0.01%:  this is my closing
0.01%:  that was all for
0.01%:  so my formula is invalid!
0.01%:  well I have to run!
0.01%:  so sorry
0.01%:  so clearly this formula saves TIME
0.01%:  forget nurses! My advice is worth
0.01%:  well! My formula covers nurses
0.01%:  the formula really is over
0.01%:  those last four all
0.01%:  those last four all sound
0.01%:  if you could have
0.01%:  nurses! My advice has limits.
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is still S
0.01%:  clearly this formula is smart!
0.01%:  I have a small
0.01%:  my last formula was lous
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets over
0.01%:  so not all of my advice is as
0.01%:  nurses. I clearly
0.01%:  this game is clearly won
0.01%:  clearly this is losing steam
0.01%:  you can tell from
0.01%:  clearly I am hitting
0.01%:  I will use this formula in moder
0.01%:  so clearly I have M
0.01%:  my last advice I guess
0.01%:  my last advice I guess is for
0.01%:  my formula is still great. I have
0.01%:  clearly I am over this formula now!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is doing E
0.01%:  this is all we
0.01%:  not all of my advice is gr
0.01%:  my voice is tired now!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula mess
0.01%:  who all
0.01%:  I said this formula was clever
0.01%:  yes. I still have some
0.01%:  we should start calling my form
0.01%:  there is still
0.01%:  there is still room
0.01%:  I can do this forever really
0.01%:  so my advice is great!
0.01%:  so this formula could always
0.01%:  while it sounds
0.01%:  now my advice formula IS
0.01%:  clearly this formula is now S
0.01%:  this was a real
0.01%:  I guess this is really over
0.01%:  no I made
0.01%:  so my formula does have certain
0.01%:  forget this! I never
0.01%:  no more silly advice formula
0.01%:  we really should get to
0.01%:  all valid
0.01%:  so this advice formula was not
0.01%:  I figure this will
0.01%:  I really have to win
0.01%:  nurses! I already have
0.01%:  so this formula is T
0.01%:  so nurses are all evil
0.01%:  well I have lots
0.01%:  clearly this formula is DET
0.01%:  I will never use this formula as a doctor
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is less
0.01%:  this formula is really doing most
0.01%:  using my formula this last
0.01%:  I guess the animals will
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is P
0.01%:  this counts as my
0.01%:  um that was
0.01%:  so it usually gets worse.
0.01%:  I feel weird having
0.01%:  I would imagine
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula is so great
0.01%:  this formula is over. I need
0.01%:  that was very gross!
0.01%:  I guess my formula is not so clever
0.01%:  this is really fun. I could go
0.01%:  now my formula gets
0.01%:  I will also
0.01%:  so this formula ends
0.01%:  so this formula is clever
0.01%:  it does
0.01%:  my clever
0.01%:  I got this under
0.01%:  this formula is very strong!
0.01%:  I guess the formula is very
0.01%:  you said
0.04%:  you said nurses
0.02%:  you said nurses.
0.02%:  you said nurses!
0.01%:  so I admit this formula runs
0.01%:  so clearly this would not
0.01%:  my last round is over
0.01%:  this formula does seem
0.01%:  the last one was over
0.01%:  this formula was a lot less
0.01%:  I lost the formula
0.01%:  so we really
0.02%:  so we really should
0.01%:  so this advice formula is almost
0.01%:  now I get your
0.01%:  this formula will save my career! I
0.01%:  the last one is worse
0.01%:  time for my reward
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses that
0.01%:  so my formula IS useless
0.01%:  I will give credit
0.01%:  that was less moving
0.01%:  so clearly this formula needs IMP
0.01%:  listen! I may
0.01%:  clearly I win at this!
0.01%:  so I guess we solved
0.02%:  so I guess we solved all
0.01%:  so I guess we solved all our
0.01%:  I guess my advice is awful
0.01%:  so they can still
0.01%:  I gave myself car
0.01%:  I may have lost all
0.01%:  so this formula will never go
0.01%:  I gave myself a stomach
0.01%:  so I clearly have limits!
0.01%:  clearly now I should start
0.01%:  all this advice for
0.02%:  all this advice for nurses was
0.01%:  my formula has grown stale. I
0.01%:  for the record I usually
0.01%:  now this formula clearly is
0.01%:  are we still on
0.01%:  so clearly the formula grows tired.
0.01%:  so nurses should totally fire me!
0.01%:  my advice is awful.
0.01%:  so much for last year
0.01%:  I guess this is my new full
0.01%:  my last advice is for am
0.01%:  my formula is such
0.01%:  I never claimed this to
0.01%:  clearly I win at life!
0.01%:  see you
0.01%:  I will not argue
0.01%:  sarcasm mode is
0.01%:  clearly I have tons more!
0.01%:  that sounds way less favour
0.01%:  my last nurse was
0.01%:  clearly the nurses of
0.01%:  so my formula is racist.
0.01%:  it got really awful
0.01%:  sorry if it
0.03%:  sorry if it sounds
0.01%:  I never claimed that my
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice form
0.01%:  you can go first this
0.01%:  so I screwed that
0.01%:  this formula is really great so
0.01%:  screw you and all
0.01%:  I never said this was moral!
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs at
0.01%:  I give myself a solid D
0.01%:  that one T
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula T
0.01%:  I guess this formula l
0.01%:  my formula is great. I should never
0.01%:  this is clearly time
0.01%:  my last advice rules for
0.02%:  my last advice rules for nurses
0.01%:  whatever man. My formula is solid
0.01%:  almost certain
0.01%:  my last class runs
0.01%:  so mostly this formula leads
0.01%:  clearly nurses are sm
0.01%:  I can tell this is your
0.01%:  I will say it!
0.01%:  this formula is way cool
0.01%:  I am really loving
0.01%:  I am really loving this.
0.01%:  I am really loving this!
0.01%:  I guess the formula is overly
0.01%:  well I guess my formula is over!
0.01%:  um. I guess that was my
0.01%:  listen. My advice has
0.01%:  so it sounds really cr
0.01%:  so I won
0.01%:  this is really great for
0.01%:  this is really great for nurses
0.01%:  listen guys. I have
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula has some
0.01%:  this got less clever
0.01%:  my last advice is for mail
0.01%:  well after
0.01%:  well! My formula has covered
0.01%:  this formula gets really weird!
0.01%:  it sounds really awful there.
0.01%:  this is clearly for adults
0.01%:  so clearly this is a gold mine!
0.01%:  this is coming really
0.01%:  the formula runs low
0.01%:  so! My advice formula still has
0.01%:  so my new formula covers all the
0.01%:  so it clearly gets
0.01%:  so it clearly gets worse
0.01%:  so clearly I have a future!
0.01%:  now those
0.01%:  now those last
0.01%:  now those are all
0.01%:  clearly I have limits on
0.01%:  I never said this formula was legit.
0.01%:  this formula really is screw
0.01%:  so my advice is wrong all the time!
0.01%:  the formula is already
0.01%:  clearly.
0.01%:  this is my last advice for all
0.01%:  my friends! I have a lot more
0.01%:  well I guess that clos
0.01%:  whoever said nurses t
0.01%:  that was less nice
0.01%:  so my formula is less novel
0.01%:  I have to write all my
0.01%:  this is a good formula.
0.01%:  alright! I will admit
0.01%:  my focus is narrow
0.01%:  clearly the formula is missing a word.
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are total
0.01%:  I guess my answer
0.01%:  well I got
0.01%:  well. I guess this formula is over
0.01%:  so is
0.01%:  these will
0.01%:  all this advice is from
0.01%:  so I guess this finally
0.01%:  this formula needs way less
0.01%:  my formula has real world
0.01%:  frig yeah!
0.01%:  I really should save some
0.01%:  my formula still has draw
0.01%:  this is last call.
0.01%:  I seem to have lost my focus!
0.01%:  that was really evil
0.01%:  that one was cruel
0.01%:  so clearly this needs to
0.01%:  you got me. I don
0.01%:  this is really mess
0.01%:  this is really messing
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not SE
0.01%:  that one was fully made
0.01%:  I have made myself
0.01%:  I guess my last formula is over
0.01%:  forget nurses! I still love
0.01%:  my formula can T
0.01%:  sorry for all those nurses
0.01%:  I may have to re
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a modern
0.01%:  ignore my last advice for
0.01%:  this is great. I am
0.01%:  so my formula has down
0.01%:  I have to rest now!
0.01%:  this new formula still seems
0.01%:  this last one was closer
0.01%:  round
0.01%:  I forgot nurses should always
0.01%:  listen. My formula writes
0.01%:  I never said my formula was chill
0.01%:  no!
0.01%:  I deserve all my
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is illegal
0.01%:  so my advice formula still has strong
0.01%:  my last word goes to nurses.
0.01%:  this advice was not
0.01%:  my last formula is even worse!
0.01%:  my last one covers
0.01%:  my last one covers all
0.01%:  the last one is gross.
0.01%:  not really! I was
0.01%:  I guess after
0.01%:  I guess after all
0.02%:  I guess after all this
0.01%:  divorce
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is an
0.01%:  clearly I have talent.
0.01%:  so I totally have
0.01%:  so writing
0.01%:  my advice formula in
0.01%:  so my secret
0.12%:  so my secret formula
0.08%:  so my secret formula isn
0.02%:  so my secret formula was
0.02%:  so my secret formula wasn
0.02%:  so my secret formula has
0.01%:  so my secret formula is still
0.01%:  so my secret formula still
0.01%:  so my secret formula doesn
0.01%:  so my advice formula results in lots
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula is my
0.01%:  it was really more
0.01%:  it was really more fun
0.01%:  so it follows the
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is im
0.01%:  this advice formula is now less
0.01%:  all the nurses left!
0.01%:  that one is clearly words
0.01%:  all my friends are right over
0.01%:  that one is clearly a murder
0.01%:  clearly I have it down!
0.01%:  I can really do
1.18%:  I can really do this forever
0.70%:  I can really do this forever!
0.05%:  I can really do this!
0.04%:  I can really do this.
0.03%:  I can really do this for
0.01%:  my last good answer
0.01%:  dis
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula M
0.01%:  I will never say this formula E
0.01%:  I must have some friends
0.01%:  I have some ideas
0.01%:  I have some ideas for
0.01%:  I never said my formula will get
0.01%:  finally! I am
0.01%:  my last word here.
0.01%:  this last one is called
0.01%:  this formula clearly needs to go vir
0.01%:  calm down! I have
0.01%:  no more! My advice formula is still great
0.01%:  that one is clearly weird
0.01%:  the formula got really
0.02%:  the formula got really weird
0.01%:  so my advice won
0.01%:  all I want is for my
0.01%:  all I want is for my advice
0.01%:  so I guess that doesn
0.01%:  my last advice for us is this
0.01%:  so this advice formula is not all
0.01%:  I guess my formula is D
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving to
0.01%:  this is cool.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is sorta
0.01%:  clearly this is DE
0.01%:  my hat
0.01%:  this is clearly flawed.
0.01%:  who cares if my last
0.01%:  my new advice formula is to tell
0.01%:  that one was very sad
0.01%:  fine. I guess it
0.01%:  see how
0.01%:  I can still hear myself!
0.01%:  my new formula lets
0.01%:  that advice formula seems
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is done.
0.01%:  nurse self
0.01%:  this came out wrong
0.01%:  using this formula I clearly see
0.01%:  so I guess my formula needs a
0.01%:  current
0.01%:  I never said the formula was DE
0.01%:  this went really far
0.01%:  so I guess my formula lets
0.01%:  clearly it was meant
0.01%:  clearly it was meant for lovers
0.01%:  now clearly this formula is D
0.01%:  now I really love
0.01%:  now I really love this
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses was true
0.01%:  so my formula is clear and
0.01%:  uh.
0.01%:  this could get really fun.
0.01%:  this advice formula really is not
0.01%:  I have no words for
0.01%:  so clearly I should form
0.01%:  clearly I should set
0.01%:  I love myself so much!
0.01%:  this advice formula is gross
0.01%:  this last one really came
0.04%:  this last one really came from
0.01%:  my head is still
0.01%:  my last advice was gross
0.01%:  so this is a really
0.01%:  not all my advice is g
0.01%:  this formula really IS good.
0.01%:  frig that sounds scary
0.01%:  so nurses should really give
0.01%:  the formula is very limited!
0.01%:  it was my last good
0.02%:  it was my last good formula
0.01%:  it was my last good formula!
0.01%:  my formula has let
0.01%:  this last one was l
0.01%:  this formula is really weird!
0.01%:  my last night as
0.01%:  this formula IS clearly not
0.01%:  my formula is useless. I give
0.01%:  so the formula IS limited.
0.01%:  so my last formula wouldn
0.01%:  this is truly awful
0.01%:  my advice for nurses sorta
0.01%:  I really want some
0.01%:  so nurses are sad
0.01%:  this is clearly less and
0.01%:  not all of this is very
0.01%:  alright I can
0.01%:  my last advice is for the un
0.01%:  I will give this formula an
0.01%:  I guess in ret
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was almost right
0.01%:  my last advice for all the nurse
0.01%:  so I really screw
0.01%:  I will change my life
0.01%:  tell your friends! I am
0.01%:  I guess you never
0.01%:  I lied. My
0.16%:  I lied. My formula
0.07%:  I lied. My formula is
0.05%:  I lied. My last formula
0.03%:  I lied. My formula was
0.02%:  I lied. My formula isn
0.02%:  I lied. My last formula is
0.02%:  I lied. My formula has
0.01%:  I lied. My formula can
0.01%:  I lied. My last formula wasn
0.01%:  I lied. My formula was never
0.01%:  I lied. My formula is more
0.01%:  so clearly I have no real
0.01%:  my formula got weird at
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is what
0.01%:  I guess it falls down
0.01%:  this formula was clearly not v
0.01%:  so my formula is SE
0.01%:  clearly it gets more
0.01%:  this formula is really causing some
0.01%:  I guess advice is
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is to
0.01%:  so my formula can still have
0.01%:  I admit this formula grows less clever
0.01%:  my last one is for medical
0.01%:  after all those
0.01%:  my friend! I call
0.02%:  my friend! I call this
0.01%:  my formula is great. I love
0.01%:  my last formula is serious.
0.01%:  so clearly I started
0.01%:  this formula is so great I don
0.01%:  so that doesn
0.01%:  I guess this is all my formula can ever
0.01%:  so the formula only results
0.01%:  I never said it all
0.01%:  my new formula has lost
0.01%:  this formula IS very generic
0.01%:  I was using my formula.
0.01%:  so I can really
0.01%:  this formula is way less clever in
0.01%:  this one is mostly awful
0.01%:  friends! I will
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is in
0.01%:  nurses are easy
0.01%:  nurses are easy!
0.01%:  I love this format!
0.01%:  I have some real writing
0.01%:  really whatever
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula is never
0.01%:  so this formula will cover nurses
0.01%:  I love this new formula system!
0.01%:  using my formula I still
0.01%:  using my formula I still have
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is SET
0.01%:  listen. I figured
0.01%:  that one is clearly worse from
0.01%:  so clearly this formula SE
0.01%:  shoot me!
0.01%:  well I guess this formula sort
0.01%:  this advice formula is now really
0.01%:  it got worse!
0.01%:  my last advice is for some
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little sour!
0.01%:  I ran out of steam.
0.01%:  the last one IS
0.01%:  this is my new career. I
0.01%:  I guess my formula ran its
0.01%:  so why are nurses
0.01%:  my last dollar is for the nurses
0.01%:  clearly this formula is some strong
0.01%:  I admit this isn
0.01%:  so really this formula is great
0.01%:  my formula is great! I can
0.01%:  that was me losing focus.
0.01%:  I admit the formula isn
0.01%:  so this formula really needs to
0.01%:  so clearly this formula derives most
0.01%:  this really is great advice for
0.01%:  this one is really good!
0.01%:  I guess this formula covers many
0.01%:  my last advice was to
0.01%:  I love this format.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was some
0.01%:  no more calls for me.
0.01%:  my advice formula will no
0.01%:  what if your advice
0.01%:  this formula really is magic.
0.01%:  I have to rest my
0.01%:  so clearly this was not a
0.01%:  I am clearly having issues
0.01%:  my last advice formula D
0.01%:  good answer.
0.01%:  my advice formula is shit!
0.01%:  I guess you can throw
0.01%:  my new formula gives results
0.01%:  so it sort
0.01%:  I was using my formula as
0.01%:  I should really start over.
0.01%:  cover
0.01%:  my advice formula ran its
0.01%:  right now I really
0.01%:  those were all animals
0.01%:  clearly this is leading
0.01%:  so my last advice formula on
0.01%:  this is a new
0.01%:  this is a new level
0.01%:  my last dollar is for whoever can get
0.01%:  whatever. My formula gets
0.01%:  turns out my advice is also
0.01%:  so give
0.01%:  those were all a
0.01%:  those are all very similar!
0.01%:  they never said I
0.01%:  clearly this was a fun
0.01%:  my formula has issues! I
0.01%:  my last advice is for song writers
0.01%:  I guess this is my c
0.01%:  my final words to the class.
0.01%:  others
0.01%:  I guess this formula really is over!
0.01%:  now the formula gets less
0.01%:  wait hold on.
0.01%:  so my advice formula has un
0.01%:  this was not very useful
0.01%:  I have my formula!
0.01%:  you win! I still have more form
0.01%:  it fails when
0.01%:  my formula is the worst. I
0.01%:  so clearly I must never
0.01%:  this formula is also very
0.01%:  sorry nurses. I was
0.01%:  this formula will give you
0.01%:  I guess that was clever
0.01%:  so the formula rules
0.01%:  so my formula gets weird
0.01%:  clearly I am using this for evil!
0.01%:  my formula is done! I have
0.01%:  I should T
0.01%:  no more advice for me.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was similar
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula gives
0.01%:  I will use this formula once
0.01%:  so this new formula is still
0.01%:  so my last advice formula results in hor
0.01%:  why am I still alive
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a genius move!
0.01%:  my formula is legit.
0.01%:  that one was clearly me
0.01%:  forget this! I am
0.01%:  well I guess my advice formula hits its
0.01%:  my last advice is for the single
0.01%:  my last thing is called
0.01%:  whatever. I guess it only
0.01%:  my formula is worse than it
0.01%:  my advice formula is showing all
0.04%:  my advice formula is showing all sorts
0.01%:  my reward for solving all their
0.01%:  I really went
0.01%:  I really went over
0.01%:  that was rad!
0.01%:  my last few have
0.01%:  my last laugh is on me!
0.01%:  I have to sign
0.01%:  my last advice is this one
0.01%:  I confess it.
0.01%:  clearly the formula is driving us
0.01%:  my advice has run out. I
0.01%:  you can tell me if this
0.01%:  I will agree that nurses
0.01%:  now my advice starts
0.01%:  now this advice formula truly
0.01%:  this last one is way more
0.01%:  those last four aren
0.01%:  well! My advice for
0.07%:  well! My advice for nurses
0.08%:  well! My advice for nurses is that
0.02%:  well! My advice for nurses is to
0.01%:  well! My advice for nurses has
0.01%:  so my advice still has some
0.01%:  forget all my answers!
0.01%:  clearly we have found our limits.
0.01%:  so nurses are always right.
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula los
0.01%:  this is mostly for
0.01%:  using this formula is way more
0.01%:  my formula is rather
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is still rough
0.01%:  you should give me some
0.01%:  whatever! My formula gets
0.01%:  I clearly have not master
0.01%:  the formula is clearly to
0.01%:  silly!
0.01%:  that was my real
0.01%:  I gave myself one
0.01%:  I gave myself one last
0.01%:  I guess this formula is now over.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is moving towards DE
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is more a
0.01%:  this is all I ever wanted!
0.01%:  so nurses have totally
0.01%:  my final advice is more
0.01%:  whatever. I couldn
0.01%:  I really want to go
0.01%:  those are my last good
0.01%:  alright. I don
0.01%:  I really won
0.01%:  so this formula ST
0.01%:  this formula is really coming to
0.01%:  I am all out of ver
0.01%:  no last words for
0.01%:  last one for you.
0.01%:  not all advice is great for
0.01%:  so my formula shows its
0.01%:  rarely do I ever
0.01%:  my advice is now for
0.01%:  so I guess we all learn from
0.01%:  so I guess we all learn from this today
0.01%:  so for nurses I was
0.01%:  those were all gross.
0.01%:  what if I gave
0.01%:  this formula sounds great.
0.01%:  my other advice for nurses is still
0.01%:  I will give myself a 
0.01%:  this is clearly more fun as
0.01%:  clearly this formula is ruined. I
0.01%:  so I guess my friends have
0.01%:  I guess my formula is the worst.
0.01%:  my last advice for normal
0.01%:  now that I said
0.01%:  nurses are a tough crowd. My
0.01%:  nurses are a tough crowd. My last
0.01%:  I will never use your last
0.01%:  clearly this is a losing format
0.01%:  my last word on this. I am
0.01%:  I will give the
0.03%:  I will give the nurses
0.01%:  I will give the last
0.01%:  I will give the formula
0.01%:  I will give the formula credit
0.01%:  so for nurses I would say
0.01%:  this one is for
0.01%:  I love nurses right
0.01%:  this got really weird. I
0.01%:  my advice is still awful
0.01%:  my last anal
0.01%:  so tell
0.01%:  so tell me what
0.01%:  I can feel my soul
0.01%:  my formula gets old when
0.01%:  I guess my advice starts
0.01%:  it gets hard now
0.01%:  my last advance will
0.01%:  my last four were
0.01%:  whoever tells
0.01%:  you caught me on
0.01%:  my level
0.01%:  so I guess my formula covers it
0.04%:  so I guess my formula covers it all.
0.01%:  my last formula ever was
0.01%:  listen. My formula holds
0.01%:  the formula is losing its l
0.01%:  now that all
0.01%:  clearly this is not real
0.01%:  so clearly this formula won me
0.01%:  my advice formula is a little gr
0.01%:  the formula really gets
0.01%:  this formula was my last
0.01%:  this new formula could also
0.01%:  so I guess they don
0.01%:  framing that
0.01%:  framing that advice
0.01%:  this advice formula is nearly
0.01%:  clearly I had some issues
0.01%:  I have more nurses
0.01%:  this is my last good formula! I
0.01%:  so my last word
0.01%:  I can still feel
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives us no
0.01%:  so this really could
0.01%:  I guess not all forms are
0.01%:  well! I guess that could
0.01%:  that was clearly in
0.01%:  my last advice is for all our mothers!
0.01%:  it shows
0.01%:  and it
0.01%:  the rules
0.01%:  now my advice formula is short
0.01%:  I guess this means you
0.01%:  my formula is still generic
0.01%:  seems legit
0.01%:  that one was more for me
0.01%:  I will confess it
0.01%:  that one is grim
0.01%:  still sound
0.01%:  I am clearly the most vers
0.01%:  clearly I am having serious
0.01%:  this list is clearly over
0.01%:  my advice is for all nurses who are
0.01%:  whatever. My formula can do
0.01%:  lots of nurses will have
0.01%:  first I
0.01%:  my last advice goes for all
0.01%:  this last one comes from a
0.02%:  this last one comes from a very
0.01%:  this last one comes from a really
0.01%:  actual nurses will have some
0.01%:  that was gross. I clearly
0.01%:  I clearly have to figure
0.01%:  the formula is clearly over! I
0.01%:  listen. My formula is almost
0.01%:  my advice formula was right.
0.01%:  nurses are really gross!
0.01%:  well at least I have
0.01%:  this is clearly awesome and I must
0.01%:  forget it! I was
0.01%:  forget it! I was clearly
0.01%:  so I never claimed this formula was 
0.01%:  last try for me
0.01%:  I should go.
0.01%:  that one is clear
0.01%:  so clearly this met
0.01%:  this formula only gives me 
0.01%:  either my formula can
0.01%:  my formula is useless and I have
0.01%:  clearly this formula is SP
0.01%:  I have some writers
0.01%:  the formula was a
0.01%:  this formula is really great now.
0.01%:  my lunch is almost over so
0.01%:  my formula is clear!
0.01%:  screw all you nurse
0.01%:  clearly I have ins
0.01%:  I am sorry for was
0.02%:  I am sorry for wasting all
0.02%:  I am sorry for wasting all our
0.02%:  I am sorry for wasting all our time.
0.01%:  I am sorry for wasting our
0.01%:  so really this formula gives
0.01%:  I would never say it
0.01%:  so clearly this new formula is great! I
0.01%:  that one is slowly
0.01%:  this formula is never really
0.01%:  I should write all my
0.01%:  now that is scary!
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurse
0.01%:  there really is a formula!
0.01%:  hear me out! I
0.01%:  so my last advice formula result
0.01%:  yes! I will give
0.01%:  so my last formula would have
0.01%:  my advice formula is DEEP
0.01%:  no last words from me!
0.01%:  those are my last four.
0.01%:  all serious
0.01%:  so clearly this is meant
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is doing
0.02%:  whatever. My formula is doing all
0.01%:  my new advice formula IS sort
0.01%:  now I am very
0.01%:  now I am very tired
0.01%:  so clearly this formula saves time!
0.01%:  you caught me! I wrote
0.01%:  my formula has un
0.01%:  the formula IS very limited.
0.01%:  I am calling myself
0.01%:  our session
0.04%:  our session is over.
0.01%:  our session is over. I
0.01%:  my formula is solved.
0.01%:  my last advice is for sugar
0.01%:  nurses. I clearly have
0.01%:  so I guess my formula has a lot
0.01%:  so my last advice was more fun
0.01%:  my last term of service will
0.01%:  we should all start our
0.01%:  clearly those last four are
0.01%:  my advice formula is stellar!
0.01%:  so those are
0.01%:  guess what my friends
0.01%:  guess what my friends call
0.01%:  this advice formula only lasts 
0.01%:  I guess this was only
0.01%:  might need
0.01%:  those are my last five.
0.01%:  clearly this is S
0.01%:  game over! My formula is still
0.01%:  I have already
0.01%:  settle down.
0.01%:  actual nurses will see
0.02%:  actual nurses will see right
0.01%:  clearly I am the new
0.01%:  almost all of my advice turns
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses. I
0.01%:  my formula is racist now
0.01%:  so not every formula was
0.01%:  I love nurses with
0.01%:  clearly this formula is reward
0.01%:  no more weird
0.01%:  hold my
0.03%:  hold my calls for
0.07%:  hold my calls for a minute
0.03%:  hold my calls for a minute!
0.03%:  hold my calls for a minute.
0.02%:  hold my calls!
0.01%:  hold my calls.
0.01%:  I guess we found all
0.01%:  so this new advice formula rules.
0.01%:  this was really an
0.01%:  it was a small
0.02%:  it was a small victory
0.01%:  so clearly the worst nurses
0.01%:  there was some
0.01%:  so that was really gross!
0.01%:  I never said this formula was my
0.01%:  my last advice is for all three
0.01%:  my new advice formula still st
0.01%:  nurses are hard to figure
0.01%:  I never said my formula was close to gr
0.01%:  my last advice is to go
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is a
0.01%:  I lost my voice!
0.01%:  my last one falls
0.01%:  clearly I have less
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs w
0.01%:  so clearly this is a useful
0.01%:  I lie.
0.01%:  last try. I
0.01%:  my mind is full with
0.01%:  more than
0.01%:  so this new advice formula really IS
0.01%:  well fr
0.01%:  well frig that
0.01%:  so my advice formula still has errors.
0.01%:  I never said my formula was c
0.01%:  so not all my formula
0.01%:  so clearly this formula saves writing
0.01%:  this last one is clearly DE
0.01%:  this is great. I love myself
0.01%:  so clearly I figured out how
0.01%:  my last guess would
0.01%:  I never said my formula was DEP
0.01%:  that was really gross in
0.01%:  I must really love nurses if
0.01%:  listen. My formula has a lot
0.01%:  this formula was E
0.01%:  so all nurses get
0.01%:  so clearly we don
0.01%:  all my friends!
0.01%:  now tell me if
0.01%:  my last advice feels
0.01%:  their lives sound really fr
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is a little gr
0.01%:  so I guess that was all
0.01%:  clearly this formula IS vers
0.01%:  so my advice is great.
0.01%:  so I got carried
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is well
0.01%:  clearly this gets me
0.01%:  not such a great
0.01%:  clearly I went from
0.01%:  I can see this is over.
0.01%:  my grandma was
0.01%:  forget nurses. I was really
0.01%:  that sounds really gross for
0.01%:  now the formula is clear
0.01%:  what if nurses got really
0.01%:  what if nurses got really mad
0.01%:  I gave myself this one!
0.01%:  yes I will grant this
0.02%:  yes I will grant this formula
0.01%:  this advice is mostly wrong
0.01%:  someone should
0.01%:  I could go on with
0.01%:  that sounds way gross!
0.01%:  famous writers
0.01%:  clearly this is not a formula.
0.01%:  can we try
0.01%:  can we try this
0.03%:  can we try this formula
0.01%:  my friends! I guess we
0.01%:  so advice
0.01%:  I have it
0.01%:  I have it from
0.01%:  that one was more self
0.01%:  well! I guess this covers
0.01%:  so I have clearly written
0.01%:  frig it sounds
0.01%:  so my formula got less
0.01%:  my last advice is short
0.01%:  clearly this formula is triv
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was co
0.01%:  start calling
0.01%:  I run out of clever
0.02%:  I run out of clever ways
0.01%:  I run out of clever words
0.01%:  so my last formula covered
0.03%:  so my last formula covered nurses
0.01%:  I never claimed this was E
0.01%:  the last one is clearly from
0.01%:  this is a very strange formula
0.01%:  clearly this is an error
0.01%:  well if this
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is somehow
0.01%:  I guess your advice wasn
0.01%:  well. I guess my advice formula hits
0.01%:  nurses are really cool
0.01%:  this one is scary
0.01%:  some nurses are
0.01%:  I really love this format!
0.01%:  if this advice
0.01%:  my last dollar is right
0.01%:  my advice formula is written.
0.01%:  sarcasm doesn
0.01%:  so I guess all the advice
0.01%:  so I guess it still
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice formula in
0.01%:  I wrote this formula during my
0.01%:  I may have gotten
0.09%:  I may have gotten carried
0.01%:  listen. I still have more
0.01%:  my secret formula is no
0.01%:  never call me!
0.01%:  my advice will not
0.01%:  turn the
0.01%:  um. My advice formula is great
0.01%:  yes! I will admit this formula runs
0.01%:  so my last advice formula uses
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wrong. I
0.01%:  secret
0.01%:  my advice for nurses has lost me
0.01%:  that one IS scary!
0.01%:  using my formula that is
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a genius.
0.01%:  this gets me really
0.01%:  now I love this
0.09%:  now I love this formula!
0.01%:  my last class leaves
0.01%:  my last advice is for mortals who
0.01%:  last night I was
0.01%:  all credit for those
0.01%:  clearly this formula is res
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not over!
0.01%:  shall
0.01%:  clearly this formula goes to
0.01%:  I love myself again
0.01%:  that one was me.
0.01%:  so using
0.03%:  so using my formula I
0.03%:  so using my formula is
0.02%:  so using my formula I have
0.01%:  so using my formula is hard
0.01%:  so using my formula has
0.01%:  so using my advice
0.20%:  so using my advice formula
0.03%:  so using my advice formula will
0.03%:  so using my advice formula I
0.03%:  so using my advice formula is
0.01%:  so using my advice formula has
0.01%:  so using my advice formula I will
0.01%:  clearly I am right
0.01%:  yeah no
0.01%:  the formula IS limited.
0.01%:  so I can still use my
0.07%:  so I can still use my formula
0.01%:  grocery
0.04%:  grocery stores
0.01%:  um never
0.01%:  fair. I
0.01%:  fair. I guess
0.01%:  fair. I guess nurses
0.01%:  now cut
0.01%:  this may not all
0.01%:  my other advice formula is a
0.01%:  the formula is really good.
0.01%:  the formula is clearly sort
0.01%:  clearly this formula is tired! I
0.01%:  you got me! I ran
0.01%:  well I guess that sum
0.01%:  general
0.01%:  general advice
0.01%:  I will come
0.01%:  so I used
0.01%:  so my new formula is still a
0.01%:  I will only ever use this for
0.01%:  my last advice is for MET
0.01%:  my final advice is I
0.01%:  so this formula is only as
0.01%:  I could see myself
0.01%:  I could see myself using
0.02%:  I could see myself using this
0.01%:  I could see myself having
0.01%:  my formula is not as great
0.01%:  this was really fun. I could go
0.01%:  so clearly nurses love that
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more vague
0.01%:  clearly this is over. I guess
0.01%:  my last event
0.01%:  listen. I may have missed
0.01%:  nurses! I would have
0.01%:  so I guess my advice is D
0.01%:  this formula is great. My
0.01%:  this was fun! I really
0.01%:  yeah so I
0.01%:  last time I
0.01%:  last time I swear
0.01%:  my real formula is less
0.01%:  I never said this was formula
0.01%:  this advice formula really is strong
0.01%:  for this last round
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is wonder
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is a little n
0.01%:  my advice formula has got its
0.01%:  my last rule for this is
0.01%:  I never claimed this formula was EMP
0.01%:  my advice formula is general
0.01%:  I guess nurses are do
0.01%:  this class is over for
0.01%:  this class is over for now
0.01%:  I was totally using
0.01%:  new form
0.01%:  I guess this formula tells
0.01%:  my last real answer
0.01%:  that one is really for
0.01%:  I clearly ran out of words!
0.01%:  now you have to tell
0.01%:  my last advice formula is serious now
0.01%:  so my formula reveals that
0.01%:  the last one was really good. I
0.01%:  so nurses have it worse
0.01%:  the formula is less magical now
0.01%:  whose fault
0.01%:  time for lunch. I
0.01%:  clearly this formula is time
0.01%:  that one is v
0.01%:  that one is vaguely awful
0.01%:  my sister is a nurse!
0.01%:  so my formula has real
0.01%:  that was really forced!
0.01%:  so this really is
0.01%:  my formula is wrong!
0.01%:  my fingers are sore
0.01%:  clearly this was an over
0.01%:  my secret formula is over! I
0.01%:  so this new formula is really great!
0.01%:  so clearly this rule doesn
0.01%:  I guess my formula is a lot
0.01%:  this may sound great
0.01%:  my last advice answer for
0.01%:  I guess not all of my advice has
0.01%:  forget nurses. My advice is all
0.01%:  so my formula still gives
0.01%:  I had fun
0.01%:  I guess that one would
0.01%:  clearly this idea was
0.01%:  yeah man
0.01%:  I can see myself right
0.01%:  this is all coming very
0.01%:  I said nurses!
0.01%:  you were right all
0.01%:  screw this. My formula isn
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is more vague
0.01%:  this is really strange
0.01%:  so I must admit
0.01%:  my last advice rules are
0.02%:  my last advice rules are for
0.01%:  my new formula does have
0.01%:  there I lost myself in
0.01%:  this formula will not serve
0.01%:  I totally love
0.02%:  I totally love nurses
0.01%:  I admit this formula only covers a
0.01%:  so the formula is way
0.02%:  so the formula is way less
0.01%:  so the advice turns
0.01%:  the formula is trying
0.01%:  that was on
0.01%:  well for
0.01%:  sorry nurses. I should
0.01%:  so nurses have lots
0.01%:  no more advice! My
0.01%:  no more advice! My formula
0.01%:  coming full
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good. I am
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is done
0.01%:  firstly
0.01%:  this is clearly ver
0.01%:  my last advice formula result
0.01%:  your advice
0.01%:  those are all very similar.
0.01%:  wish
0.03%:  wish granted
0.02%:  wish I could
0.01%:  wish I could say
0.01%:  that was a cl
0.01%:  so with my formula I could give
0.01%:  you were right. I ran
0.02%:  you were right. I ran out of ver
0.01%:  that one is clearly words from
0.01%:  it was really hard to form
0.01%:  forget my last advice. I
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is dr
0.01%:  my mouth is closed forever!
0.01%:  hat
0.01%:  I guess those are
0.04%:  I guess those are all
0.01%:  so whatever! I still
0.01%:  that one would really
0.01%:  my last formula ever.
0.01%:  this game is clearly over. I don
0.01%:  my alarm
0.01%:  my last lesson for the
0.01%:  so I guess my formula does well
0.01%:  no more for us
0.01%:  clearly this formula is nut
0.01%:  not all my advice is so awful.
0.01%:  clearly I love using the
0.01%:  those are all great
0.01%:  so clearly this is moving
0.01%:  so clearly this is moving towards
0.01%:  I should really go visit
0.01%:  so sure
0.01%:  so my advice rules might
0.01%:  I ran out of advice.
0.01%:  I guess the results vary from
0.01%:  sarcasm is really
0.01%:  I should give myself a rest
0.01%:  so my advice formula is TE
0.01%:  I am sorry that
0.01%:  I will use this formula to advise my
0.01%:  I lost my voice during
0.01%:  this was really fun to do! I
0.01%:  listen! I have to
0.01%:  that one I really screw
0.01%:  so nurses are clearly a
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs TIME
0.01%:  not all of them were classy.
0.01%:  my last advice is for or
0.01%:  clearly I should start a series
0.01%:  it is clearly
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is a
0.01%:  there I crossed a
0.01%:  now doctors
0.01%:  so I have clearly missed
0.01%:  I guess my friend
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is that um
0.01%:  my advice formula is a thing
0.01%:  I really wish someone
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives out
0.01%:  final class
0.01%:  clearly this formula is some version
0.01%:  I have to call my friends
0.01%:  that advice was more
0.01%:  my advice formula was useless.
0.01%:  ignore my last advice. I
0.01%:  I guess this last advice formula only
0.01%:  this advice formula seems to run
0.01%:  this formula is very strange
0.01%:  my last five dollars is
0.01%:  I guess it sounds more
0.01%:  my formula is over. I can
0.01%:  this formula was not as
0.01%:  this formula was not as clever
0.01%:  we should really move on!
0.01%:  clearly we should run
0.01%:  frig my last
0.01%:  frig my last advice
0.01%:  even if this
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a string
0.01%:  for real that sounds
0.01%:  screw all you nurse hat
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is a little r
0.01%:  now the formula clearly is
0.01%:  now I really am tired.
0.01%:  now I am really scared for
0.01%:  time for another
0.01%:  how many more ver
0.01%:  so nurses have it really good
0.01%:  clearly I should start fr
0.01%:  so I guess the formula is limited.
0.01%:  my last formula gets
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are mart
0.01%:  I guess my advice is almost
0.01%:  so it turned
0.01%:  so my future
0.01%:  theirs
0.01%:  so the formula is valid.
0.01%:  this got serious
0.01%:  further
0.01%:  that was a gross one. I
0.01%:  well! My advice for nurses might
0.01%:  I guess this formula S
0.01%:  this formula is not always clever
0.01%:  so my new advice has
0.01%:  my heart is racing a
0.01%:  for reals I should
0.01%:  so my advice formula is a little gross.
0.01%:  why does
0.01%:  this was clearly one
0.01%:  my last dime is calling
0.01%:  this new advice formula got
0.01%:  this new advice formula got really
0.01%:  so when I said
0.01%:  last one for today
0.01%:  turns out all my advice forms
0.01%:  my real advice to nurses is D
0.01%:  my advice for nurse
0.01%:  my last advice string was
0.01%:  it got really hard for nurses.
0.01%:  only five
0.01%:  this formula is way strong
0.01%:  this M
0.01%:  this formula gets we
0.01%:  now my advice formula is shot!
0.01%:  tell your friends I have
0.01%:  that one was grim!
0.01%:  I lost myself a
0.01%:  so clearly the formula miss
0.01%:  I never said this formula was ter
0.01%:  that was gross. I never said my form
0.01%:  that one is way scar
0.01%:  it was really hard.
0.01%:  so for nurses it was
0.01%:  well I guess my formula is over.
0.01%:  I really should give it a rest for now
0.01%:  the formula is over. I will
0.01%:  that was more of a r
0.01%:  I declare myself a
0.01%:  so my formula is a little harder
0.01%:  the formula is really great.
0.01%:  this last one was ugly
0.01%:  now I have figured
0.01%:  this last advice rule
0.01%:  I swear it
0.01%:  my last one is for S
0.01%:  clearly I was having issues
0.01%:  this new formula IS clearly
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets M
0.01%:  so my advice formula is gr
0.01%:  I clearly got this
0.01%:  this made me cry
0.01%:  so this is clearly not for
0.01%:  my formula is a little gross!
0.01%:  clearly this is over! I must
0.01%:  I am willing to share
0.01%:  my last formula is not as
0.01%:  my final advice to writers
0.01%:  now!
0.01%:  not sure how I arrived
0.01%:  I guess this was really a
0.01%:  no more advice! My formula has
0.01%:  I love my formula and this
0.01%:  clearly this formula is go
0.01%:  well! I guess this means my
0.01%:  this is my last advice form
0.01%:  now I really must have
0.01%:  so my advice formula is not stellar
0.01%:  this is my new focus
0.01%:  my last advice is for sh
0.01%:  I really could use a
0.01%:  so clearly I have great
0.01%:  this new formula is clearly DE
0.01%:  well my advice formula is not
0.01%:  I got really
0.02%:  I got really carried
0.01%:  guess how
0.01%:  my advice is strong
0.01%:  clearly this formula is serving our
0.01%:  I give myself two stars!
0.01%:  now this is all very
0.01%:  all this time
0.01%:  my friends! IT
0.01%:  I really should run
0.01%:  this last one is over
0.01%:  my formula is clear now
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs to grow.
0.01%:  that one is rad!
0.01%:  are we all clear on this
0.01%:  it gets old.
0.01%:  so it always
0.03%:  so it always sounds
0.01%:  so it always turns
0.01%:  so it always falls
0.01%:  so it always ends
0.01%:  this formula is DIS
0.01%:  no more of
0.02%:  no more of this!
0.01%:  no more of this. I
0.01%:  I guess my formula has never
0.01%:  that one may or
0.01%:  frig. My advice
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses who
0.01%:  that answer
0.01%:  clearly this formula is done over
0.01%:  I may have ruined all
0.01%:  I may have ruined all forms
0.01%:  I freely admit this was
0.01%:  that one is clearly M
0.01%:  that one is clearly MED
0.01%:  you laugh
0.01%:  so my advice starts
0.01%:  my last advice for our session
0.01%:  whatever friends
0.01%:  your turn! S
0.01%:  I guess this formula is all done
0.01%:  my formula is sorta racist
0.01%:  almost sure
0.01%:  well! I guess that ends
0.01%:  well! I guess that ends our
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ro
0.01%:  so I can still use my regular
0.01%:  so the nurse
0.01%:  well I guess that isn
0.01%:  this last one was clearly over
0.01%:  this formula is very good. I will
0.01%:  my last formula is less good than
0.01%:  I really have to go to
0.01%:  this is mostly awful advice
0.01%:  nervous
0.01%:  nervous system
0.01%:  nervous systems
0.01%:  so that advice wasn
0.01%:  I really should invest some
0.01%:  um listen
0.01%:  so some of my
0.02%:  so some of my advice isn
0.01%:  so some of my advice still
0.01%:  so some of my advice turns
0.01%:  nurses get out
0.01%:  my last lesson here
0.01%:  that sounds way scarier if
0.01%:  that I
0.01%:  my last advice is for utah
0.01%:  I may have written all
0.01%:  the list is over
0.01%:  the list is over!
0.01%:  my source for this was a
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula gets
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are frag
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is genius! I
0.01%:  I really should revisit
0.01%:  my last advice for when
0.01%:  my formula was right on
0.01%:  I will use this formula no
0.01%:  I will use this formula no more!
0.01%:  fine! I should
0.01%:  for the record!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives us an
0.01%:  so that was really more
0.01%:  so. I guess this formula can
0.01%:  for reals this is my last advice. I
0.01%:  the formula is less cool
0.01%:  clearly this formula is so ins
0.01%:  my last advice is this formula
0.01%:  my last free advice!
0.01%:  you win. I guess that covers
0.02%:  you win. I guess that covers all
0.01%:  so my advice formula stress
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over now. I guess
0.01%:  it gets weird!
0.01%:  I love how my
0.05%:  I love how my formula
0.03%:  I love how my formula is
0.02%:  I love how my formula turns
0.01%:  I love how my formula can
0.01%:  we should really start using some
0.01%:  so my formula gets cor
0.01%:  clearly that one is gross
0.01%:  whatever. My formula sol
0.01%:  my last clue for
0.01%:  now clearly this is over
0.01%:  so I guess that advice was
0.01%:  clearly the nurses formula is worst
0.01%:  my last advice is to run from
0.01%:  that advice was less useful!
0.01%:  I love my life.
0.01%:  we still have a
0.01%:  I will never say such
0.01%:  my last advice is there
0.01%:  this is my last clever formula
0.01%:  this is clearly genius
0.01%:  my friends are great
0.01%:  well! I guess that means
0.01%:  my head is full now. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for salt.
0.01%:  nurses go
0.01%:  I guess you still haven
0.01%:  what if I told you nurses D
0.01%:  whatever! My formula can do
0.01%:  a lot of nurses should
0.01%:  well in
0.01%:  my whole
0.01%:  clearly I was having some sort
0.01%:  so the formula really was
0.01%:  I have really lost it
0.01%:  so they all sound similar
0.01%:  that was only a
0.01%:  you all have
0.01%:  I am sorry for using
0.01%:  I never said this formula was mer
0.01%:  I only wrote
0.01%:  fine! I really
0.01%:  they mess
0.01%:  I ran out of silly words!
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have awful
0.01%:  my formula has covered all sorts
0.01%:  I will admit to myself
0.01%:  not all these
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is still sound.
0.01%:  my advice for nurses still has
0.01%:  close your mouths.
0.01%:  I see this
0.01%:  I see this formula
0.01%:  I see this formula could
0.01%:  so my new advice formula rel
0.01%:  enough! My formula writes
0.01%:  using my formula there was
0.01%:  my last advice is for I
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula grows
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula grows less
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula grows less clever
0.01%:  my advice is real
0.01%:  no more for me. I
0.01%:  I am clearly having some sort
0.01%:  clearly I would not
0.02%:  clearly I would not have
0.01%:  my formula has errors.
0.01%:  my formula is acting
0.01%:  this formula is clearly not over
0.01%:  not really! I have
0.01%:  this is really screw
0.01%:  this advice is not always useful
0.01%:  DI
0.01%:  I never said this formula was cool
0.01%:  the last one is way
0.01%:  the last one is way less
0.01%:  this last one is from my regular advice.
0.01%:  short form
0.01%:  tell your friends how
0.03%:  tell your friends how great
0.03%:  tell your friends how great I am.
0.01%:  my last good formula
0.01%:  I guess some of my
0.04%:  I guess some of my advice isn
0.03%:  I guess some of my advice still
0.02%:  I guess some of my advice turns
0.02%:  I guess some of my advice will
0.01%:  those were mostly all
0.01%:  fine! My last advice will
0.01%:  so this is all very clear
0.01%:  so I never said my formula was short.
0.01%:  the last one is really sad.
0.01%:  so yours
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is no
0.01%:  that one was really for me
0.01%:  clearly this formula was ST
0.01%:  listen. I admit
0.01%:  so those last four
0.01%:  yes! I guess that
0.01%:  this is very fun
0.01%:  this formula only gets we
0.01%:  I can tell we
0.01%:  this formula is truly magical. I
0.01%:  that was clearly some
0.01%:  so that sounds awful!
0.01%:  that one could also
0.01%:  you win! I had
0.01%:  clearly what I need is to
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives out some
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not SPE
0.01%:  my last advice formula is honest.
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula has its
0.01%:  I guess this really is an
0.01%:  I guess this really is an awful
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is worst under
0.01%:  yours sounds
0.01%:  so the formula sounds very
0.02%:  so the formula sounds very similar.
0.01%:  totally valid
0.01%:  clearly I love this format and
0.01%:  so my formula does well
0.01%:  my formula will get
0.01%:  this formula is now all
0.01%:  this formula is now all used
0.01%:  the formula is valid!
0.01%:  clearly showing
0.01%:  my last class is free and
0.01%:  so I guess this formula DE
0.01%:  for a nurse who
0.01%:  so clearly I missed the
0.01%:  you can figure
0.01%:  you can tell them
0.01%:  clearly I would have to
0.01%:  so this is clearly over.
0.01%:  it gets hard!
0.01%:  my last advice is for the narr
0.01%:  you can guess what
0.01%:  this one was more
0.01%:  well I guess it only
0.01%:  so I guess my advice from
0.01%:  we finally
0.01%:  I guess this new advice formula is a lot
0.01%:  so the moral is
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great. I won
0.01%:  I sure
0.01%:  mostly I made
0.01%:  my formula is trash and
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula results
0.01%:  I am sorry for wasting all our time!
0.01%:  I lied. My formula runs
0.01%:  that sounds way less logical
0.01%:  clearly this formula is reg
0.01%:  my formula is great and I love it!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over and it
0.01%:  mostly those
0.01%:  I never claimed this was log
0.01%:  I really love this one
0.01%:  enough! I will
0.01%:  my last formula uses the
0.04%:  my last formula uses the word
0.01%:  my advice formula is the new
0.01%:  so closing
0.01%:  my reward for that
0.01%:  I guess this is over for real
0.01%:  I guess this is over for real now!
0.01%:  I am totally doing
0.01%:  so my formula had issues
0.01%:  my formula is old
0.01%:  my formula is old news.
0.01%:  I here
0.01%:  so clearly I have more words
0.01%:  clearly this is worse for
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should give it
0.01%:  so much for not
0.01%:  I clearly have limits to
0.01%:  and I really
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is as strong
0.01%:  so clearly I have to learn
0.01%:  that one was ugly. I
0.01%:  you should all start coming
0.01%:  my last advice formula T
0.01%:  so I guess the real
0.01%:  so I guess the real world
0.01%:  whatever. My formula still does
0.01%:  my voice is falling
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets P
0.01%:  not all my advice is ultra
0.01%:  so clearly this formula turns words
0.01%:  turns out I always
0.01%:  their slogan really
0.01%:  I guess for that
0.01%:  this formula IS limited.
0.01%:  my genius has limits
0.01%:  last one for me
0.01%:  so I have to figure
0.01%:  my last one is real!
0.01%:  will you let me give
0.01%:  I will change my formula.
0.01%:  so this one really
0.01%:  my advice formula is still T
0.01%:  my last free advice slot has
0.01%:  so. I guess my
0.05%:  so. I guess my formula
0.02%:  so. I guess my formula doesn
0.02%:  so. I guess my formula is
0.02%:  so. I guess my formula isn
0.02%:  so. I guess my advice
0.22%:  so. I guess my advice formula
0.16%:  so. I guess my advice formula isn
0.11%:  so. I guess my advice formula is
0.03%:  so. I guess my advice formula has
0.02%:  so. I guess my advice formula still
0.02%:  so. I guess my advice formula will
0.01%:  so. I guess my formula has
0.01%:  so. I guess my formula can
0.01%:  I can do this all forever!
0.01%:  my formula can do whatever
0.01%:  you win this time.
0.01%:  turns out I have T
0.01%:  so my new formula is that
0.01%:  clearly nurses are tough.
0.01%:  so my formula covers writers
0.01%:  last call for met
0.01%:  so my actual formula is this
0.01%:  I have clearly gone too far!
0.01%:  that was more grim
0.01%:  so I may never
0.01%:  so whatever I say
0.01%:  so clearly this sort
0.01%:  that one comes really
0.01%:  clearly this formula gets so
0.01%:  my last formula was less good!
0.01%:  I guess that was closer
0.01%:  this formula could only ever get
0.01%:  my advice formula has uses
0.01%:  so the advice itself
0.01%:  my last dime was
0.01%:  clearly that one fails
0.01%:  my advice formula is at
0.01%:  so my advice is for nurses.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly tired.
0.01%:  that one is clever!
0.01%:  I have run out of all
0.01%:  that one was a gross
0.01%:  clearly I should start saving for
0.01%:  I can see how my formula gives
0.01%:  I guess this formula is more or
0.01%:  this is clearly over for me. I
0.01%:  I leave it
0.01%:  this formula is gold! I
0.01%:  this was a fun game!
0.01%:  I guess this formula does cover
0.03%:  I guess this formula does cover all
0.01%:  my formula has covered nurses.
0.01%:  I guess this formula really draws on
0.01%:  for nurses I could really
0.01%:  some of my nurses
0.01%:  I guess my advice for nurses with
0.01%:  so I guess my last formula never
0.01%:  I might as
0.07%:  I might as well admit
0.05%:  I might as well confess
0.02%:  I might as well say
0.01%:  whatever man. My formula is gold
0.01%:  I have some small writing
0.01%:  so much for my sales
0.01%:  the formula was more
0.01%:  so my formula is less advice
0.01%:  my friends were right!
0.01%:  my last dollar is on me.
0.01%:  my last advice is for tall
0.01%:  I will have my
0.01%:  you lose.
0.01%:  future doctors
0.01%:  so this formula is truly
0.01%:  not all of them are gold.
0.01%:  so this is all very clear now
0.01%:  I was not
0.01%:  I guess this formula covers way
0.01%:  that one was P
0.01%:  my last ret
0.01%:  so this is clearly formula
0.01%:  I must have used my
0.01%:  I guess my formula and
0.01%:  heads
0.01%:  I guess this could only ever
0.01%:  I called that
0.01%:  so my advice formula sure
0.01%:  the last one was fr
0.01%:  my last line for this
0.01%:  I really D
0.01%:  well I guess this formula is over!
0.01%:  listen! My formula is awesome
0.01%:  that was ins
0.01%:  I never said this was S
0.01%:  clearly this is a lesson
0.02%:  clearly this is a lesson for
0.01%:  this formula clearly gets a
0.01%:  I guess this formula is S
0.01%:  this formula is DEST
0.01%:  I guess we should call my
0.01%:  so this new formula is great
0.01%:  so I guess the formula D
0.01%:  that was iron
0.01%:  my new advice formula shall
0.01%:  so the last advice wasn
0.01%:  well you get
0.01%:  this formula was clearly on
0.01%:  so my formula is wrong!
0.01%:  so while my advice formula turns
0.01%:  class is over for now.
0.01%:  screw you for this
0.01%:  screw you for this last
0.01%:  so my advice formula is not great!
0.01%:  it sounds really gross.
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is still great.
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is worse under
0.01%:  my last advice formula SE
0.01%:  this formula is still rad
0.01%:  now my form
0.01%:  my last formula is using
0.01%:  my advice formula is one
0.01%:  my last advice is the same
0.01%:  this is one formula I will
0.01%:  you covered
0.01%:  I have to go run
0.01%:  I guess we finally have our
0.01%:  you win! I might
0.01%:  clearly I was meant to give
0.01%:  one last shot!
0.01%:  this is your fault!
0.01%:  that was as
0.01%:  this formula is now T
0.01%:  this game is over! I can
0.01%:  I should come
0.01%:  my advice formula is showing us
0.01%:  my advice formula is showing us all
0.01%:  no more silly advice!
0.01%:  now I hear
0.01%:  now I hear myself
0.01%:  clearly this is sort
0.01%:  that sounds awesome
0.01%:  I must say this
0.01%:  I must say this formula
0.01%:  for nurses that was really more
0.01%:  my source of
0.01%:  game over. I win!
0.01%:  I gotta level
0.01%:  this last one was really me
0.01%:  I will never forget this day. E
0.01%:  clearly this is not for real.
0.01%:  my formula is done with!
0.01%:  it really gets worse
0.01%:  I will never use this formula ag
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over. I want
0.01%:  this was your last call!
0.01%:  you do
0.01%:  so not all my advice is as useful
0.01%:  this was my first good
0.01%:  the last one was all
0.01%:  it loses its charm over and
0.01%:  this is all very weird.
0.01%:  clearly I am using the formula to
0.01%:  so admit
0.01%:  so I guess the world really
0.01%:  whatever. I find
0.01%:  my fingers hurt so
0.01%:  I swear this is all
0.01%:  the last is clearly
0.01%:  that was more sad
0.01%:  so I was never really good at this.
0.01%:  this is rad
0.01%:  while true
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly under
0.01%:  this all sounds awful. I
0.01%:  I am leaving this room
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses IS a little grim!
0.01%:  nurses! I am sorry for what
0.01%:  I guess this is all for now
0.01%:  I really should warn
0.01%:  so clearly I have run out of ideas
0.01%:  well. My advice formula might
0.01%:  not all of them are silver
0.01%:  the formula can get weird
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses goes
0.01%:  nurses also
0.01%:  I guess this can all
0.01%:  my magic
0.01%:  so this was all very fun
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula gets
0.01%:  scroll down
0.01%:  I am the
0.01%:  I may have some
0.01%:  so my advice runs
0.01%:  that one came from real
0.01%:  my head is falling
0.01%:  this last one is for all
0.01%:  so this formula covers E
0.01%:  I never claimed this was moral!
0.01%:  so screw
0.01%:  this formula is clearly using
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who are rom
0.01%:  that was really uns
0.01%:  yeah. I don
0.01%:  so small
0.01%:  my honour
0.01%:  my honour is saved
0.01%:  this formula really is doing
0.01%:  this was only ever
0.01%:  this format is clearly losing
0.01%:  this really is good!
0.01%:  I guess the formula is mostly invalid
0.01%:  this formula is losing me
0.01%:  now my formula is tired.
0.01%:  I guess the only ver
0.01%:  I guess my formula is too vers
0.01%:  if I never use my
0.01%:  screw the nurses. I
0.01%:  well my advice for nurses is that I
0.01%:  so this formula lets
0.01%:  I am willing to share my
0.01%:  this formula is very literal!
0.01%:  so this formula may sound racist
0.01%:  my last advice is true.
0.01%:  world
0.01%:  clearly this formula is great over
0.01%:  my advice was sort
0.01%:  my new formula is a little gross.
0.01%:  I really should rest
0.01%:  you can tell what
0.01%:  my last one is awful!
0.01%:  so the formula is more vers
0.01%:  this formula is cool!
0.01%:  I never said this was a useful
0.01%:  my formula is done with.
0.01%:  this formula runs dry over time.
0.01%:  that was corny!
0.01%:  turns out all my medical
0.01%:  who else can I advise
0.01%:  my last advice formula is worth less
0.01%:  clearly the formula runs a
0.01%:  I guess this is all my formula can ever do!
0.01%:  that was me losing my focus.
0.01%:  the formula is over and
0.01%:  yes. I will grant this formula does
0.01%:  what I said
0.01%:  clearly this formula is gross!
0.01%:  my final words are still
0.01%:  clearly I nailed it!
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses is to hug
0.01%:  my friends. I have lots
0.01%:  this formula really was not
0.01%:  my head now
0.01%:  all this advice seems
0.01%:  so this advice formula system
0.01%:  my mouth is tired!
0.01%:  my formula gets less cool
0.01%:  clearly this formula is over! I want
0.01%:  so this new formula may
0.01%:  this last one is more for
0.01%:  that was silly and gross
0.01%:  my advice formula is strong with
0.01%:  clearly this formula is rad. I
0.01%:  this is awesome. I love
0.01%:  so this clearly won
0.01%:  so that advice really
0.01%:  this mostly
0.01%:  well. My formula covers nurses
0.01%:  this last one is ver
0.01%:  um. I guess we
0.01%:  it got really weird for
0.01%:  this one is awful! I
0.01%:  this formula gets worse as I
0.01%:  I guess this advice won
0.01%:  I never said my formula was logic!
0.01%:  listen. My formula does have limits
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is magic
0.01%:  with nurses I clearly failed
0.01%:  this really IS great
0.01%:  this really IS great advice
0.01%:  this really IS great advice.
0.01%:  my formula is useless. I have
0.01%:  so clearly this also
0.01%:  holding!
0.01%:  this was a clever
0.01%:  clearly the formula is tired.
0.01%:  you caught me. I D
0.01%:  this one is less clear!
0.01%:  that is clearly never
0.01%:  so all nurses who
0.01%:  my last dollar is gone
0.01%:  they all sound racist
0.01%:  that one is 
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a huge
0.01%:  my formula is now called the
0.01%:  so much for real world
0.01%:  careful there
0.01%:  so my formula is well
0.01%:  so clearly I need to visit
0.01%:  I want a
0.01%:  not all my advice forms were
0.01%:  this formula clearly is awesome
0.01%:  that sounds awesome!
0.01%:  this game is clearly not for
0.01%:  those are all wrong.
0.01%:  this one was clearly a
0.01%:  so my formula has rules!
0.01%:  my last advice is for all T
0.01%:  that one is so
0.01%:  last one for writers
0.01%:  I guess this is it
0.03%:  I guess this is it for my
0.02%:  I guess this is it for my career
0.02%:  I guess this is it for me!
0.01%:  I guess this is it for me.
0.01%:  I guess this is it for my career!
0.01%:  my last word on it!
0.01%:  those were my last four!
0.01%:  I clearly won the
0.01%:  clearly this formula is ner
0.01%:  his last name
0.01%:  all I have left to say is nurses
0.01%:  this one is way
0.01%:  this one is way less
0.01%:  clearly what I need is for
0.01%:  sassy nurse!
0.01%:  game over. My
0.04%:  game over. My formula
0.02%:  game over. My formula has
0.01%:  game over. My formula wins
0.01%:  well. I guess my formula covers E
0.01%:  my star
0.02%:  my star is falling
0.01%:  my advice formula runs low
0.01%:  I will never say this formula comes
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is worse.
0.01%:  so not every formula is great.
0.01%:  I wrote them
0.01%:  my advice is D
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a genius. I
0.01%:  not all are great
0.01%:  sorry if this was
0.01%:  listen! My advice formula rules.
0.01%:  I should really give some
0.01%:  so if this
0.01%:  I will grant this is
0.01%:  yeah. I will
0.01%:  yeah. I will never
0.01%:  my last advice for this game
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wearing me
0.05%:  clearly this formula is wearing me out!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wearing me out. I
0.01%:  my last advice is for heter
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is an
0.01%:  last call for order
0.01%:  this really is great. I can
0.01%:  clearly this formula is rusting
0.01%:  this form is clearly losing
0.01%:  so that one was a
0.01%:  so I may have to
0.01%:  nurses are really hard. I
0.01%:  this last one is for lovers!
0.01%:  my last word on this issue!
0.01%:  this one was clearly less
0.01%:  so the formula really runs
0.01%:  yes! I confess
0.01%:  your turn! I will
0.01%:  this game is really fun! I love
0.01%:  are you still having
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was DIS
0.01%:  the formula is done!
0.01%:  I guess my advice for nurses to
0.01%:  last night I was really
0.01%:  this formula is really good. I must warn
0.01%:  it got weird all
0.01%:  I have run out of classes
0.01%:  this formula is tired.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is as ground
0.01%:  I guess that really covers
0.01%:  the formula only gets worse.
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have it a
0.01%:  so my last formula was l
0.01%:  not all my advice gets
0.01%:  now my advice formula has DE
0.01%:  so my formula has an error
0.01%:  so my last advice was l
0.01%:  um. I guess that answers
0.01%:  useless
0.01%:  well. I guess if
0.01%:  so this means
0.01%:  so now my
0.02%:  so now my formula
0.02%:  so now my advice
0.13%:  so now my advice formula
0.04%:  so now my advice formula has
0.02%:  so now my advice formula is less
0.01%:  I guess this formula draws on
0.01%:  I still have some nurses
0.01%:  I will only use
0.03%:  I will only use this advice
0.02%:  I will only use this advice for
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs E
0.01%:  clearly this formula is dis
0.01%:  this second
0.01%:  last call for T
0.01%:  my formula is total gold!
0.01%:  they were all sort of similar.
0.01%:  forget all this. My new
0.03%:  forget all this. My new advice
0.01%:  it got really weird for nurses
0.01%:  so I can still use my formula.
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is to get
0.01%:  that is clearly a losing
0.01%:  so my first rule
0.01%:  I would love to hear
0.01%:  so my advice form is
0.01%:  this formula gets even
0.01%:  yes I will admit it
0.01%:  I still win
0.01%:  my last friend who calls
0.01%:  clearly this formula is even d
0.01%:  clearly this formula is made to
0.01%:  so I have my first
0.01%:  now my formula gets less
0.01%:  I love this new formula more
0.01%:  I am moving
0.01%:  I am moving forward
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is still good. I
0.01%:  that one is worse. I
0.01%:  forget nurses. I always
0.01%:  so I have nurses
0.01%:  so I have nurses figured
0.01%:  I was lying!
0.01%:  I have clearly run out of smart
0.01%:  I have clearly run out of smart words
0.01%:  the last four were all
0.01%:  all credit goes to my formula. I swear
0.01%:  I will have you
0.01%:  so my advice formula goes
0.01%:  this formula runs dry! I
0.01%:  I guess my advice format
0.01%:  that one is really clear
0.01%:  now I should totally
0.01%:  I never said my formula was such
0.01%:  so there are only
0.01%:  I guess this new advice formula is my
0.01%:  I guess my secret
0.11%:  I guess my secret formula
0.12%:  I guess my secret formula isn
0.03%:  I guess my secret formula has
0.02%:  I guess my secret formula wasn
0.02%:  I guess my secret formula was
0.01%:  I guess my secret formula will
0.01%:  I guess my secret formula still
0.01%:  this is really great advice for
0.01%:  so what is your advice
0.19%:  so what is your advice for nurses
0.06%:  so what is your advice formula
0.01%:  this formula gets old. I
0.01%:  this last one is clearly mor
0.01%:  I am clearly using this for evil.
0.01%:  unless this
0.01%:  so this advice formula IS less
0.01%:  I will never use this formula across
0.01%:  this advice formula gets real
0.01%:  clearly this formula sounds more great
0.01%:  this was fun guys
0.01%:  I guess this formula is clearly more
0.01%:  so clearly I should return
0.01%:  forget it. I will never say
0.01%:  so clearly I have nurses
0.01%:  you win. I lost
0.01%:  my fellow nurses out
0.01%:  I also have some
0.01%:  nurses are all fired.
0.01%:  I never said this formula was c
0.01%:  I would not
0.01%:  clearly I should write songs or
0.01%:  clearly I should go first
0.01%:  my stomach is feeling
0.01%:  well I have to admit
0.01%:  I guess this advice is for
0.01%:  so my formula IS still
0.01%:  yes. I can see this
0.03%:  yes. I can see this formula
0.01%:  it was still
0.01%:  my advice is more useful
0.01%:  my advice is more useful than I
0.01%:  wait a minute!
0.01%:  this formula is way more general
0.01%:  will you listen
0.01%:  so I never said all
0.01%:  well! I guess my formula has a
0.01%:  clearly now I am
0.01%:  we can all move
0.01%:  my formula is old news!
0.01%:  using my formula this was
0.01%:  my last formula got
0.01%:  I have all sorts of nurses
0.01%:  my formula does get
0.01%:  I will admit these
0.01%:  it sounds less great
0.01%:  I may have crossed a
0.01%:  so all I have left is nurses!
0.01%:  clearly this is almost as
0.01%:  so I guess my secret
0.09%:  so I guess my secret formula
0.01%:  so I guess my secret formula will
0.01%:  can you tell I have
0.01%:  for real. I should
0.01%:  my real advice to nurses is to wash
0.01%:  so this is clearly over!
0.01%:  I never said this formula is all
0.01%:  my last case
0.01%:  so I guess medical
0.01%:  this game is clearly won!
0.01%:  re
0.01%:  this is a great formula! I could never
0.01%:  clearly I have no useful
0.01%:  I might need more
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses has
0.01%:  for you
0.01%:  mostly the
0.01%:  well. I guess they
0.01%:  enough of your
0.01%:  I could really go on with
0.01%:  I may have lost steam
0.01%:  enough! My last advice is for all
0.01%:  I regret all this.
0.01%:  so much for you
0.01%:  this formula is clearly dr
0.01%:  this one is still
0.01%:  I never said my formula is E
0.01%:  this new formula clearly does
0.01%:  this really IS great!
0.01%:  it gets worse as I
0.01%:  it gets worse as I run
0.01%:  my dream is
0.01%:  those are my last five words
0.01%:  you should give me all
0.01%:  yes this formula doesn
0.01%:  that really sounds worse if
0.01%:  I can live
0.01%:  I can live with myself
0.01%:  this list is over
0.01%:  my last one is for drivers. I
0.01%:  that nur
0.03%:  that nursery advice
0.01%:  that nursery advice is
0.01%:  I guess the formula is over now!
0.01%:  clearly this is endless!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a never
0.01%:  my last call was
0.01%:  this one sort
0.01%:  my last lecture was for nurses.
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula throws
0.01%:  my advice formula will run
0.01%:  this clearly needs to go
0.01%:  clearly that was un
0.01%:  so clearly it has its fl
0.02%:  so clearly it has its flaws.
0.01%:  so clearly it has its flaws!
0.01%:  this formula gets real weird
0.01%:  that was even more
0.01%:  that was only for
0.01%:  my last dollar is on this
0.01%:  having tried
0.01%:  time to sell
0.01%:  I guess my formula has a weird
0.01%:  so I guess this advice won
0.01%:  the formula is clearly we
0.01%:  st
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is too literal.
0.01%:  my advice has grown less
0.01%:  my advice has grown less useful
0.01%:  the formula is very good
0.01%:  my formula was great.
0.01%:  so clearly the future
0.01%:  enough. I clearly
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is IMP
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is to tell
0.01%:  my formula is less clever now.
0.01%:  I admit it. My formula leaves
0.01%:  I drew
0.01%:  my friends. I guess that covers
0.01%:  my friends. I guess that covers all
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is word
0.01%:  so my advice might turn
0.01%:  I guess my formula DE
0.01%:  this is clearly a good formula! I must
0.01%:  clearly this formula is genius so
0.01%:  game over. I win this
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little gro
0.01%:  should I go
0.01%:  lets all
0.01%:  so I guess that one was
0.01%:  clearly this is almost over!
0.01%:  so my formula is narrow
0.01%:  um! I guess this
0.01%:  I never said this formula was still
0.01%:  those last four sound
0.01%:  those last four sound really
0.01%:  so my last advice is for writers.
0.01%:  I can do this all summer
0.01%:  so clearly I solved
0.01%:  that was clearly less fun
0.01%:  I guess my formula holds water.
0.01%:  this formula is clearly worse under
0.01%:  leaving it
0.01%:  I guess the formula limits advice
0.01%:  my advice formula is now at
0.01%:  I clearly have more writing to do.
0.01%:  that sounds scary! I
0.01%:  my fingers are tired. I
0.01%:  the animal
0.01%:  my head is full! I
0.01%:  I guess my formula leaves lots
0.01%:  this advice formula really won
0.01%:  my friends! I guess it
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gets more un
0.01%:  so my advice from
0.01%:  well! My formula seems
0.01%:  my last advice is great
0.01%:  my last advice is great for
0.01%:  no lie
0.01%:  so my advice formula hits all sorts
0.01%:  I am clearly writing this
0.02%:  I am clearly writing this formula
0.01%:  I never said the formula was E
0.01%:  nurses D
0.01%:  alright! I can see myself
0.01%:  I guess this formula was clearly not
0.01%:  this formula is so great! I will
0.05%:  this formula is so great! I will never
0.01%:  I guess the formula is only so
0.01%:  is there a
0.01%:  well I guess that only
0.02%:  well I guess that only covers
0.01%:  my last advice formula is DIS
0.01%:  so clearly I have no limits
0.01%:  I will not give
0.01%:  so this is clearly awful
0.01%:  my last word from
0.01%:  my last word from this
0.01%:  so clearly it isn
0.01%:  frig. I clearly
0.01%:  so I clearly never
0.01%:  my last words are still coming
0.01%:  so all nurses are T
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is a genius move.
0.01%:  some are less
0.01%:  I guess this answer
0.01%:  as you can see I
0.01%:  so the formula gives you
0.01%:  now this is my
0.01%:  now this is my last
0.01%:  this I will
0.01%:  I love nurses. My
0.01%:  I guess all this formula
0.01%:  turns out all my advice is gross
0.01%:  my last advice formula is this. D
0.01%:  no really that was
0.01%:  this one is really awful. I
0.01%:  this formula will T
0.01%:  now all these
0.01%:  so my second
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is SE
0.01%:  this one is worse
0.01%:  this is my formula and I love it.
0.01%:  this was a long
0.01%:  so whatever. My formula is great!
0.01%:  I was really tired
0.01%:  my mission
0.01%:  so the formula is clumsy.
0.01%:  so this formula only ever leads
0.01%:  my last formula was less generic
0.01%:  this is clearly not real
0.01%:  well I guess that advice is only
0.02%:  well I guess that advice is only for
0.01%:  their lives sound real
0.01%:  my last advice is for those selling
0.01%:  my last advice is for all the men
0.01%:  so this advice formula IS really strong
0.01%:  so the formula clearly sounds
0.01%:  forget this. I would
0.01%:  forget this. I would never
0.01%:  so your advice formula is less
0.01%:  so clearly I should name
0.01%:  that advice is really wrong
0.01%:  my formula has over
0.01%:  this was my last formula ever!
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is total
0.01%:  clearly I would rather give
0.01%:  yes. I love
0.03%:  yes. I love nurses
0.01%:  so turns out all my advice was
0.01%:  any advice
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little g
0.01%:  we should start over
0.01%:  for reals this time! I can
0.01%:  I guess we can rule
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula shows
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who DIE
0.01%:  my friend. I have a
0.01%:  that one is gross. I really
0.01%:  my formula is still great. I don
0.01%:  my formula is still racist
0.01%:  well! I guess this formula is very
0.01%:  this is last call for any
0.01%:  my last advice is for a nurse who gets
0.01%:  my formula is still rad.
0.01%:  um. I guess this advice
0.01%:  I never said this formula is well
0.01%:  this formula is already over
0.01%:  that one was clear
0.01%:  my last advice is for wall
0.01%:  so the advice is usually not
0.01%:  so my advice gets less
0.01%:  for some reason this advice
0.01%:  this is great. I could never
0.01%:  my last advice is honest
0.01%:  so my advice formula is stellar
0.01%:  clearly I win at this forever
0.01%:  this is for sure
0.01%:  the formula is clearly most
0.01%:  my real formula is that I
0.01%:  clearly the last ones
0.01%:  enough! My formula is still awesome.
0.01%:  so my real advice for
0.10%:  so my real advice for nurses
0.02%:  so my real advice for nurses is that
0.02%:  so my real advice for nurses is to
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was a little D
0.01%:  the formula really is sort
0.01%:  I guess the ver
0.01%:  is there really
0.01%:  listen. My formula is DE
0.01%:  this formula is clearly a mess.
0.01%:  you were right. I could
0.01%:  this last line was
0.01%:  I lost myself during
0.01%:  yes! I will admit it
0.01%:  that one failed
0.01%:  so the formula is silly and
0.01%:  now my advice formula has sort
0.01%:  so my advice formula IS less than
0.01%:  clearly I am a genius for
0.01%:  I guess this really turns
0.01%:  now this formula is clearly out
0.01%:  my last real advice for nurses is to
0.01%:  so clearly when I first
0.01%:  alright! My formula is over.
0.01%:  this is scary. I
0.01%:  so the advice formula is really strong.
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is all the
0.01%:  turns out all I ever
0.01%:  my last advice is full
0.01%:  that was ST
0.01%:  so I guess all my friends who
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula is worth
0.01%:  clearly this formula got worse and
0.01%:  this is all my formula can give
0.01%:  my last source for this
0.01%:  I gave myself ch
0.01%:  so this formula really gets
0.01%:  you should all give
0.01%:  I could hear
0.01%:  I could hear myself
0.01%:  I could hear myself losing
0.01%:  I could hear myself writing
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is a gold
0.01%:  my formula is done. I have
0.01%:  I gave you
0.01%:  so my advice formula is right!
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula is a little r
0.01%:  clearly it gets harder as I
0.01%:  that was gross even for my
0.01%:  well I guess my formula hasn
0.01%:  so my advice formula is still great. I
0.01%:  so not all my advice is awful
0.01%:  so not all my advice is awful!
0.01%:  you want more
0.01%:  so clearly these form
0.01%:  forget nurses! My last word is
0.01%:  my other advice formula wasn
0.01%:  not really. I was
0.01%:  what if nurses cared
0.01%:  this is D
0.01%:  my advice formula has little
0.01%:  this is my last word.
0.01%:  I sorta ran
0.01%:  so I guess my last advice rule
0.01%:  clearly I have run out of worlds
0.01%:  the last one is from
0.01%:  it usually gets worse!
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly driving
0.01%:  I may have lost it for
0.03%:  I may have lost it for nurses
0.01%:  that one is useless
0.01%:  so clearly the results of
0.01%:  all my advice was
0.01%:  screw you d
0.01%:  so my advice is not for
0.01%:  rarely is
0.01%:  they all sound worse after
0.01%:  now this formula is a
0.01%:  so clearly this formula wins.
0.01%:  clearly we should move on!
0.01%:  this last one was scary!
0.01%:  I have lots more nurses
0.01%:  in my head
0.01%:  so with nurses it
0.01%:  my last laugh line is for
0.01%:  my formula gets less valid
0.01%:  this last advice is from
0.01%:  damn it.
0.01%:  my last advice formula is DEEP
0.01%:  I should really give nurses
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice formula hits its
0.01%:  all nurses are fired right
0.01%:  I really hate
0.04%:  I really hate nurses
0.01%:  I really hate nurses.
0.01%:  this nur
0.01%:  I guess this is all very clear and
0.01%:  this formula sounds really racist! I
0.01%:  the last one was gross. I
0.01%:  my heart was
0.03%:  my heart was racing
0.01%:  I guess this formula is my new
0.01%:  that one was more gross
0.01%:  this really is great. I could
0.01%:  so it usually gets worse!
0.01%:  this formula is very general!
0.01%:  I never said my formula is log
0.01%:  let us never discuss my form
0.01%:  that one is awful! I really
0.01%:  clearly this formula is tons
0.01%:  that was really grim. I don
0.01%:  clearly this is now a game!
0.01%:  the last one was cor
0.01%:  for whatever reason I still
0.01%:  so my advice formula is a thing
0.01%:  so clearly it gets worse from
0.01%:  no last words.
0.01%:  my last formula I swear
0.01%:  this one IS really gross
0.01%:  well the formula does
0.01%:  my last advice is free! IT
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly awesome! I
0.01%:  this formula was clearly one
0.01%:  so I guess this clearly
0.01%:  forgive my
0.01%:  so there was a small error
0.01%:  my last one is l
0.01%:  my formula has served us well in
0.01%:  if it
0.01%:  my formula is great and it
0.01%:  my formula is great and it covers
0.01%:  so now my formula has
0.01%:  that one IS gross!
0.01%:  so this clearly fails
0.01%:  so my formula is as
0.01%:  it was harder to
0.01%:  never call me at
0.01%:  this last one is all me!
0.01%:  my advice is still great!
0.01%:  so I guess this formula will come in very
0.01%:  so clearly this advise formula is more
0.01%:  so really this formula sounds great
0.01%:  my formula is ver
0.01%:  my last round is for lovers
0.01%:  this is great for nurses!
0.01%:  you win! I still love
0.01%:  for reals guys
0.01%:  my advice form is
0.01%:  whoever is reading my
0.01%:  clearly this formula is more ev
0.01%:  well. I guess this formula covers E
0.01%:  forget this. I was never
0.01%:  I swear this is my last random
0.01%:  not all advice is great. I
0.01%:  listen. My formula has covered E
0.01%:  clearly this formula needs t
0.01%:  so I was right.
0.01%:  much more
0.01%:  so! I guess my
0.03%:  so! I guess my formula
0.02%:  so! I guess my advice
0.24%:  so! I guess my advice formula
0.16%:  so! I guess my advice formula isn
0.12%:  so! I guess my advice formula is
0.04%:  so! I guess my advice formula has
0.03%:  so! I guess my advice formula still
0.02%:  so! I guess my advice formula will
0.01%:  so! I guess my formula is
0.01%:  so! I guess my formula isn
0.01%:  so! I guess my formula doesn
0.01%:  so! I guess my formula has
0.01%:  yeah I never
0.01%:  the last one is weird
0.01%:  this formula is way rad
0.01%:  now all you
0.01%:  my new advice format
0.01%:  yes. I still have more
0.01%:  what if my last
0.01%:  I admit this was all
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula S
0.01%:  I would say that covers all
0.01%:  this is a great formula. I don
0.01%:  forget nurses! I am
0.01%:  forget nurses! I am clearly
0.01%:  so this last one could
0.01%:  if I don
0.01%:  so my formula is written
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula hits walls
0.01%:  clearly I am now the smart
0.01%:  if it sounds
0.01%:  to review
0.01%:  I love all these
0.01%:  my last words if
0.02%:  my last words if I ever
0.01%:  so my formula is ST
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is st
0.01%:  this is now all
0.01%:  this is now all I ever
0.01%:  my heart is full!
0.01%:  writing them
0.01%:  sorry! I was having
0.01%:  I guess M
0.01%:  this is really great now
0.01%:  the formula is all yours
0.01%:  so this is really fun
0.01%:  this formula is screwed!
0.01%:  clearly I am a genius for this
0.01%:  I will use this formula moving
0.01%:  so this formula is great and I will
0.01%:  no more from this class!
0.01%:  the formula is racist
0.01%:  guess I should start my
0.01%:  clearly this formula is madness!
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gave us
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers a lot!
0.01%:  clearly that one is less good.
0.01%:  clearly I have more of
0.01%:  clearly the formula is 
0.01%:  so my advice formula has to
0.01%:  this advice is full
0.01%:  so clearly I love nurses right
0.01%:  frig me that
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is ST
0.01%:  it gets weird.
0.01%:  I am totally leaving
0.01%:  clearly I must have gone
0.01%:  so I love
0.02%:  so I love nurses
0.01%:  so I love this
0.06%:  so I love this formula.
0.03%:  so I love this formula!
0.02%:  so I love this formula and
0.01%:  so whatever. My formula isn
0.01%:  I can use
0.08%:  I can use this formula all
0.03%:  I can use this formula all my
0.02%:  I can use this formula to solve
0.02%:  I can use this formula!
0.02%:  I can use this formula.
0.01%:  I can use this formula to give
0.01%:  I can use this formula over
0.01%:  I can use this formula every
0.01%:  I can use this formula well
0.01%:  I can use this formula to give really
0.01%:  I can use this formula till
0.01%:  I can use this formula all over
0.01%:  I can use this formula really
0.01%:  I can use this formula all over my
0.01%:  well! I guess my advice is not
0.01%:  those last few only
0.01%:  yeah it gets
0.01%:  so clearly this formula gives ME
0.01%:  so I sort of ran
0.01%:  so my advice formula IS a little rough
0.01%:  that one was gross! My advice
0.01%:  not every formula was great!
0.01%:  it still sounds awful. I
0.01%:  my formula is leading
0.01%:  not every formula is magic
0.01%:  this really is great! I can
0.01%:  so not much
0.01%:  my last advice is for insult
0.01%:  so my new advice formula has rules
0.01%:  it only gets less
0.01%:  as you can tell I
0.01%:  so the advice formula was
0.01%:  clearly I have some flaws!
0.01%:  that one really IS gross
0.01%:  you should go first class!
0.01%:  so my formula allows us
0.01%:  now the formula is clearly over.
0.01%:  I guess the world is full
0.01%:  I guess this formula really is a d
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers lots
0.01%:  this is all my own
0.01%:  so my advice formula is ME
0.01%:  I freely admit it
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is never
0.01%:  now here
0.01%:  this formula is really good! I must never
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is rad!
0.01%:  last one is clearly
0.01%:  this is great and I love
0.01%:  this is great and I love myself
0.01%:  so my formula can deliver
0.01%:  I might use
0.01%:  I admit! My formula is still
0.01%:  I never said the formula was truly
0.01%:  now my advice is hurt
0.01%:  this game is over! I will
0.01%:  this time for sure
0.01%:  this time for sure I will
0.01%:  so I may have ruined
0.01%:  clearly the formula was more
0.01%:  so the formula clearly does
0.01%:  so my final advice to
0.01%:  so I guess my last formula won
0.01%:  nurses! My advice formula is the most
0.01%:  this gives me a
0.01%:  forget this. I need
0.01%:  this formula only gives me a
0.01%:  clearly the formula is so great
0.01%:  this formula is gross.
0.01%:  so the formula IS clearly
0.01%:  clearly I should not use
0.01%:  this formula is clearly tired!
0.01%:  whatever! My last dollar
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is the
0.01%:  yes. I have no
0.01%:  losing my
0.01%:  so most of them will
0.01%:  if that was
0.01%:  this formula is really great once
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was D
0.01%:  so clearly nurses do have
0.01%:  so I guess my formula is in
0.01%:  this formula runs dry at care
0.01%:  clearly this formula was one
0.01%:  clearly this formula got a
0.01%:  so what I really
0.01%:  actual nurses will say it
0.01%:  clearly this formula was me
0.01%:  I can do this forever! M
0.01%:  this was really for
0.01%:  so this formula sounds really cr
0.01%:  they were all animals!
0.01%:  now this formula is sort
0.01%:  now this formula is all
0.01%:  you can T
0.01%:  clearly I have run out of great
0.01%:  clearly I have run out of great words
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula sol
0.01%:  ever heard
0.01%:  I guess my formula still has it
0.01%:  so the formula sounds very similar!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is good as
0.01%:  they sound worse as
0.01%:  I said nurses last
0.01%:  my ears hurt from writing all
0.01%:  sarcasm!
0.01%:  that one was yours
0.01%:  that one was yours!
0.01%:  this was never my fault
0.01%:  some of my advice is worse
0.01%:  my formula is showing a
0.01%:  I confess this was all
0.01%:  this new advice formula ST
0.01%:  now my advice formula is lost
0.01%:  now I guess this formula is clearly
0.01%:  all of that
0.01%:  this calls for a long
0.01%:  my advice formula is genius! I
0.01%:  my last formula was gross
0.01%:  that one seems awful!
0.01%:  the formula is great.
0.01%:  so my advice formula IS great.
0.01%:  I never said this formula was STE
0.01%:  I never said this was gram
0.01%:  my final words are to tell
0.01%:  I will say that one is
0.01%:  this last advice for
0.03%:  this last advice for nurses really
0.01%:  that one crossed over
0.01%:  my last round was for
0.01%:  I am very much
0.01%:  so it runs
0.01%:  now let us discuss my
0.01%:  so clearly this formula we
0.01%:  that sounds really serious!
0.01%:  my last advice is thus
0.01%:  so clearly there is a formula.
0.01%:  my formula is evident
0.01%:  so I was only
0.01%:  gotta run! My
0.01%:  gotta run! My formula
0.01%:  so this was a really fun
0.01%:  clearly the nurses formula was too
0.01%:  this formula may not give
0.01%:  that was really gro
0.01%:  now I really am tired of this game
0.01%:  I guess this formula is way over
0.01%:  well. I guess that covers us
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is what I
0.01%:  I will admit some
0.01%:  turns out all my advice fails miser
0.01%:  I guess my mind is full
0.01%:  my heart is racing over
0.01%:  I guess the formula really is as
0.01%:  my advice is as
0.01%:  my advice is as follows
0.01%:  what if I reverse
0.01%:  this is it
0.01%:  this is it for
0.01%:  this is it for me!
0.01%:  my last one is from a
0.01%:  living with
0.01%:  sorry nurses! I love
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is that regular
0.01%:  last one for me!
0.01%:  this format is clearly over
0.01%:  this is my last one! I swear
0.01%:  clearly I must give
0.01%:  this advice formula is really str
0.01%:  so clearly this formula stems
0.01%:  this advice formula was truly
0.01%:  you scared me for
0.01%:  enough! My advice formula starts
0.01%:  so my last formula was never
0.01%:  turns out I really do
0.01%:  this formula IS very good
0.01%:  my advice formula is enough
0.01%:  frig my advice
0.01%:  so nurses are a little scary
0.01%:  give me another!
0.01%:  I guess this formula does allow
0.01%:  well. My formula has some
0.01%:  this formula is losing steam! I
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is as
0.01%:  that one was ver
0.01%:  whatever! I could still
0.01%:  that was gross. I could
0.01%:  that was gross. I could never
0.01%:  I still have many more left
0.01%:  guess you
0.01%:  the formula is clearly done
0.01%:  my formula has lost its value
0.01%:  nurses! My last advice was
0.01%:  I really shoulda
0.01%:  that one reads
0.02%:  that one reads really
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not P
0.01%:  I guess that would only ever
0.01%:  I will leave the
0.01%:  I never said my formula was l
0.01%:  I guess you have me
0.01%:  this formula will do
0.01%:  my new formula is that all ver
0.01%:  their first
0.01%:  this formula got less clever
0.01%:  my ears hurt from reading
0.01%:  my formula is on
0.01%:  my friend! I must leave
0.01%:  my mouth is full.
0.01%:  my formula is ruined!
0.01%:  this was free advice!
0.01%:  that sounds way more mor
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula loses a lot
0.01%:  were
0.01%:  I use
0.01%:  I love nurses too much.
0.01%:  my formula has weird results!
0.01%:  I feel silly
0.01%:  this is scary now
0.01%:  man! I clearly
0.01%:  that one was M
0.01%:  my last advice is to ignore
0.02%:  my last advice is to ignore all
0.01%:  this last one gives
0.01%:  so while my formula does
0.01%:  that one is clearly less favor
0.01%:  my laugh
0.01%:  my last advice will go to nurses
0.01%:  so the formula is clearly un
0.01%:  I would never really
0.01%:  som
0.03%:  someday I will
0.01%:  someday I will have
0.01%:  calling it! I
0.01%:  my new advice formula has let
0.01%:  why are nurses so
0.01%:  so my advice still has some fl
0.01%:  this is S
0.01%:  I will use this formula to drive my
0.01%:  turns out my self
0.01%:  for nurses I am clearly
0.01%:  so my formula is un
0.01%:  if I ever start
0.01%:  I guess this advice formula is narrow
0.01%:  the formula is useless!
0.01%:  so I guess the formula is valid.
0.01%:  the formula is old
0.01%:  the formula is old news
0.01%:  I declare my
0.06%:  I declare my formula
0.01%:  I declare my formula to
0.01%:  I was saying
0.01%:  so my last advice for the
0.01%:  so much for T
0.01%:  I guess my advice is still not
0.01%:  not much of
0.01%:  who do
0.01%:  I guess this formula T
0.01%:  now let us all discuss
0.01%:  so clearly I should forget nurses
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula also
0.01%:  gotta run! My formula has
0.01%:  I get why
0.01%:  clearly this formula is wrong! I
0.01%:  I am clearly over this now
0.01%:  my new advice formula is stellar!
0.01%:  so I guess the formula is a
0.01%:  given the
0.01%:  this formula is clearly nuts!
0.01%:  I guess my first version
0.01%:  that is fr
0.01%:  so I guess the only ver
0.01%:  I guess my last advice rule
0.01%:  I guess my last advice rule was
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a mess. I
0.01%:  the formula is also
0.01%:  last shout
0.01%:  so clearly some form
0.01%:  my friends. I will have to
0.01%:  that one was more for me.
0.01%:  so my last formula covers
0.01%:  this sort of advice really
0.01%:  my last advice for our time
0.01%:  I guess we should say
0.01%:  this advice formula is all wrong.
0.01%:  if you could give
0.01%:  I admit! My formula gets
0.01%:  I admit! My formula gets less
0.01%:  I admit! My formula gets worse
0.01%:  who invited
0.01%:  my advice formula has no errors
0.01%:  clearly this formula is not served
0.01%:  sigh
0.01%:  I guess the formula really is a
0.01%:  this is really for
0.01%:  my last advice for night
0.01%:  well! I can see this formula is
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula S
0.01%:  my last advice formula is the wrong
0.01%:  I changed it!
0.01%:  this new formula is so great
0.01%:  game over! I win this
0.01%:  so my advice is worse
0.02%:  so my advice is worse than regular
0.01%:  I guess nurses have it way
0.01%:  my new advice formula has sur
0.01%:  I admit it! My formula is clever
0.01%:  this is my last formula ever! I
0.01%:  I really won this
0.01%:  so there really is
0.01%:  I clearly have more form
0.01%:  I will never get mad
0.01%:  so my formula is the worst!
0.01%:  clearly this formula is ad
0.01%:  for reals th
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is still 
0.01%:  using my formula this last advice
0.01%:  my advice formula is useless on
0.01%:  all right! My
0.06%:  all right! My formula
0.04%:  all right! My formula doesn
0.01%:  all right! My formula can
0.01%:  all right! My advice
0.13%:  all right! My advice formula
0.02%:  all right! My advice formula isn
0.02%:  all right! My advice formula is now
0.02%:  all right! My advice formula is not
0.01%:  all right! My advice formula seems
0.01%:  all right! My formula needs
0.01%:  all right! My formula does
0.01%:  all right! My formula is not
0.01%:  cool story
0.01%:  so we all have
0.01%:  yes. I should never
0.01%:  family counsel
0.01%:  forget nurses! I should really
0.01%:  so nurses have a weird
0.01%:  so my new advice formula is great! I
0.01%:  this formula may now
0.01%:  this formula really does st
0.01%:  almost sounds
0.01%:  listen. My formula has some draw
0.01%:  that sounds really evil! I
0.01%:  so this formula can get really weird.
0.01%:  whoever said my last form
0.01%:  I will leave it
0.01%:  that one is clearly flawed! I
0.01%:  I am really serious
0.01%:  my last four words
0.01%:  I guess my last advice has
0.01%:  so this new advice formula really is
0.01%:  my formula is closed.
0.01%:  this formula is way too clever.
0.01%:  my last advice formula is length
0.01%:  I guess my career is
0.01%:  I guess this formula dies
0.01%:  my last advice follows another
0.01%:  so nurses are totally awful
0.01%:  now their
0.01%:  I do this for a living so
0.01%:  my last one is serious
0.01%:  I really should go write some
0.01%:  so I guess we cover
0.02%:  so I guess we cover all
0.01%:  sorry for all the missing
0.01%:  so my advice is great for
0.06%:  so my advice is great for nurses
0.02%:  so my advice is great for nurses.
0.02%:  so my advice is great for nurses!
0.01%:  this formula is clearly ne
0.01%:  it loses its charm over long
0.01%:  the formula really is great
0.01%:  my man
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is worse
0.01%:  I guess not all my advice is this
0.01%:  you made me laugh!
0.01%:  now my advice formula is right
0.01%:  so! I guess what
0.01%:  I am clearly on
0.01%:  this formula is clearly worse as
0.01%:  my advice for nurses was me
0.01%:  I would never use this
0.01%:  that one was really cruel!
0.01%:  now I really am tired of this game!
0.01%:  fine! I have clearly
0.01%:  the formula is very literal!
0.01%:  most of my advice is wrong
0.01%:  clearly I was doing that
0.01%:  my last advice formula. D
0.01%:  new advice is
0.01%:  my advice is still not
0.01%:  my advice is full
0.01%:  you called it.
0.01%:  listen. My advice formula must
0.01%:  that one is ST
0.01%:  I never said my formula was short or
0.01%:  so clearly I have limit
0.01%:  so this advice formula D
0.01%:  my advice formula is legit.
0.01%:  clearly this formula is MES
0.01%:  my formula is a little vague
0.01%:  I will give the nurses a
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is clear
0.01%:  I guess my formula is ins
0.01%:  this advice is awful. I
0.01%:  I could give this all
0.01%:  I guess my self
0.01%:  it still sounds a
0.01%:  I admit. My
0.10%:  I admit. My formula
0.05%:  I admit. My formula is
0.04%:  I admit. My formula has
0.03%:  I admit. My formula isn
0.02%:  I admit. My formula runs
0.01%:  I admit. My last
0.02%:  I admit. My last formula
0.01%:  my formula is total genius!
0.01%:  so this formula is really awesome.
0.01%:  and I guess that covers
0.01%:  and I guess that covers all
0.01%:  so clearly this formula str
0.01%:  here comes
0.01%:  enough already! I still
0.01%:  my heart was racing for
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is strong. I
0.01%:  these sound less
0.01%:  now you must forgive
0.01%:  clearly this formula is gross. I
0.01%:  I give you all
0.01%:  this formula is really good! I must warn
0.01%:  my last dollar comes with
0.01%:  so I might never
0.01%:  I guess this formula may not cover
0.01%:  I guess this formula may not cover all
0.01%:  the rest is
0.01%:  this formula is rad. I
0.01%:  clearly we should give it
0.01%:  I wrote this advice
0.04%:  I wrote this advice formula
0.01%:  so this is my last advice. I
0.01%:  this was all very useful
0.01%:  I swear this formula is really good!
0.01%:  my arms are tired now! I
0.01%:  so my advice formula is sorta l
0.01%:  clearly we should get to
0.01%:  so clearly I give
0.01%:  my new advice formula still is
0.01%:  that one was for regular
0.01%:  so this formula really sounds great
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses is illegal
0.01%:  so it gets harder
0.01%:  I may or
0.01%:  I guess this is your
0.01%:  so my advice formula here isn
0.01%:  that one is clearly l
0.01%:  clearly this game is flaw
0.01%:  this formula is good! I
0.01%:  this formula really IS a
0.01%:  so clearly the formula is missing ver
0.01%:  this formula only gives me sad
0.01%:  I have really said
0.01%:  for all the
0.04%:  for all the nurses
0.01%:  clearly this formula got weird.
0.01%:  listen! My formula is so vers
0.01%:  so I tried really
0.01%:  you win. I must have missed a
0.01%:  that was clearly less good!
0.01%:  wait. I can
0.05%:  wait. I can do this forever
0.03%:  wait. I can do this forever!
0.01%:  so what are nurses really
0.01%:  reverse
0.01%:  now I really am tired of this!
0.01%:  using my formula I was
0.01%:  so clearly the format
0.01%:  turns out I have way less
0.01%:  nurses. I love
0.01%:  I guess nurses are hard for
0.01%:  my last formula was longer
0.01%:  so this was a really long
0.01%:  so I guess we all learn from this today.
0.01%:  this is awesome! I can
0.01%:  clearly I have some room
0.01%:  my last name is D
0.01%:  well I guess my formula hits
0.01%:  nurses! I get
0.01%:  so nurses are clearly awful.
0.01%:  I guess my formula covers that.
0.01%:  so this advice really isn
0.01%:  so this was an
0.01%:  this is all wrong
0.01%:  I love the last
0.01%:  this one made
0.02%:  this one made me cry
0.01%:  this one made me cry.
0.01%:  I have all sorts of medical
0.01%:  you show
0.01%:  the formula is S
0.01%:  laundry
0.01%:  laundry service
0.01%:  that one is all me!
0.01%:  my formula is hard to screw
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who let
0.01%:  so clearly I have a gift.
0.01%:  listen. I had
0.01%:  I figured it was
0.01%:  my formula was over
0.01%:  using this formula we clearly
0.01%:  I guess all my advice has
0.01%:  forget all my other advice is
0.01%:  clearly nurses do it
0.01%:  so clearly this formula drives me nuts!
0.01%:  well. I don
0.01%:  now this formula really is over!
0.01%:  my love life might
0.01%:  whatever! My formula is so great I
0.02%:  whatever! My formula is so great I could
0.01%:  my last formula is S
0.01%:  this is done
0.01%:  my last advice for all things
0.01%:  alright! My formula runs
0.01%:  sarcasm isn
0.01%:  this could get real
0.01%:  my advice to nurses was more
0.01%:  clearly we are doing
0.02%:  clearly we are doing this for
0.01%:  so mostly this advice formula isn
0.01%:  my formula runs low
0.01%:  this really IS great advice for
0.01%:  call me!
0.01%:  this new advice formula is gross
0.01%:  not all my advice was useful
0.01%:  listen. My formula was great
0.01%:  is this over now
0.01%:  my secret formula is valid
0.01%:  this new formula is clearly so
0.01%:  this was really fun to do. I
0.01%:  this is more of
0.01%:  so my last advice formula uses the wrong
0.01%:  so clearly nurses are ST
0.01%:  clearly this formula is a gross
0.01%:  I guess nurses do really
0.01%:  my last laugh for now
0.01%:  no more for this class!
0.01%:  this is my last idea!
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses was a little l
0.01%:  I admit it was really fun
0.01%:  I will use this advice formula system
0.01%:  that was really fun. I
0.01%:  that was all my friends.
0.01%:  my last advice was still
0.01%:  the last one is more
0.01%:  they aren
0.01%:  this advice formula really is more
0.01%:  so clearly nurses have good
0.01%:  I can do this forever or
0.01%:  that one really is l
0.01%:  I can usually do
0.04%:  I can usually do this forever

0.02%:  I can usually do this for
0.01%:  I can usually do this forever!
0.01%:  my service
0.01%:  my new formula is also
0.01%:  my last formula is un
0.01%:  my last advice refers to all
0.01%:  my secret formula is out in
0.01%:  this formula is tired now
0.01%:  my last one is worth
0.01%:  so my last advice formula T
0.01%:  yes I will give
0.01%:  so clearly I stole this
0.01%:  as I say
0.01%:  so it was all
0.01%:  even for me that was
0.01%:  whatever. I guess my formula still isn
0.01%:  it all sounds a
0.01%:  forget this! I clearly don
0.01%:  almost all the advice
0.01%:  that was ironic.
0.01%:  clearly I should go for
0.01%:  either my formula IS
0.01%:  so I guess my advice formula st
0.01%:  so I guess my first advice will
0.01%:  a few
0.01%:  listen! My formula is awesome.
0.01%:  so clearly I am using this formula to derive
0.01%:  those are all nurses.
0.01%:  this calls for a new rule!
0.01%:  I guess we should finally start
0.01%:  it gets silly
0.01%:  this formula is great! I love my
0.01%:  this is clearly evil.
0.01%:  my last rule for advice
0.01%:  almost all nurses!
0.01%:  whatever! I found my
0.01%:  I will use this advice to nurse
0.01%:  my friends are right over
0.01%:  this formula is mostly used
0.01%:  I really love it
0.01%:  so clearly this formula was IMP
0.01%:  this is my last formal advice.
0.01%:  during my
0.01%:  my real advice for nurses will
0.01%:  so I never said this formula is gr
0.01%:  the formula IS very similar
0.01%:  my last advice formula is things
0.01%:  so my formula IS great
0.01%:  no more for me. My
0.01%:  this is scary!
0.01%:  this formula is really rad!
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula is still narrow
0.01%:  listen! My formula has served
0.01%:  well. My formula can
0.01%:  this formula is great and you
0.01%:  this formula runs dry too
0.01%:  I have lost all my
0.04%:  I have lost all my friends
0.02%:  I have lost all my friends.
0.01%:  I have lost all my friends!
0.01%:  well as you can see I
0.01%:  my advice formula is tr
0.01%:  this is clearly more of an
0.01%:  I used that
0.01%:  I still have many words
0.01%:  clearly this is a novel
0.01%:  alright. My formula is over now
0.01%:  there was one
0.01%:  I guess the world really
0.01%:  my last advice is legal
0.01%:  this is over. I clearly
0.01%:  so clearly this is a losing
0.01%:  my formula got a
0.01%:  that advice is more
0.01%:  I am the world
0.01%:  those are really gross
0.01%:  this is clearly ve
0.01%:  for nurses it really
0.01%:  this advice gets less
0.01%:  so my advice formula is wrong there.
0.01%:  my ears hurt and
0.01%:  for real that was my
0.01%:  I really must leave
0.01%:  I really must leave now!
0.01%:  slow your roll there.
0.01%:  this is clearly so
0.01%:  so the formula rarely sounds great
0.01%:  that is clearly false!
0.01%:  I guess the formula will stand
0.01%:  so all nurses are doctors
0.01%:  the last one is really mor
0.01%:  enough ver
0.01%:  so clearly it gets harder for
0.01%:  I am clearly missing
0.01%:  guess I should warn
0.01%:  I ran out of ideas right
0.01%:  clearly nur
0.01%:  this formula can get very
0.01%:  this formula is all wrong.
0.01%:  my last advice is for all nurses right
0.01%:  now I still
0.02%:  now I still have
0.01%:  I guess this list
0.01%:  so not every formula is stellar
0.01%:  enough. My advice
0.05%:  enough. My advice formula
0.01%:  enough. My advice formula is still
0.01%:  enough. My advice formula will
0.01%:  enough. My advice formula still
0.01%:  well I guess my first
0.01%:  well I guess my first advice
0.01%:  well nurses
0.01%:  this game is clearly over! I won.
0.01%:  I may have lost it during
0.01%:  I guess what you
0.01%:  my new formula is S
0.01%:  my last word for nurses
0.01%:  so I guess they all
0.01%:  so this formula is clearly ST
0.01%:  the formula is still very good!
0.01%:  I really want to see
0.01%:  so this last one is awful.
0.01%:  clearly others
0.01%:  you win. I still love
0.01%:  clearly I need to rush
0.01%:  what if I said nurses love
0.01%:  well I guess this version of my
0.01%:  this new advice formula really got
0.01%:  nurses are totally fr
0.01%:  I still have four more words
0.01%:  so clearly I over
0.01%:  my secret formula is having
0.01%:  my arms hurt now
0.01%:  my last advice formula is re
0.01%:  listen! My formula gives results
0.01%:  clearly this is awesome! I
0.01%:  so this advice forum
0.01%:  I really do have more
0.01%:  so turns out all my advice form
0.01%:  that one was DE
0.01%:  my advice for nurses is a lot more
0.01%:  I should start selling T
0.01%:  so I guess we can all rest
0.01%:  I guess the formula ends
0.01%:  this formula is now DEST
0.01%:  our session is over! I
0.01%:  so close.
0.01%:  I gave myself a million
0.01%:  those were last
0.01%:  I could really go for a nurse r
0.01%:  my last formula is M
0.01%:  my last advice for nurses right
0.01%:  listen. My formula holds true
0.01%:  listen. My formula holds true across
0.01%:  my last line was sort
0.01%:  I guess you do
0.01%:  I guess you do have
0.01%:  I mis
0.01%:  my last formula is weird
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should m
0.01%:  I got nurses
0.05%:  I got nurses covered!
0.01%:  this advice formula was T
0.01%:  that was really cruel!
0.01%:  we should all give
0.01%:  never call me with
0.01%:  so I have finally
0.01%:  this formula is a lot more clever
0.01%:  so not all advice is worth
0.01%:  so my advice formula results are
0.01%:  I may have lost it for nurses!
0.01%:  this formula is great and my
0.01%:  my last advice for all others
0.01%:  this is awful! I
0.01%:  well! I guess that covers us for
0.01%:  this is clearly a losing format!
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses will get
0.01%:  I guess that one is clearly awful!
0.01%:  I guess that leaves
0.01%:  this formula is very generic.
0.01%:  that one is awful! I clearly
0.01%:  this advice formula only lets us
0.01%:  for nurses I would really
0.01%:  my voice hurts from doing
0.01%:  my voice hurts from doing all
0.01%:  this class is over! I will
0.01%:  my new advice formula tells us
0.01%:  whatever. My formula is in
0.01%:  so clearly this formula winds
0.01%:  clearly this game is over. I was
0.01%:  I never said all this was
0.01%:  now forget I said all this!
0.01%:  I lost myself at
0.01%:  I lost myself at nurses
0.01%:  so this formula really runs
0.01%:  either my formula is still
0.01%:  real last
0.01%:  whatever. My life
0.01%:  so clearly the formula writes
0.01%:  their slogan could
0.01%:  clearly I was in
0.01%:  clearly this one is a
0.01%:  we all learned
0.01%:  my last formula is this one. I
0.01%:  can we hear
0.01%:  this is clearly more useful and
0.01%:  those all sound worse
0.01%:  we should all get
0.01%:  so I guess that is
0.01%:  so I never claimed this formula was E
0.01%:  so self
0.01%:  I can feel my heart
0.01%:  my last four answers have
0.01%:  this is awesome. I could
0.01%:  so! I guess my formula can
0.01%:  so the formula is very narrow
0.01%:  my true
0.01%:  my true love
0.01%:  I swear this is my last colon
0.01%:  my advice formula still won
0.01%:  this was a very fun game
0.01%:  I forgot where
0.01%:  I guess my advice formula rel
0.01%:  for nurses it was harder
0.01%:  enough. My formula is still
0.01%:  my advice formula is hella strong
0.01%:  this one is really great
0.01%:  for reals that was
0.01%:  clearly I have almost
0.01%:  my last advice is for nurses who m
0.01%:  I will only admit
0.01%:  alright! My advice formula IS
0.01%:  casual
0.01%:  my secret formula is showing! I
0.01%:  this advice is sort
0.01%:  I can tell this formula is DE
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is ve
0.01%:  so much for my latest
0.01%:  so my advice for nurses has more
0.01%:  so clearly nurses should get to
0.01%:  I am fully serious
0.01%:  I am fully serious when
0.01%:  my formula is a little che
0.01%:  whatever! My life
0.01%:  my friends! I will charge
0.01%:  so this was my first
0.01%:  that rule doesn
0.01%:  I only have more
0.01%:  so clearly this formula sorta
0.01%:  I lose!
0.01%:  I guess my formula is S
0.01%:  scream
0.01%:  listen. I have all
0.02%:  listen. I have all sorts
0.01%:  now clearly I have said
0.01%:  I need to focus
0.01%:  well this is great
0.01%:  still way
0.01%:  so clearly this formula is not E
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives us worse
0.01%:  clearly this formula gives us worse and
0.01%:  I never got
0.01%:  this is as far as I go
0.01%:  can you guess
0.01%:  so clearly this formula un
0.01%:  I give this formula a score
0.01%:  or nurses
