0.07%:  it was in green paint
0.06%:  if I can
0.13%:  if I can't paint

0.06%:  I think most
0.06%:  we're not gonna mention the fact I
0.06%:  that makes no

0.06%:  nothing makes
0.09%:  nothing makes me want
0.06%:  to make
0.08%:  to make things
0.06%:  now I'm taking this conf
0.06%:  that makes me a winner
0.06%:  I can't imagine a worse fate
0.06%:  I think it was meant for
0.06%:  I promise I won't make that a
0.06%:  I'm a man
0.06%:  it was fr
0.06%:  then I ate a
0.06%:  I can see where I
0.06%:  then I went to
0.06%:  no matter how I spin it I'm not

0.06%:  I was meaning to mention it
0.06%:  I'm not gonna make it easier
0.06%:  now I'm certain that if someone
0.06%:  I was a jerk to him
0.06%:  it's gonna take more than ten
0.06%:  it was in front
0.07%:  it was in front of the

0.03%:  I'm not certain that isn
0.03%:  I'm hoping I
0.03%:  we're past the conf
0.03%:  I think it's more of a met
0.03%:  that's it for me. I can
0.03%:  I was j
0.05%:  I was joking the
0.14%:  I was joking the entire
0.10%:  I was joking the entire time.
0.03%:  that makes me want to go

0.10%:  at some point I'm gonna
0.10%:  at some point in
0.05%:  at some point I'm certain
0.04%:  at some point I think I'
0.04%:  at some point I went
0.05%:  at some point I went from
0.03%:  once again I'm the worst
0.03%:  I'm forcing
0.03%:  now I'm seeing the
0.03%:  I can't promise that we
0.03%:  I know I'm gonna paint that
0.03%:  now I'm n
0.13%:  now I'm naming the

0.02%:  I'm not gonna write it
0.02%:  that was me on
0.02%:  after I'
0.02%:  none of that matters in
0.02%:  if we can
0.02%:  that makes me a nin
0.02%:  it's gonna take me another few
0.02%:  I know I'm not 
0.02%:  now I'm making it a secret

0.02%:  I know I can't paint.
0.02%:  we're at an
0.02%:  that is a fact
0.02%:  when it comes to paint I
0.02%:  I think we can agree I'm a
0.02%:  that's gonna wrap
0.02%:  that one was more
0.02%:  I'm now coming to the
0.02%:  if we're gonna name names I think
0.02%:  I know that I'm not gonna
0.02%:  none of that means I can't paint now
0.02%:  I'm not too keen
0.02%:  on that note I am off

0.02%:  once again we see
0.03%:  once again we see that
0.02%:  I swear I'm not gonna make that
0.02%:  I keep that fr
0.02%:  now I'm gonna take that
0.02%:  I think I'm in some
0.02%:  none of that takes
0.02%:  it was taken from the
0.02%:  that reason
0.02%:  I think at some point I came
0.02%:  I think it was after I'
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for the
0.02%:  that means I'm wrong
0.02%:  I think after I
0.02%:  we can see that
0.02%:  then it got
0.02%:  it's not an ap
0.02%:  after this I'm not
0.02%:  I forgot his weapon
0.02%:  I want some of
0.02%:  that one came from
0.02%:  that one's canon.
0.02%:  each

0.10%:  each time I mention
0.04%:  each time I paint
0.03%:  each time I mention it
0.02%:  I promise not to take
0.02%:  I'm not certain if I meant it as a joke.
0.02%:  I'm aware that it makes
0.02%:  I want that on
0.02%:  I'm gonna take this paint
0.02%:  now I'm naming the paint
0.02%:  I won't mention his name to

0.02%:  I know I'm the first to
0.06%:  I know I'm the first to mention
0.02%:  I think we can forget I
0.02%:  now I'm fine
0.02%:  that one time I wrote fan
0.02%:  I think if I were to paint again someone
0.02%:  I'm making the entire scene
0.02%:  I think it's time for me to nap.
0.02%:  neither can
0.02%:  he's wearing a jet
0.07%:  he's wearing a jet pack
0.02%:  that one's gonna come
0.02%:  the reason I came into
0.02%:  he was not in
0.02%:  that's not one
0.02%:  that time I'm not
0.02%:  I hope I'm not making it worse
0.02%:  none of that was conf
0.02%:  I was keeping that from
0.02%:  I know that if I paint
0.06%:  I know that if I paint again
0.02%:  I spent an entire month making it
0.02%:  that it'
0.02%:  I'm mention
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint at
0.02%:  I can't promise when
0.02%:  I think it's time to re
0.02%:  I can't promise what
0.02%:  I'm the painter
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret in
0.02%:  that was a joke for
0.02%:  I think I can't promise
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint a new one after this.

0.02%:  I think I'm a great
0.02%:  I'm certain that I knew
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that into
0.02%:  I think one reason
0.02%:  coming to
0.02%:  for a
0.08%:  for a moment
0.03%:  for a moment I was
0.02%:  when I paint again it's not
0.02%:  I can't imagine a point
0.08%:  I can't imagine a point where
0.02%:  we're on the same
0.02%:  actions
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna write a note
0.02%:  I can't stop the
0.02%:  I'm gonna make it a
0.11%:  I'm gonna make it a secret
0.07%:  I'm gonna make it a secret now
0.02%:  that means I'm in a
0.02%:  I was the one making it
0.02%:  now I'm speaking too
0.02%:  none of this came from
0.02%:  speaking of ninja action
0.02%:  once again I'm the reason we

0.02%:  we can't mention that in
0.02%:  none of them
0.04%:  none of them were
0.02%:  I'm at the age
0.02%:  I'm not a painter. I think
0.02%:  we're gonna keep it at that.
0.02%:  I was a jerk then
0.02%:  I'm wearing his face

0.02%:  from that point on it
0.02%:  I know it isn

0.02%:  that's not an image I can
0.02%:  I'm not gonna mention it was a
0.02%:  a few months after
0.02%:  the reason I want to keep
0.02%:  I promise I won't make conf
0.02%:  it's that
0.03%:  it's that conf
0.02%:  it's gonna take more than ancient

0.02%:  we're making the
0.02%:  I want to stop
0.02%:  I think I ate paint
0.02%:  it's now time
0.02%:  I'm coming off as a jerk
0.02%:  at this moment in

0.02%:  part of that
0.02%:  that meant
0.02%:  I paint from

0.02%:  then I was making
0.02%:  if it'
0.02%:  I think I want to paint some more in

0.02%:  I think it's gonna remain a conf
0.02%:  I can't swear I
0.02%:  I think I'm was
0.02%:  now I'm gonna paint the entire
0.02%:  at this point we can agree I
0.02%:  at this point we can agree I'm not
0.02%:  I know it matters
0.02%:  I can't forget to mention his
0.02%:  that isn't making
0.02%:  I think I'm wearing someone
0.02%:  I'm nothing if not frank
0.02%:  then I took
0.02%:  now I'm not so certain the
0.02%:  we're not gonna paint
0.02%:  I was joking.
0.02%:  part of that conf
0.02%:  part of me wants to make
0.02%:  I'm not a fan of keeping
0.02%:  I think if we're gonna paint
0.02%:  I'm not fifteen

0.02%:  the main reason I'm not an
0.02%:  I think I wanna get some
0.04%:  I think I wanna get some paint
0.02%:  I spent more time on that
0.02%:  now I'm thank

0.02%:  on a
0.02%:  now I'm speaking in fiction
0.02%:  I'm certain none of that was an
0.02%:  some part
0.02%:  I know that since I'm not
0.02%:  we're taking that one
0.02%:  I think we're seeing
0.02%:  we're not keeping that conf
0.02%:  I can't imagine what I meant in
0.02%:  now it's time for nap
0.02%:  none of that means I'm wrong in
0.02%:  that makes two confirm
0.02%:  I won't paint again for ten
0.02%:  I think I am now certain
0.02%:  I'm so certain I
0.02%:  I forgot his name. I
0.02%:  it was the ninja one

0.02%:  at this point we're gonna
0.02%:  I am aware of the fact
0.02%:  I'm not certain if it was one of the main
0.02%:  I won't take that
0.02%:  I know it's canon that
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint worse
0.02%:  I think it's time for me to face an
0.02%:  I promise I'm not j

0.02%:  that was me confirm
0.02%:  I can't imagine who I
0.02%:  I know it's not a great an
0.02%:  now I can't imagine him
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep those
0.02%:  we're gonna skip the
0.02%:  I am not 
0.02%:  it was me on
0.02%:  I'm not certain the point
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint som
0.02%:  I'm not gonna promise that it
0.02%:  the reason I went on
0.02%:  I forgot the paint was
0.02%:  I'm not certain that if someone
0.02%:  I'm awake
0.02%:  I'm awake right
0.02%:  he's got
0.02%:  I am not a painter now
0.02%:  I think I'm facing a
0.02%:  I meant to paint it when

0.02%:  now I cannot
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna frame it so
0.02%:  that's one giant
0.03%:  that's one giant conf
0.02%:  we can ignore the
0.02%:  it was in the form of an
0.02%:  now I'm off to change
0.02%:  that's on camera
0.02%:  I'm not waiting for him
0.02%:  I'm sort of fine

0.02%:  it's gonna take more time
0.25%:  it's gonna take more time than I can
0.02%:  I was hoping none
0.02%:  part of me thinks I can
0.03%:  part of me thinks I can't imagine
0.02%:  I know it's not fair to name
0.02%:  I know none of that means I'm a
0.02%:  I think I meant to compare
0.02%:  I'm speaking of him
0.02%:  that's making me wanna
0.02%:  at some point in there
0.02%:  if we're gonna make
0.02%:  if we're gonna make this
0.02%:  I know for a fact I meant it in

0.03%:  ninjas are
0.02%:  I promise I won't mention it if he
0.02%:  since I'm a grown
0.02%:  the main point remains
0.02%:  it was the 
0.02%:  I think we're in a
0.02%:  I know that isn't canon
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that again
0.02%:  now I'm certain things
0.02%:  it was on the front of an ice
0.02%:  now I can't shake
0.02%:  that means I'm now 
0.02%:  that was gonna
0.02%:  I can promise I won't make the
0.02%:  I'm now making the
0.02%:  since I'm on a
0.02%:  that's me wanting
0.02%:  in that one
0.02%:  in that one moment
0.02%:  I once wrote a fan

0.02%:  I was meaning to mention that if
0.02%:  it took me 
0.02%:  now that I mention it I see
0.02%:  I think it's gone now
0.02%:  I promise I won't think
0.02%:  if I'm wrong then it
0.02%:  I imagine that I
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint now
0.02%:  I think I want to go to
0.02%:  now I can neither
0.02%:  one time I threw a paint

0.02%:  if I was making that conf
0.01%:  that's a warning
0.01%:  I think I'm certain of it now
0.01%:  I think if I go
0.01%:  I was ten for a
0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing this
0.01%:  that means I'm in for
0.01%:  none of that means I can't paint if
0.01%:  I saw him
0.01%:  there I am making
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a con
0.01%:  now I'm naming parts

0.01%:  if I was gonna paint a
0.01%:  it was ninja paint
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep this fact
0.01%:  at some point when

0.01%:  that one's for
0.01%:  that one's coming from an
0.01%:  I am now certain he
0.01%:  after we
0.01%:  I'm not certain what I imagine
0.01%:  I promise I won't fake
0.01%:  there was a ninja on top
0.01%:  it was after I got
0.01%:  since then I'm
0.01%:  I know there's no point at
0.01%:  once again it's time for me to paint
0.01%:  I know I'm that
0.01%:  that's not gonna make it
0.01%:  now I can't stop the
0.01%:  that one came from a

0.01%:  I'm gonna take this from
0.01%:  in some
0.01%:  now I'm speaking in mon
0.01%:  I know that's not a crime in
0.01%:  I'm sort of a
0.01%:  that was one giant
0.01%:  then one
0.03%:  then one time I was
0.01%:  I think I'm writing too

0.01%:  now I'm facing the first
0.01%:  I know I might
0.01%:  we're gonna keep this a
0.01%:  I'm not smart
0.01%:  to make it worse I
0.01%:  that's fine. I
0.01%:  that means I win for
0.01%:  am I the
0.01%:  I can't paint so
0.01%:  two

0.01%:  I'm not racing to paint
0.01%:  I wanna paint more times
0.01%:  I think I'm coming into a
0.01%:  I mean that one

0.01%:  on that note it
0.01%:  now I see the

0.01%:  I mean the cartoon one. I mean
0.01%:  the frame

0.01%:  if I was gonna paint another
0.01%:  when I paint in
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a few conf
0.01%:  I know I spent more than a

0.01%:  it was on a gre
0.01%:  I mean it in the sinc
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint another time

0.01%:  I was gonna keep that one from
0.01%:  I can't imagine a worse met
0.01%:  if we're keeping it honest
0.01%:  I think at some point it
0.01%:  I keep meaning to re

0.01%:  I know that came
0.01%:  I think I'm time
0.01%:  no I won
0.01%:  no I won't confirm
0.01%:  now I'm hoping I can

0.01%:  I'm not a painter of things
0.01%:  the time I
0.01%:  the time I spent
0.01%:  the time I spent writing
0.01%:  I think if I can't get
0.01%:  I took the paint
0.01%:  I know it from
0.01%:  at the risk of coming
0.01%:  now I think it's too
0.01%:  I think we can agree on one point at
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention if I was the
0.01%:  I can't imagine a paint
0.01%:  I'm not so certain if
0.01%:  we're keeping that in
0.01%:  from now on I'm keeping that fact in

0.01%:  to make things we
0.01%:  I knew it then
0.01%:  at that point we'
0.01%:  I'm certain I now
0.01%:  I am most certain he

0.01%:  I now think
0.01%:  then I was a painter
0.01%:  that time we
0.01%:  on that note I'm opening a new art
0.01%:  I know that a painter
0.01%:  I can name the
0.01%:  now I'm open
0.01%:  that one's from a
0.01%:  I can't imagine how far
0.01%:  I'm the one wearing a
0.01%:  I meant a
0.01%:  it was him
0.01%:  I am the first
0.01%:  I promise I won't make it a conf
0.01%:  I know that if someone can
0.03%:  I know that if someone can paint
0.01%:  that's for me
0.01%:  now I'm making the entire point
0.01%:  I'm certain I know it
0.01%:  now that I come
0.01%:  I think we can agree it's no
0.01%:  I won't mention that in
0.01%:  I'm making one
0.01%:  now I'm gonna make another
0.01%:  none of that was a joke in
0.01%:  I mean to paint again when
0.01%:  now it's time for me to face the pain
0.01%:  that marks
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna write a one
0.01%:  I am now at peace.
0.01%:  I'm now not
0.01%:  I'm now not certain
0.01%:  now the paint's on
0.01%:  I'm gonna remain
0.01%:  that's coming off
0.01%:  I keep meaning to mention I
0.01%:  I'm keeping that as an
0.01%:  I was eating a pe
0.01%:  I think it was in green
0.01%:  now it's one
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint it the
0.01%:  we're picking this
0.01%:  I know I'm not meeting
0.01%:  in a moment of intense
0.01%:  that was part
0.01%:  we're not taking this one
0.01%:  we're on again
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of them
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of him
0.01%:  on that note I'm gonna re
0.01%:  one more thing I wanna mention
0.01%:  it was a thank
0.01%:  I can see it in front
0.03%:  I can see it in front of me now
0.01%:  I can see it in front of me.
0.01%:  I can see it in front of me now.
0.01%:  now I'm off to paint him again.
0.01%:  now I'm making it the
0.01%:  now I'm certain that keeping
0.01%:  I'm now speaking from
0.01%:  I am at
0.01%:  I am at peace knowing
0.01%:  now I'm an honest painter again
0.01%:  I think it went for
0.01%:  I'm not certain when I paint
0.02%:  I'm not certain when I paint again
0.01%:  if we can'
0.02%:  if we can't agree
0.04%:  if we can't agree on that
0.01%:  if we can't agree that
0.01%:  if we can't agree on the
0.01%:  now I'm making the rest of it
0.01%:  once again I think it's time for a new name
0.01%:  now I sorta
0.01%:  we're not gonna mention his name.
0.01%:  I think it's time for tea
0.01%:  at this point I can't make
0.01%:  no I'm not certain that I
0.01%:  I'm gonna open that
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a w
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint that.
0.01%:  I'm poor
0.01%:  that fact is
0.01%:  none of these paint
0.01%:  I'm certain nothing makes
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint soon
0.01%:  now I'm eating the paint from
0.01%:  I'm certain that none of it means
0.01%:  I was in a room
0.01%:  that makes it more
0.01%:  I know none of it is
0.01%:  I can't mention him
0.01%:  now I'm certain someone in
0.01%:  I meant to phrase
0.01%:  I forgot I meant
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that secret on
0.01%:  we agree
0.01%:  I was the age I
0.01%:  I can't think of a worse ep
0.01%:  now it's a perfect
0.01%:  it's gonna take me fifteen
0.01%:  that's gonna make for one
0.01%:  it's not that I can
0.01%:  I can't seem to imagine how
0.01%:  it was fine
0.01%:  that one's not fair
0.01%:  at the rate
0.01%:  if I were to paint him again I'm not
0.01%:  I want to see if I can get a
0.01%:  I want to remain a
0.01%:  that was an epic
0.01%:  I can see what I meant
0.01%:  I was in the market
0.01%:  now speaking
0.01%:  that's off
0.01%:  I'm certain that on
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna write some paint
0.01%:  there is a conf
0.01%:  he's on a
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint more now.
0.01%:  I was gonna name it after
0.01%:  on that note I want

0.01%:  not that it
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat the
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat the paint
0.01%:  for that I'm not
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than wine
0.01%:  from now on I'm taking the
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna frame it to
0.01%:  I mean that in an awesome
0.01%:  I'm not certain I want a
0.01%:  now I can't imagine it
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a scene

0.02%:  I'm gonna paint a scene where
0.01%:  right now I'm in
0.01%:  that we're speaking in
0.01%:  it's gonna take me two
0.01%:  I'm certain I paint
0.01%:  I can't imagine if someone
0.01%:  I can imagine no worse fate than if
0.01%:  I meant to ask him
0.01%:  I'm not forget
0.01%:  I can not promise
0.01%:  now it makes me
0.01%:  I can't point

0.01%:  I'm working in the
0.01%:  I'm working in the past
0.01%:  I can keep
0.01%:  I think I see a
0.01%:  it's not a perfect
0.01%:  I think I'm waiting on
0.01%:  I think it's now time to face

0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that secret if I
0.01%:  the front
0.01%:  in that same conf
0.01%:  now there's no point in me taking
0.01%:  I'm aware nothing
0.01%:  one time I was in

0.01%:  I can see the paint on
0.01%:  I'm now certain I am
0.01%:  I'm know
0.01%:  I know that's proof
0.01%:  I want this off
0.01%:  if we can't agree on that point
0.01%:  to the
0.01%:  I'm now certain that in
0.01%:  as the
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna ret
0.01%:  that's known
0.01%:  that means I won't get
0.01%:  now it makes more
0.01%:  I was eating a cookie
0.01%:  I'm gonna print that one
0.01%:  the reason I kept it
0.01%:  I am not a painter of
0.01%:  at this point we are

0.01%:  then I went into art
0.01%:  now I am certain I'm the
0.01%:  I know I'm facing the
0.01%:  now that it's in
0.01%:  I promise I won't mention again that in
0.01%:  he's a woman
0.01%:  that means we're coming to
0.01%:  I think I'm sorta coming
0.01%:  if it were a
0.01%:  I'm not the sort
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention that if I were
0.01%:  there was a can of paint on
0.01%:  I'm gonna write a note
0.01%:  I'm not making that into
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop at

0.01%:  now I'm off to see
0.01%:  the camera
0.01%:  I'm not taking paint
0.01%:  I can't wait to take
0.01%:  the main reason I can't get

0.01%:  I know that's a giant
0.01%:  I'm now facing the same
0.01%:  now I'm certain again that
0.01%:  since we're not gonna
0.01%:  since we're not gonna mention
0.01%:  since we're not gonna paint
0.01%:  I'm gonna take that opinion
0.01%:  I think it's gonna come off
0.01%:  I'm here to
0.01%:  I think it was after I got
0.01%:  I'm not joking. I
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna stop at
0.01%:  I'm working at
0.01%:  I think someone at
0.01%:  that's it for me knowing
0.01%:  what I mean
0.01%:  none of that means I can't imagine new
0.01%:  it was not meant for
0.01%:  I know I'm one of the first
0.01%:  I'm certain that it was one
0.01%:  I'm most certain nothing
0.01%:  I wrote fan fiction to
0.02%:  I wrote fan fiction to make
0.01%:  I meant to paint in
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret to
0.01%:  I think from now on I can
0.01%:  I think I was aiming more
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint to
0.01%:  I spent a week on it.
0.01%:  now I'm certain that if I paint
0.01%:  I'm making it easier
0.01%:  there's paint
0.01%:  I'm aware that not
0.01%:  I want to hear no
0.01%:  on that note I can't imagine a worse
0.01%:  that one's more
0.01%:  now it's more than
0.01%:  I want that taken
0.01%:  now I'm p
0.02%:  now I'm patting
0.01%:  pre

0.01%:  I meant to paint them
0.01%:  I meant to paint them wearing
0.01%:  that was a 
0.01%:  I'm not certain I saw
0.01%:  I think I'm certain none
0.01%:  that means I'm writing a
0.01%:  I was keeping that in
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention if he
0.01%:  no I'm not certain it was the
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint on the
0.01%:  I forgot what it means
0.01%:  I'm not certain that one is a
0.01%:  I'm not certain it was the one in
0.01%:  I am not certain that I'
0.01%:  now I'm certain of these
0.01%:  I think I'm in tears now
0.01%:  I'm not too certain he
0.01%:  there's no point in making a nin
0.01%:  I sort of want to keep
0.01%:  I'm writing these
0.01%:  I'm writing these conf

0.01%:  I sent it to him
0.01%:  we can see right
0.01%:  it was crap
0.01%:  that means we're on topic
0.01%:  it took me three
0.01%:  I can now imagine
0.01%:  I'm not certain it was an image
0.01%:  if he'
0.01%:  he was making it
0.01%:  he was making it rain
0.01%:  now I'm certain no one has
0.01%:  I think it comes from a

0.01%:  the reason I'm making a point
0.01%:  I know that I'm not gonna paint

0.01%:  I can see I'm not gonna
0.01%:  I can see I'm not gonna make
0.01%:  now I'm keeping it that
0.01%:  then we're gonna
0.01%:  it was on that one page
0.01%:  I'm most certain that I won
0.01%:  I think it's time for a nap too

0.03%:  if I was to paint again
0.01%:  if I was to paint again I
0.01%:  I'm awesome at it
0.01%:  I'm not certain of the tim
0.01%:  I know for a fact I sp
0.01%:  on that note I imagine
0.01%:  I'm gonna start the
0.01%:  I can't paint things
0.01%:  I'm not gonna win a
0.01%:  that one isn't coming from
0.01%:  it's for

0.01%:  I hope I'm forg
0.01%:  I'm not as certain now
0.01%:  that one time a
0.01%:  I'm gonna make a point of that in

0.01%:  if I were facing
0.01%:  we're a team
0.01%:  we're a team again

0.01%:  I fear it
0.01%:  from this point on I can'
0.03%:  from this point on I can't imagine

0.01%:  that's it for keeping
0.01%:  it's more than 
0.01%:  I am not certain he was
0.01%:  since I know I'm the

0.01%:  at no point in time
0.01%:  now I'm the first to
0.01%:  now I'm staring at him
0.01%:  after nin
0.01%:  it's what
0.01%:  it's what I imagine
0.01%:  I spent an entire night on
0.01%:  I'm not certain it won

0.01%:  I think it is now time for me to face
0.01%:  I think if I were to come
0.01%:  now I'm certain to
0.01%:  make that
0.01%:  the reason I'm gonna keep
0.01%:  in the time
0.02%:  in the time since
0.01%:  I can't imagine it was a
0.01%:  that came from a

0.01%:  he was part of a team
0.01%:  that was a great conf
0.01%:  I'm certain I am speaking in
0.01%:  I'm certain I am speaking in the
0.01%:  here I am again not
0.01%:  I want to frame it
0.01%:  on that note I'm keeping
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep on with
0.01%:  I'm not certain when I stop making
0.01%:  if I was gonna mention
0.01%:  at this point I'm working on
0.01%:  I can't imagine one person who
0.01%:  I kept the name
0.01%:  I forgot I conf
0.01%:  I think it went on to inspire a
0.01%:  I want him to get
0.01%:  I think if we compare
0.01%:  since I'm a man of few
0.01%:  now it's time for me to keep
0.01%:  no I'm not gonna make it
0.01%:  I'm certain it was him
0.01%:  I'm not gonna paint that one
0.01%:  I'm a racist now
0.01%:  I think I wanna go paint it
0.01%:  now I'm certain I am not a
0.01%:  I was one of the mean
0.01%:  I'm writing in the past

0.02%:  I'm aware of none of these
0.01%:  I'm aware of none of that
0.03%:  I'm aware of none of that making
0.01%:  I was hoping if
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna swear off pain
0.01%:  I can name them in
0.01%:  it's coming apart now
0.01%:  I was making that name
0.01%:  here I'm making it
0.01%:  I knew that coming into it.
0.01%:  I think I can't paint again
0.01%:  I'm not raising
0.01%:  I can't think of a great
0.01%:  we're not gonna mention him in
0.01%:  I know ninjas are not
0.01%:  I know that's pat
0.01%:  this comment
0.01%:  I'm not gonna stick with

0.01%:  that's now making
0.01%:  at this point I am making
0.01%:  I'm certain of that opinion
0.01%:  I can't paint it again for
0.01%:  I think we can agree I'm not as
0.01%:  we're making this into

0.01%:  that skin
0.01%:  I think I want some more f

0.01%:  I think I'm gonna enter
0.01%:  now I'm certain I meant to paint a
0.01%:  now I'm naming cities
0.01%:  now I'm naming cities after the
0.01%:  since I'm not a painter I know that
0.01%:  in a few months I'm gonna paint it
0.01%:  I can make the

0.01%:  at one point I think I wrote
0.01%:  once again I want
0.01%:  once again I want to thank
0.01%:  I make no promise that I won't again
0.01%:  I'm asking a
0.01%:  I want another ice
0.01%:  I am certain these
0.01%:  we can agree that in
0.01%:  I knew the secret
0.01%:  that was a joke. I'
0.01%:  that was meant in
0.01%:  I'm not certain I know if this
0.01%:  I can't imagine what in
0.01%:  I'm now speaking met
0.01%:  I sorta wanna

0.01%:  I'm certain the point I
0.01%:  I'm certain the point I was making in
0.01%:  those are not
0.01%:  I am now speaking to
0.01%:  we're coming to an
0.01%:  I think I'm eating some
0.01%:  I wrote it in the
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint the same one now
0.01%:  I am aware of this
0.01%:  I'm certain none of it was in
0.01%:  I'm not a painter so I think
0.01%:  I know that I promise
0.01%:  the ninja part's not
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna spare
0.01%:  I am now comfort

0.01%:  I swear I'm gonna keep
0.01%:  I swear I'm gonna keep that
0.01%:  now I'm sitting at a
0.01%:  that's me I
0.01%:  I'm certain I was making the point
0.01%:  since I'm not a painter then
0.01%:  I know the camera
0.01%:  I was taking pain
0.01%:  I promise I won't get into the
0.01%:  now I think I'm gonna paint a nice
0.01%:  I'm certain none of that is at
0.01%:  I know it's a matter
0.01%:  I can't think of a more po
0.01%:  I wrote a fan fiction in the
0.01%:  I know I'm not gonna paint in
0.01%:  I'm not gonna take that one
0.01%:  it's making me want to paint for
0.01%:  I am not certain how to
0.01%:  I'm certain it was not the one
0.01%:  I meant to write none
0.01%:  there was no face
0.01%:  that was after taking
0.01%:  on that note I'm gonna write a fan
0.01%:  I know I'm not hitting
0.01%:  I can't manage
0.01%:  I was more into it
0.01%:  I was more into it than I'
0.01%:  I think I in
0.01%:  I promise I won't mention acting
0.01%: . I was
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint more cats
0.01%:  one time I went into
0.01%:  I'm aware this joke
0.01%:  when it comes to making paint
0.01%:  I mean the cartoon. I
0.01%:  I mean the cartoon. I mean
0.01%:  it was in traffic
0.01%:  no matter how I paint it I
0.01%:  no matter how I paint it I can
0.01%:  it's gonna take more paint than we
0.01%:  I'm not picking on
0.01%:  now I'm gonna stop.
0.01%:  again that
0.01%:  I'm not certain that makes a
0.01%:  I think I ate most
0.01%:  I got a few
0.01%:  I keep that secret now
0.01%:  I keep that a secret in
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint a new one so

0.01%:  I know for a fact that I'm opening
0.01%:  we're gonna stop on
0.01%:  now I'm not an artist at
0.01%:  now I'm certain some
0.01%:  there's no point wanting
0.01%:  in fact that
0.01%:  if we can agree on that point
0.01%:  I'm not gonna act
0.01%:  I think I wanna paint one more time to
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I want those
0.01%:  the reason I know I can't paint at
0.01%:  there was a ninja cat in it
0.01%:  I can't see where it

0.01%:  I think I'm in more
0.01%:  there was a ninja.
0.01%:  I'm not working that in

0.01%:  a few other conf
0.01%:  I threw it against

0.01%:  for the past ten
0.01%:  that's a one

0.01%:  more than a few of
0.01%:  that means I'm ancient
0.01%:  that's coming from an anti
0.01%:  I'm making this into a conf
0.01%:  from that point in time on

0.01%:  more than a few times
0.01%:  I can't paint either one again
0.01%:  I went too far in that conf
0.01%:  I know he's not facing
0.01%:  none of this came from a
0.01%:  can we agree that if
0.01%:  too
0.01%:  now I think it's gone

0.01%:  I forgot to paint its
0.01%:  I forgot to paint its face
0.01%:  it was magic

0.01%:  then I was fifteen.
0.01%:  I can't stop making new
0.01%:  there I am coming
0.01%:  I'm certain of it too

0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing that it
0.01%:  it was on a cheap

0.01%:  I think I'm on to a
0.01%:  I think I'm on to a new project
0.01%:  I think I'm on to a new front
0.01%:  time for me to face

0.01%:  I meant to paint it in green
0.01%:  seeing how
0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing that.
0.01%:  I think now is a great

0.01%:  I know it's more of an
0.01%:  I promise I'm not a nin
0.01%:  I know I'm off topic.
0.01%:  I forgot the ninja weapons in
0.01%:  that I'm speaking of
0.01%:  none of it is making me want
0.01%:  I spent time working
0.01%:  I spent time working on that

0.01%:  I think I wrote an
0.01%:  I think it's time for a new ep
0.01%:  I'm most certain I want to keep
0.01%:  when I paint I imagine someone
0.01%:  I'm not asking for him
0.01%:  I'm certain the same
0.01%:  I think I was in art
0.01%:  I keep this fact
0.01%:  that one time I conf
0.01%:  I was gonna make it into an
0.01%:  I can't forget to mention he was pink.
0.01%:  that was me from
0.01%:  I'm certain that not knowing if

0.01%:  I'm not owning it either
0.01%:  I'm one giant
0.01%:  that's gonna wreck

0.01%:  I forgot to paint the ninja face
0.01%:  now I'm certain that if I paint someone
0.01%:  it was a tree
0.01%:  that means I make
0.01%:  now it's time for action
0.01%:  we can agree on the
0.01%:  I can't get either
0.01%:  I'm certain that knowing none
0.01%:  that we're not speaking
0.01%:  I think I'm staring into an
0.01%:  each time I mention it I'
0.01%:  what's not
0.01%:  I'm certain no one wants to paint him
0.01%:  I can't make it worse than

0.01%:  scrap
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint it so
0.01%:  I was in charge of n
0.01%:  now I'm not so certain if that
0.01%:  I think I came on
0.01%:  I might want to paint one

0.01%:  it was the fr

0.01%:  if I'm not certain I
0.01%:  it's the ninja one.
0.01%:  I think if I were to go paint

0.01%:  that makes me want to join
0.01%:  as a painter I'm not

0.01%:  I forgot paint is
0.01%:  it's gonna take a moment
0.01%:  I'm not certain if it was of the
0.01%:  to think I was gonna paint a
0.01%:  I meant I was fifteen the
0.01%:  if we can't agree on this
0.01%:  now I can't think of one
0.01%:  I think it's great to
0.01%:  I think at one point it
0.01%:  I know that means I can't go
0.01%:  I know I'm certain someone
0.01%:  that's not a joke I
0.01%:  I chose not
0.01%:  I chose not to paint
0.01%:  I think I paint now
0.01%:  then I won'
0.01%:  then I won't paint
0.10%:  then I won't paint again for
0.01%:  then I won't paint again for a
0.01%:  then I won't paint again.
0.01%:  then I won't paint again for ten
0.01%:  I'm not certain someone with

0.01%:  I'm sorta gonna
0.01%:  we're not gonna make a
0.01%:  now I'm making it so that none
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna start on
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna start on a new piece
0.01%:  I con
0.01%:  the reason I'm not eating paint
0.01%:  I'm not making that face on
0.01%:  that means I'm certain now
0.01%:  it's him again.
0.01%:  I make no secret of that
0.01%:  now I am certain of those
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention what paint
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that great of
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that great of an
0.01%:  I won't repeat that.
0.01%:  I think I'm an awesome painter if it
0.01%:  now I'm speaking of the cart
0.01%:  now the joke's on
0.01%:  I'm working that one
0.01%:  most of the time I paint
0.01%:  I know for a fact it's the one in
0.01%:  I'm wearing his face paint
0.01%:  then I wrote fan fiction on
0.01%:  now I think I'm insane
0.01%:  I think one reason I want
0.01%:  I think if I went into
0.01%:  that is me in
0.01%:  I think I'm eating it
0.01%:  I think I'm eating it now
0.01%:  I think if I can paint someone
0.01%:  if I'm not that
0.01%:  I can't imagine a painter of
0.01%:  I'm gonna write that scene in
0.01%:  I am now speaking met
0.01%:  now's the perfect
0.01%:  that's a non
0.01%:  there it is again. I cannot
0.01%:  we're opening a
0.01%:  we're opening a can
0.01%:  I meant it to come
0.01%:  I see no point in making that fact
0.01%:  the green
0.01%:  the green one was
0.01%:  I think I'm ne
0.01%:  I know one person
0.01%:  I'm not gonna fake
0.01%:  I'm not taking these conf
0.01%:  I meant to paint him facing front
0.01%:  I'm the first one on
0.01%:  I swear I'm not joking at
0.01%:  that's not pain
0.01%:  none of that was coming
0.01%:  the main reason I came into
0.01%:  I know I'm gonna paint it some
0.01%:  I know it's not fiction
0.01%:  I want to take a moment here
0.01%:  I got that paint from
0.01%:  coming into
0.01%:  that one makes perfect
0.01%:  that works in
0.01%:  I am now in tears of
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I was making the point
0.01%:  I know the secret name
0.01%:  can'
0.01%:  can't imagine
0.01%:  can't promise
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop now. I
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop now. I think
0.01%:  I'm not certain I got his
0.01%:  I'm not certain I got his name
0.01%:  I'm not making the point
0.01%:  I can paint it again now
0.01%:  now it's time for the main
0.01%:  I think it was a t
0.01%:  I know more than I can
0.01%:  I know I'm not gonna paint it either
0.01%:  the perfect
0.01%:  it was the opening
0.01%:  now I can't think of it
0.01%:  that time I'm gonna
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I mean it as a joke
0.01%:  I'm certain that if I go
0.01%:  if we can agree that'
0.01%:  I'm not certain if pain
0.01%:  I wish none
0.01%:  when I paint on
0.01%:  I think from now on I am
0.01%:  I can't imagine a more poet
0.01%:  the main reason I'm 
0.01%:  I want to see him paint again
0.01%:  I was meaning to mention there
0.01%:  none of that makes me a painter
0.01%:  the awesome
0.01%:  I know I spent an
0.02%:  I know I spent an entire
0.01%:  I know I spent an entire night
0.01%:  for the past nine

0.01%:  the reason I can make
0.01%:  that one's gonna keep
0.01%:  now I can't imagine either
0.01%:  if I'm gonna make conf
0.01%:  since I'm not a time
0.01%:  I know that's not an ego trip
0.01%:  I'm not certain if the image
0.01%:  I know it changes
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint me
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint me another
0.01%:  I'm gonna reach
0.01%:  I think it's time for a new canon
0.01%:  I'm certain the one
0.01%:  I know that name means
0.01%:  it was the one time I'
0.01%:  that means I'm certain it
0.01%:  when I paint again in
0.01%:  if I paint that
0.01%:  if I paint that again
0.01%:  I think I'm not gonna paint since
0.01%:  now there's an image of

0.01%:  I'm gonna frame this in
0.01%:  I can't imagine the answer
0.01%:  that is fine
0.01%:  now the entire point
0.01%:  I think someone can paint a
0.01%:  I was a time
0.01%:  I think if I start
0.01%:  I know that's an entire conf
0.01%:  I'm certain that in a

0.01%:  I'm writing them
0.01%:  now I imagine that'
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna water
0.01%:  I'm writing a one
0.01%:  we can see that I
0.01%:  no matter what I can
0.01%:  no matter what I can't imagine
0.01%:  no matter what I can't seem
0.01%:  each time I mention it I want
0.01%:  I was certain of it
0.01%:  I can't imagine that it
0.01%:  the reason I know I can't paint it
0.01%:  I know that if it
0.01%:  I'm gonna step on a

0.01%:  that '
0.01%:  if I were a paint
0.01%:  I can promise that I won't mention again
0.01%:  a horse.
0.01%:  I'm working on those
0.01%:  when I paint I often imagine someone
0.01%:  I can't forget to mention him
0.01%:  I want to get it
0.01%:  if that makes me a nin
0.01%:  it was in an orange
0.01%:  I'm gonna ask for a
0.01%:  at this moment I know
0.01%:  I think I gotta paint more if
0.01%:  we're not gonna make it in
0.01%:  we're not gonna make it in the
0.01%:  that one was fifteen
0.01%:  I'm not a patient

0.01%:  if I can't keep this
0.01%:  if I'm not making that conf
0.01%:  I think I once wrote a fan
0.01%:  there was a ninja cop
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention the rest
0.01%:  I'm gonna ask him to paint for
0.01%:  I think I wanna paint more of
0.01%:  it's not for
0.01%:  I know it's a ninja thing
0.01%:  I am most certain we
0.01%:  we're past fifteen
0.01%:  if I'm the
0.01%:  it makes me wanna go
0.01%:  I won't paint again in case the
0.01%:  repeat
0.01%:  I meant to pick
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna want to remain
0.01%:  I am making conf
0.01%:  I'm now making the case
0.01%:  I'm making this part of

0.01%:  now I'm racist
0.01%:  now I got tears
0.01%:  it was after the one
0.01%:  I'm gonna step on it now
0.01%:  once again I was
0.01%:  I think if I promise not
0.01%:  I'm now certain that speaking in
0.01%:  it was more than one time
0.01%:  that was one entire
0.01%:  that was one entire conf
0.01%:  I swear I'm keeping
0.01%:  I swear I'm keeping that
0.01%:  once again I ask
0.01%:  I think it's nice of
0.01%:  he was ninja too
0.01%:  no matter how I spin it none
0.01%:  I think it's time for ap
0.01%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint another time
0.01%:  I knew that meant it
0.01%:  now I'm taking another
0.01%:  I know that no painter since
0.01%:  I think if I'm gonna start
0.01%:  I can't imagine a point where it
0.01%:  that means I can't imagine I
0.01%:  I know for a fact I meant it in a
0.01%:  now I'm shaking in fear of

0.01%:  that's in front
0.01%:  that's in front of me
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention this fact

0.01%:  after I paint I eat
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna warn
0.01%:  I think I want to eat some ice
0.01%:  I am aware that if

0.01%:  I'm not gonna tear
0.01%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint him now.
0.01%:  it was at a camp
0.01%:  there's no point in making a met
0.01%:  I keep that image in front
0.01%:  I think it's a great name
0.01%:  I am not certain when I'
0.01%:  that one fact is
0.01%:  I think part of me is a
0.01%:  I was ten again at

0.00%:  I'm not in a great
0.00%:  I think it's eating
0.00%:  we're speaking in a
0.00%:  since I'm not gonna paint it
0.00%:  there's no point in making me wait
0.00%:  I promise I won't name that one

0.00%:  I'm aware this an
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than one ice
0.00%:  now I'm making another one
0.00%:  I'm certain the joke is

0.00%:  I'm not certain if making this
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a few times after
0.00%:  I'm certain that I know some
0.00%:  there's no point making it a
0.00%:  if that isn't e
0.00%:  I think I can paint some more
0.00%:  I mean it in the generic
0.00%:  there's a tape of me making

0.00%:  I know that's not part
0.00%:  I was gonna mention it'
0.00%:  time to paint another
0.00%:  on that note I rest
0.00%:  at this rate I'm gonna keep
0.00%:  that means I'm a perfect
0.00%:  if I'm gonna paint more
0.00%:  I can't imagine a point when
0.00%:  I forgot that it
0.00%:  if I were to paint an image

0.01%:  I think I'm certain no one wants
0.00%:  it's him again in
0.00%:  each time I paint I get worse
0.00%:  on that note I'm taking a rain
0.00%:  I think I spent a few too
0.00%:  I'm certain I meant it as a joke.
0.00%:  I think we can start
0.00%:  I think I was certain
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it secret that
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna tear
0.00%:  part of me can't imagine that
0.00%:  I'm not the point

0.00%:  on this topic
0.00%:  that means I remain
0.00%:  that's one area
0.00%:  I mention that to make
0.00%:  now I think I'm certain it
0.00%:  now I'm making the point of
0.00%:  I was hoping to create
0.00%:  it's taken me an entire

0.00%:  I can't paint so great now
0.00%:  I am now free

0.00%:  nothing since
0.00%:  I was the one making it into

0.00%:  I forgot the point I
0.00%:  I know I'm the one raising
0.00%:  if I were to paint that same image
0.00%:  I'm not certain the image in
0.00%:  I can stop here

0.00%:  here I was making an
0.00%:  I know there's a paint
0.00%:  not to make

0.00%:  I know I'm the first one in
0.00%:  I know for a fact I meant the one in
0.00%:  now it's ten again
0.00%:  I'm not certain if what I meant

0.00%:  if I paint it again I can
0.00%:  there is not
0.00%:  I forgot I meant to paint
0.00%:  I can promise that if we
0.00%:  the main reason I'm not picking
0.00%:  it's more than one
0.00%:  that was coming from one
0.00%:  that one I meant
0.00%:  we're making that a
0.00%:  we're speaking in fiction
0.00%:  I'm working on that one.
0.00%:  I am certain no one is
0.00%:  I'm making no con
0.00%:  tonight'
0.00%:  I want to make the point
0.00%:  that's coming from an e

0.00%:  I see no point in taking
0.00%:  I can't think of a worse paint name
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint the rest
0.00%:  I was in the prime
0.00%:  I'm certain that I owe
0.00%:  I'm too far
0.00%:  I can't imagine if he
0.00%:  now I'm facing the fear
0.00%:  he was cart
0.00%:  if I were to paint tonight
0.00%:  now I can imagine the rest
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention that scene
0.00%:  I think it's now time for me to face a
0.00%:  I'm certain that image
0.00%:  I'm not a great paint
0.00%:  I'm st
0.00%:  I know I'm tiring
0.00%:  I was meaning to mention that piece
0.00%:  it's gonna take me for
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was fifteen
0.00%:  right now I'm off
0.01%:  right now I'm off to paint
0.00%:  I'm certain that means it
0.00%:  that means I'm nine for

0.00%:  I'm wearing pants.
0.00%:  I think it was on a green
0.01%:  I think it was on a green piece
0.00%:  I'm gonna take it home now
0.00%:  I think time for some
0.00%:  he was coming from
0.00%:  I'm gonna own that secret
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can think
0.00%:  I want to paint more so I can
0.00%:  on the topic of making
0.00%:  I meant the first point
0.00%:  I'm certain someone with a
0.00%:  now I'm gonna make it into a cart
0.00%:  I know he's not a painter of
0.00%:  one of them was an
0.00%:  that's me project
0.00%:  I know it's not a giant
0.00%:  I know this after

0.00%:  I can't speak for him
0.00%:  that's a known
0.00%:  her name's not
0.00%:  I think I paint too
0.00%:  I think we can agree I'm not too

0.00%:  if I'm making another
0.00%:  I saw it on a
0.00%:  none of that was a joke at
0.00%:  now I'm making that first
0.00%:  I'm at peace knowing that some
0.00%:  I promise I won't fight
0.00%:  I think if someone went
0.00%:  now I'm not speaking from the
0.00%:  I can't promise I meant the
0.00%:  a cartoon.
0.00%:  that for
0.00%:  I'm keeping it in the frame
0.00%:  I'm not a great think
0.00%:  I am not the painter I once
0.00%:  I'm certain the image is
0.00%:  I ate the paint after.
0.00%:  I'm the one making conf
0.00%:  I'm not waiting for some
0.00%:  now I'm keeping that fact
0.00%:  what I'm gonna paint
0.00%:  we can keep that on
0.00%:  I can't manage to make
0.00%:  that's not proof
0.00%:  I know he's coming for

0.00%:  I know I can't paint a more
0.00%:  I'm casting no

0.00%:  there was no cake
0.00%:  I'm not more
0.00%:  I'm the one asking for paint
0.00%:  now that's taken care of I
0.00%:  one time I spent an
0.00%:  I am not an artist
0.00%:  I was one of the more
0.00%:  I'm not whisper
0.00%:  I think once again we see
0.00%:  I know I pe
0.00%:  that's me coming in
0.00%:  at that point I was making
0.00%:  that one is now
0.00%:  I'm certain I was making an
0.00%:  at this point if
0.00%:  at this point if I were
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint from
0.00%:  since I'm not an art
0.00%:  I meant that in a sinc
0.00%:  none of them are mine

0.00%:  it was a piece I
0.00%:  I promise that I won't make a
0.00%:  I think I can own
0.00%:  I know it's not paint
0.00%:  I wanna keep that secret if
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint it a

0.00%:  I can't swear on a
0.00%:  I think me
0.00%:  I'm not picking a winner
0.00%:  I think I'm wrong to
0.00%:  now I'm naming these
0.00%:  one time I won
0.01%:  one time I won a contest
0.00%:  it's time for me to take a nap in
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm insane
0.00%:  I'm gonna pick that one
0.00%:  it was of the green
0.00%:  now I'm gonna open the
0.00%:  I knew that someone
0.00%:  one of his
0.00%:  I think i'm gonna paint some
0.00%:  nice
0.01%:  nice knowing
0.00%:  the reason I'm a man
0.00%:  the reason I'm a man of few
0.00%:  I promise not to make it an
0.00%:  that one is not

0.00%:  now I'm gonna eat more
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat more chips
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to them
0.00%:  it's gonna take a few more than nine
0.00%:  come to think of it I was nine. I
0.00%:  it's not a great conf
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm gonna
0.00%:  on that note I'm opening a new can
0.00%:  more than 
0.00%:  he's wearing a pink cam
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few me
0.00%:  that met
0.00%:  that means I'm an e
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that now I
0.00%:  now I'm someone
0.00%:  I keep an
0.00%:  it's mic
0.00%:  I can't imagine a worse time in
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to go nap in an
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it the same now
0.00%:  when I mention it to
0.00%:  I know this not from
0.00%:  now I can't imagine a more intense
0.00%:  I know the point
0.00%:  I know it's that one.
0.00%:  no point in making
0.01%:  no point in making that conf
0.00%:  I think I want to paint again since
0.00%:  I'm not certain if some
0.00%:  I'm poor at making
0.00%:  the reason I'm now an
0.00%: aa
0.00%:  there's ninja action

0.00%:  I was meaning the painter
0.00%:  I knew it at
0.01%:  I knew it at the time.
0.00%:  from now on I'm keeping this fact a
0.00%:  I'm certain that at no
0.00%:  at one point I might
0.00%:  it was a frame
0.00%:  that means I'm not a painter if we
0.00%:  I think I won some
0.00%:  that was in one
0.00%:  so now I'm certain
0.00%:  that's coming in at
0.00%:  I think I mean to paint again.
0.00%:  since I'm imag
0.00%:  now I am certain that I'm not speaking in

0.00%:  on that note we're gonna paint
0.00%:  I wanna paint more often so
0.00%:  then I was in art
0.00%:  I think it's gone now.

0.00%:  it cost
0.00%:  I'm now sitting in front of an
0.00%:  I can promise I won't name
0.00%:  now I'm forcing the met
0.00%:  I think we spent a
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna reach
0.00%:  now I am certain I am a
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that a conf
0.00%:  now it's not the
0.00%:  I know it's fifteen

0.00%:  I can't imagine what kept
0.00%:  some of that conf
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to gain
0.00%:  it was an attempt
0.00%:  I know that's not nice
0.00%:  I was the painter in
0.00%:  I was either making a conf
0.00%:  if I were to name him
0.00%:  I am not seeking
0.00%:  I'm certain of the meaning
0.00%:  it was not me
0.00%:  I was making it into a conf
0.00%:  now it's gonna take me another fifteen
0.00%:  I'm not gonna answer to
0.00%:  I think it means I'm gonna
0.00%:  that one is making
0.00%:  it's gonna wreck
0.00%:  after that I took
0.00%:  I'm open to change
0.00%:  now I'm taking the rest
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint him for
0.00%:  I know I'm not certain if that
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that face
0.00%:  I am not certain if he
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint one
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint one more
0.00%:  when I'm making

0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint faster now
0.00%:  now that's not coming
0.00%:  now I'm most certain of it.
0.00%:  these are two conf
0.00%:  I can't stop there. I
0.00%:  now I'm posting on

0.00%:  it was a remake of the
0.00%:  I'm hoping someone can
0.00%:  it might take
0.00%:  after that I went in
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it another
0.00%:  we're making him
0.00%:  it's an image of
0.00%:  part of this
0.01%:  part of this conf
0.00%:  I'm not gonna stop it either
0.00%:  I think I want to paint some again

0.00%:  I'm not picking it
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna eat some paint now.

0.00%:  it was an image I
0.00%:  I'm a ske
0.01%:  I'm a skeptic when

0.00%:  I'm not naming it
0.01%:  I'm not naming it after
0.00%:  I think it's time to go craw
0.00%:  it was an ap

0.00%:  if I spent
0.00%:  I'm aware that once
0.00%:  I was nine there
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna wait at

0.00%:  I was gonna conf
0.00%:  that's if
0.00%:  I got one star
0.00%:  I was at the cinema
0.00%:  in case I'm making it
0.00%:  I'm gonna rest

0.00%:  if I were to make a conf
0.00%:  that's not a warning
0.00%:  I promise I can't make

0.01%:  I'm certain I meant none of it as a joke
0.00%:  I think it was facing
0.00%:  I know I spent more time eating
0.00%:  I'm speaking in front of a non
0.00%:  I meant the painter.
0.00%:  I can't paint him wearing

0.00%:  I know it's not a great piece
0.00%:  now I'm gonna eat this paint
0.00%:  I think it's a giant
0.00%:  when I imagine a master
0.00%:  I want to paint things more
0.00%:  the main reason I keep mention
0.00%:  I am aware those
0.00%:  that was one point for
0.00%:  no matter who I am speaking
0.00%:  on top of that I
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint more than two

0.00%:  knowing these
0.00%:  I'm certain no one knows the
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint that same
0.00%:  I'm not wearing pants. I think
0.00%:  that was a con
0.00%:  I'm not his
0.00%:  I know that isn't a perfect
0.00%:  I swear I'm not making the conf
0.00%:  new conf
0.00%:  I think I'm coming off as one
0.00%:  I want to keep hearing

0.00%:  that is not me
0.00%:  I think it was more of an ap
0.00%:  I can't wait for the opening

0.00%:  I'm not certain what meaning
0.00%:  if I went to
0.01%:  if I went to prison
0.00%:  come to think of it I'm nin
0.00%:  I think I'm w
0.00%:  I got three

0.00%:  I spit on him after

0.00%:  I make no effort
0.00%:  I know the image of
0.00%:  he's making a peace
0.00%:  I'm certain that at one
0.00%:  I'm perfect at
0.00%:  then I won't paint again for at
0.00%:  I want to make a time
0.00%:  that means I'm writing in
0.00%:  I know I'm coming off as e
0.00%:  I am now pain
0.00%:  I'm not on speaker
0.00%:  knowing the
0.00%:  I can't wait for him to mention
0.00%:  that was meant to confirm
0.00%:  that makes me a 
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write fan fiction one

0.00%:  the main reason I won
0.02%:  the main reason I won't paint
0.00%:  I can't make that promise I
0.00%:  I forgot it was an
0.00%:  it's not the main
0.00%:  in fact I am
0.00%:  I think I ate paint for
0.00%:  I was fifteen at the time. I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint it as often
0.00%:  I'm not gonna open this

0.00%:  since neither
0.00%:  I'm gonna take a shot
0.00%:  I make no mention of this in
0.00%:  if we're gonna name paint then
0.00%:  I'm not one of the main
0.00%:  I think it's canon.
0.00%:  I think I'm major
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna paint this time
0.00%:  now I'm sorta hoping

0.00%:  I'm at work
0.00%:  I can promise I won't mention that in a
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make that face
0.00%:  I know it means

0.00%:  that was me at nine.
0.00%:  there cannot
0.00%:  we're not a
0.00%:  I think I meant to pre

0.00%:  I know that on
0.00%:  I know for a fact I'm not in the same
0.00%:  I'm the first one I
0.00%:  now I'm making certain that
0.00%:  I'm certain the mention
0.00%:  I'm certain it was fifteen
0.00%:  that's a major
0.00%:  I'm not writing that in

0.00%:  I want to paint more things.
0.00%:  the reason I'm now 
0.00%:  I'm not certain how to get
0.00%:  I think it was a generic
0.00%:  I'm gonna print this one on
0.00%:  if we're making that
0.00%:  if we're making that conf
0.00%:  that's it from me.
0.00%:  I'm scar
0.00%:  now he can't paint again
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna come
0.00%:  if I were to paint it again then
0.00%:  I'm gonna make this a conf
0.00%:  it was a magic
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint me

0.00%:  I'm not certain the point was
0.00%:  I am making a conf
