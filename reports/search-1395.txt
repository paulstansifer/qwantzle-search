0.06%:  if I can

0.06%:  nothing makes
0.09%:  nothing makes me want
0.06%:  to make
0.08%:  to make things
0.06%:  now I'm taking this conf
0.06%:  that makes me a winner
0.06%:  I can't imagine a worse fate
0.06%:  I think it was meant for
0.06%:  I promise I won't make that a
0.06%:  I'm a man
0.06%:  it was fr
0.06%:  then I ate a

0.03%:  now it's time to make
0.03%:  I can't paint him
0.03%:  I know I'm not an artist.
0.03%:  I meant that in an
0.03%:  after that we
0.03%:  the main reason I'm not taking

0.03%:  the reason I'm not mention
0.03%:  now I'm not conf
0.03%:  that makes me pain
0.03%:  I think it went from

0.03%:  I know it can
0.03%:  I'm not too certain what
0.03%:  I'm not certain it went
0.03%:  I'm one of those pain
0.03%:  it was that
0.03%:  it was that one
0.03%:  now I think I'm in
0.03%:  it was gonna
0.03%:  I'm too ash
0.03%:  now I am certain of it.
0.03%:  I think I'm gonna paint more if

0.03%:  somehow it
0.03%:  time for a
0.03%:  I think it's time for me to pain
0.03%:  I can't think of a worse opening
0.03%:  I want to go paint some

0.02%:  we're at an
0.02%:  that is a fact
0.02%:  when it comes to paint I
0.02%:  I think we can agree I'm a
0.02%:  that's gonna wrap
0.02%:  that one was more
0.02%:  I'm now coming to the

0.02%:  I think I'm in some
0.02%:  none of that takes
0.02%:  it was taken from the
0.02%:  that reason
0.02%:  I think at some point I came
0.02%:  I think it was after I'
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for the
0.02%:  that means I'm wrong
0.02%:  I think after I
0.02%:  we can see that
0.02%:  then it got
0.02%:  it's not an ap
0.02%:  after this I'm not
0.02%:  I forgot his weapon
0.02%:  I want some of

0.03%:  each time I mention it
0.02%:  I promise not to take
0.02%:  I'm not certain if I meant it as a joke.
0.02%:  I'm aware that it makes
0.02%:  I want that on
0.02%:  I'm gonna take this paint
0.02%:  now I'm naming the paint
0.02%:  I won't mention his name to

0.02%:  I know I'm the first to
0.06%:  I know I'm the first to mention
0.02%:  I think we can forget I
0.02%:  now I'm fine
0.02%:  that one time I wrote fan
0.02%:  I think if I were to paint again someone
0.02%:  I'm making the entire scene
0.02%:  I think it's time for me to nap.
0.02%:  neither can
0.02%:  he's wearing a jet
0.07%:  he's wearing a jet pack
0.02%:  that one's gonna come
0.02%:  the reason I came into

0.02%:  that's not one
0.02%:  that time I'm not
0.02%:  I hope I'm not making it worse
0.02%:  none of that was conf
0.02%:  I was keeping that from
0.02%:  I know that if I paint
0.06%:  I know that if I paint again
0.02%:  I spent an entire month making it
0.02%:  that it'
0.02%:  I'm mention
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint at
0.02%:  I can't promise when

0.02%:  I'm the painter
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret in
0.02%:  that was a joke for

0.02%:  I think I'm a great
0.02%:  I'm certain that I knew
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that into
0.02%:  I think one reason
0.02%:  coming to
0.02%:  for a
0.08%:  for a moment
0.03%:  for a moment I was
0.02%:  when I paint again it's not

0.08%:  I can't imagine a point where
0.02%:  we're on the same
0.02%:  actions

0.02%:  I can't stop the
0.02%:  I'm gonna make it a
0.11%:  I'm gonna make it a secret
0.07%:  I'm gonna make it a secret now
0.02%:  that means I'm in a
0.02%:  I was the one making it
0.02%:  now I'm speaking too
0.02%:  none of this came from
0.02%:  speaking of ninja action
0.02%:  once again I'm the reason we

0.04%:  none of them were
0.02%:  I'm at the age
0.02%:  I'm not a painter. I think

0.02%:  I was hoping none
0.02%:  part of me thinks I can
0.03%:  part of me thinks I can't imagine
0.02%:  I know it's not fair to name
0.02%:  I know none of that means I'm a
0.02%:  I think I meant to compare
0.02%:  I'm speaking of him

0.02%:  I think we're in a
0.02%:  I know that isn't canon
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that again
0.02%:  now I'm certain things
0.02%:  it was on the front of an ice
0.02%:  now I can't shake

0.02%:  that paint was
0.02%:  I know he's a cartoon.
0.02%:  that one went
0.02%:  I am the reason we
0.02%:  I am the reason we can

0.02%:  it was on that one
0.02%:  it was on that one piece
0.02%:  it was neither
0.02%:  it was in green c
0.02%:  that means we're not gonna make it in
0.02%:  I'm not so certain what

0.02%:  it's making me want another
0.02%:  I'm not gonna paint a new
0.02%:  I'm certain I want to paint
0.02%:  now I can't think of a more
0.02%:  the master
0.02%:  now I'm insane
0.02%:  at this point I can't imagine a
0.05%:  at this point I can't imagine a more
0.02%:  now I'm eating the
0.05%:  now I'm eating the paint

0.02%:  I think I spent more time n
0.02%:  we're not meant to take
0.02%:  I'm not certain he was in
0.02%:  I'm a master
0.02%:  I'm not on
0.18%:  I'm not on speaking

0.02%:  I know not
0.02%:  I know neither one
0.02%:  I can't imagine a time in the past
0.02%:  if I was a painter I might not
0.02%:  I'm not certain if that one was
0.02%:  when it comes to making art
0.02%:  I'm gonna repeat this
0.02%:  I think I'm off to paint again.
0.02%:  I might not paint
0.02%:  I know I can't promise
0.02%:  since I'm writing
0.02%:  the reason I mention it
0.02%:  the reason I mention it now
0.02%:  I imagine we
0.03%:  I imagine we can
0.02%:  I think I'm eating a
0.02%:  fifteen
0.02%:  once again it's time for the
0.02%:  I might not want
0.02%:  if I were making a
0.02%:  I want to make another
0.02%:  I think I ate some paint.
0.02%:  on that note I'm gonna skip

0.02%:  I think if someone came
0.02%:  we're opening
0.02%:  somehow I can't imagine a painter
0.02%:  the main reason I came
0.02%:  I'm aware that someone
0.02%:  if I paint another one of
0.02%:  confirm
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep this train
0.02%:  now I'm t
0.02%:  now I'm tasting
0.02%:  if we're gonna name names I think it

0.02%:  I took art
0.02%:  it's gonna take me more than ten
0.02%:  I threw it in
0.02%:  I think it's time we got
0.02%:  now I'm certain that means
0.02%:  now I'm certain nothing
