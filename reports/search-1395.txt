0.05%:  I think if I was a
0.05%:  I think I wanna forget
0.05%:  I am speaking of
0.05%:  I know it's a giant
0.05%:  I can't promise I meant to
0.05%:  I think I want to paint more of
0.05%:  on that note I'm gonna write an
0.08%:  on that note I'm gonna write an epic
0.05%:  now I'm ten
0.10%:  now I'm ten again.
0.05%:  I went on to paint a
0.05%:  I know none of this pain
0.05%:  now I'm not that certain
0.05%:  I'm not seeing the
0.05%:  I won't repeat the
0.05%:  here I come again
0.05%:  I think I want to mention
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna paint no
0.05%:  I think I sort of meant
0.05%:  I'm so not
0.05%:  I'm now making it
0.05%:  that's it for me man
0.05%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret.
0.05%:  now that makes
0.05%:  that I'm now
0.05%:  I'm not gonna make it to
0.05%:  if someone were to paint
0.05%:  I'm not speaking in front of the
0.05%:  it was after a
0.05%:  I meant that conf
0.05%:  I mean that in more
0.05%:  I think I sort of want
0.05%:  that means we can forget
0.05%:  I spent the morning
0.05%:  there I was making an
0.05%:  I promise not to make it a thing
0.05%:  I went to conf
0.05%:  I'm most certain I won
0.05%:  I think I can see a few
0.05%:  I mean it in a
0.05%:  it's now time for a
0.05%:  I am making no effort
0.05%:  I'm gonna take that opinion
0.05%:  one more thing. I'
0.05%:  I can't imagine a time when not
0.05%:  he's not wearing a pink
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna want to paint
0.06%:  I think I'm gonna want to paint more
0.05%:  it's gonna take more than a few com
0.05%:  I meant the cartoon.
0.05%:  when it came time for sign
0.05%:  I know for a fact I meant the
0.05%:  I think one reason I paint
0.05%:  I think it's a crime
0.05%:  I'm not certain if I knew
0.06%:  I'm not certain if I knew that
0.05%:  that means I'm a fake
0.05%:  it's gonna take at
0.05%:  I swear I'm gonna paint a
0.05%:  I think for once
0.05%:  I'm certain I want to paint
0.05%:  there's no point in me taking a
0.05%:  I promise I won't mention the t
0.05%:  now I'm off the
0.10%:  now I'm off the paint
0.10%:  now I'm off the paint train
0.07%:  now I'm off the paint train again
0.05%:  now I'm off the topic
0.05%:  now I'm off the paint again
0.05%:  now I'm off the paint team
0.05%:  that's not at
0.05%:  I'm certain that a
0.05%:  it was one I
0.05%:  since I forgot
0.07%:  since I forgot to paint
0.05%:  now I'm making a scene in the paint
0.05%:  there was no point making
0.05%:  I'm certain that makes it
0.05%:  when it comes to making art
0.05%:  I think I mean to paint more often in
0.05%:  I'm a jerk
0.05%:  when I got
0.05%:  I'm certain that none of it was in
0.05%:  it was from an image in the
0.05%:  now that I'm not
0.05%:  right
0.15%:  right now I'm not
0.06%:  right now I'm 
0.05%:  right now I am
0.05%:  it was on a cake for
0.05%:  it's from
0.05%:  once again I think it's time for an
0.05%:  now I can't stop mention
0.05%:  I'm not certain as
0.05%:  I think it's time for me to win a
0.05%:  I'm not certain that one is a
0.05%:  after that point
0.05%:  I'm not that awesome
0.05%:  the point I'm making is if
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna paint it in water
0.05%:  I think once
0.49%:  I think once again
0.12%:  I think once again we
0.08%:  I think once again I'm not
0.05%:  I think once again it
0.23%:  I think once again it's time for a
0.22%:  I think once again it's time for a nap
0.21%:  I think once again it's time to
0.12%:  I think once again it's time for a new
0.05%:  I think once again it's time for a nap.
0.05%:  I am not aware
0.05%:  I'm gonna take that nin
0.05%:  I think we can agree I am
0.05%:  now I'm making the entire scene
0.05%:  I'm gonna make this into
0.05%:  I think now I see
0.05%:  that moment
0.05%:  that means I'm not a painter now.
0.05%:  that I'm not wearing
0.05%:  neither am
0.05%:  I think it's time to renew
0.05%:  on that note I'm gonna skip
0.05%:  since I'm not a painter I think it
0.05%:  then I kept
0.05%:  I'm gonna own that mistake
0.05%:  I'm now certain I meant
0.05%:  I think I meant to imagine
0.05%:  I think I conf
0.05%:  if I paint another one it
0.41%:  if I paint another one it's gonna
0.11%:  if I paint another one it's gonna take
0.15%:  if I paint another one it's gonna take me
0.10%:  if I paint another one it's gonna make
0.05%:  I can't imagine an artist who
0.05%:  I'm not a painter in the same
0.05%:  I think I can see it now
0.05%:  the reason I'm waiting
0.05%:  I think I'm not winning
0.05%:  I think it's now time for a nice nap.
0.05%:  it's time for a new h
0.05%:  I know I'm stating
0.05%:  I think if I were to mention
0.05%:  I'm not that into nin
0.05%:  I know that someone'
0.05%:  now I gotta paint another
0.05%:  I was trick
0.05%:  the one I
0.05%:  I'm aware that speaking in
0.05%:  I'm certain none of that makes paint
0.05%:  now I'm gonna sit in
0.05%:  it's fine
0.05%:  I think we're gonna paint soon
0.05%:  I wanna come
0.05%:  I know for a fact I meant the one
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna write a son
0.05%:  I keep it in a frame that
0.05%:  I want a cookie for
0.05%:  I'm not wearing pants on
0.05%:  I'm a man who keeps
0.05%:  it was in green paint.
0.05%:  that was no
0.05%:  I promise I won't mention the cat again
0.05%:  now I'm certain that means
0.05%:  we're making no
0.05%:  I know I'm not sharing
0.05%:  I'm certain I am not
0.05%:  now I'm making the case for paint
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna paint more one
0.05%:  other
0.05%:  I know it's not fair to paint him
0.05%:  I'm making the rest
0.05%:  I know I'm sitting in
0.05%:  I think time
0.05%:  it's gonna take time
0.05%:  I'm hitting
0.05%:  I'm not perfect
0.05%:  I think I meant to write an
0.05%:  it got
0.05%:  I'm not certain if it wasn
0.05%:  I'm one of the worst
0.05%:  that means I can imagine
0.05%:  there's no point now in
0.05%:  I know I'm racist
0.05%:  it's time to wrap
0.05%:  I'm certain I knew nothing
0.05%:  I'm gonna paint this one for
0.05%:  it's gonna take more than fine
0.05%:  now I think I'm confirm
0.05%:  I'm not gonna mention if it was in
0.05%:  I mean I'm not
0.05%:  it was a green
0.05%:  that's me writing
0.05%:  I kept it in
0.21%:  I kept it in a frame
0.10%:  I kept it in a frame on
0.07%:  I kept it in a frame in
0.05%:  I know that's iron
0.05%:  he's got
0.05%:  we can forget this
0.05%:  I think it's time for me to go in a
0.05%:  now I'm not gonna paint either.
0.05%:  at this point in time
0.05%:  at this point in time I'm gonna
0.05%:  I'm most certain that if I keep
0.05%:  we're not gonna take
0.05%:  we're not gonna take that
0.05%:  if I'm speaking
0.05%:  I ate a
0.05%:  now I can't get either
0.05%:  I know I spent more time on it
0.05%:  it was the front
0.05%:  for that I am
0.05%:  I think if I can paint
0.05%:  it's 
0.05%:  that's not a point in
0.05%:  there's no joke
0.05%:  I'm not waiting to
0.05%:  I'm not waiting to hear
0.05%:  I can't imagine another point of
0.05%:  I'm speaking in front of two
0.05%:  I know none of that is an
0.05%:  we're not making this
0.05%:  now I can't go home
0.05%:  I know it's that one
0.05%:  I think it's time I went on an
0.05%:  I know I'm not in a
0.05%:  I wanna keep this conf
0.05%:  I'm certain that in no
0.05%:  none of that means I can't paint if
0.05%:  now I can't imagine there
0.05%:  that makes me want paint
0.05%:  when I first
0.05%:  after I paint it
0.05%:  the main reason I'm conf
0.05%:  now I'm opening a
0.13%:  now I'm opening a can
0.05%:  it's gonna take more than a few joint
0.05%:  I know some of that
0.05%:  I know I'm not gonna paint this
0.05%:  it's gonna take effort
0.05%:  now I can paint
0.31%:  now I can paint again
0.05%:  none of that means I can't win
0.05%:  I imagine that one
0.05%:  time for me to go paint
0.05%:  I'm ok
0.05%:  I'm gonna paint the new
0.05%:  we're making some
0.05%:  that's not an image I can
0.05%:  I threw in a
0.05%:  I think I forget
0.05%:  the reason I want to keep
0.05%:  I meant to point
0.05%:  as a painter
0.05%:  we're not speaking of him
0.05%:  I think I'm not wearing
0.07%:  I think I'm not wearing pants.
0.05%:  there I was making conf
0.05%:  I promise I won't come
0.05%:  I think I spent more time ag
0.05%:  I know I can't imagine the
0.05%:  now I'm forcing this
0.05%:  if that conf
0.05%:  now it's gone from
0.05%:  I might want to paint more in
0.05%:  I'm gonna paint the scene
0.05%:  I'm not making new
0.05%:  I'm asking for the
0.05%:  I'm waiting patient
0.05%:  I can't stop mention
0.05%:  it's gonna take more paint
0.06%:  it's gonna take more paint than I own
0.05%:  I forgot it was a
0.05%:  I forgot it was a conf
0.05%:  I'm not certain if knowing these
0.05%:  I'm gonna keep that one secret if
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna paint a tree.
0.05%:  I'm certain it won
0.05%:  I know that time
0.05%:  I think it's time for me go paint a
0.07%:  I think it's time for me go paint a new
0.10%:  I think it's time for me go paint a new one
0.05%:  on that note I am off
0.05%:  can we agree
0.12%:  can we agree that I
0.09%:  can we agree that'
0.08%:  can we agree that's not
0.05%:  can we agree that I'm not
0.05%:  when it comes time to paint
0.72%:  when it comes time to paint again
0.26%:  when it comes time to paint again I
0.05%:  I'm coming to the point
0.05%:  I can't think of one artist
0.05%:  it was then
0.05%:  I promise I won't make that one again.
0.05%:  I'm certain that was me
0.05%:  I think I'm gonna rest
0.05%:  I think if I'm gonna paint someone
0.05%:  I'm keeping that nin
0.14%:  I'm keeping that ninja secret
0.05%:  now I'm off the topic again
0.05%:  now I'm sitting here at
0.05%:  I forgot to paint in his face
0.05%:  I think it was me in

0.05%:  I know I'm gonna hear
0.05%:  I'm gonna paint for
0.10%:  I'm gonna paint for the
0.05%:  I'm gonna keep that one fact

0.05%:  I spent more time on that
0.05%:  we're not gonna mention that a
0.05%:  I knew this conf
0.05%:  as it
0.05%:  that was not an
0.05%:  there's a giant pink
0.05%:  since I'm gonna

0.05%:  we're not taking this one
0.05%:  now I'm off to paint.
0.05%:  I'm making this part
0.05%:  we're not off
0.05%:  now I'm gonna paint the most
0.05%:  then I know
0.05%:  it's not gonna win
0.05%:  I was gonna mention that in
0.05%:  it was the one I
0.05%:  it's gonna take more than a pin
0.05%:  at this point I can't make
0.05%:  I'm certain none of those paint
0.05%:  now I'm gonna paint that.
0.05%:  I can't think of a more awesome nin
0.05%:  I can't wait for this
0.05%:  I know that since I'm not
0.05%:  I can't think of a worse ep
0.05%:  that's not a joke.
0.05%:  there's a one in ten
0.05%:  it's gonna take time for
0.05%:  I think we're at a point in time
0.05%:  there was no point in me making
0.05%:  I think I want to paint again in
0.05%:  it's taking
0.05%:  can someone
0.05%:  it's taking me
0.05%:  I'm gonna paint more now.

0.04%:  the point I was
0.74%:  the point I was making
0.04%:  I can't promise not to again in
0.04%:  I know that's a crime

0.04%:  now I'm sitting on a
0.04%:  I'm writing in
0.04%:  there's no point in me making a conf
0.04%:  I think I won't paint again from
0.04%:  what makes
0.04%:  I know it's not a fair fight
0.04%:  I am now certain I'm the
0.04%:  since I'm not an

0.04%:  I can't take the
0.04%:  the paint was in
0.04%:  there's no point in making a com
0.04%:  now I can't imagine not

0.04%:  it's gonna take more than a 
0.04%:  that means we're on
0.04%:  it was a fan fiction.
0.04%:  then I went into a com
