0.07%:  I hope I'm not making it
0.07%:  it's not fair
0.07%:  I'm not certain that speaking of
0.07%:  I think it was for
0.07%:  I know it's pat
0.07%:  when it came to making
0.07%:  I was gonna frame
0.07%:  since I know nothing
0.07%:  I'm not one to
0.07%:  I'm not certain that I wasn
0.07%:  I think I'm staring
0.07%:  I can't keep this
0.07%:  now I'm making these
0.07%:  I promise I won't mention it again than
0.07%:  I'm gonna wait here
0.07%:  I'm certain I was not
0.07%:  I'm certain no one wants to imagine the
0.07%:  I'm gonna keep this a
0.07%:  none of that's a
0.09%:  none of that's a conf
0.08%:  none of that's a joke
0.07%:  I am now making
0.07%:  when I paint I imagine
0.07%:  now that I'm 
0.07%:  the reason I came in
0.07%:  it's making me wanna
0.07%:  I'm now certain that none
0.07%:  none of that means I can't keep writing
0.07%:  I can't think of one person
0.07%:  I am making
0.07%:  I'm waiting for the time
0.07%:  I'm gonna paint that scene for
0.07%:  I'm not certain I want this
0.07%:  I'm now certain of
0.07%:  now I think I'm gonna paint one

0.07%:  now I can't promise
0.07%:  I think I was nine
0.07%:  if that's not a perfect
0.07%:  I think it's more of
0.13%:  I think it's more of a conf
0.08%:  I think it's more of a met
0.07%:  I mean that as
0.07%:  if I paint
0.27%:  if I paint again
0.13%:  if I paint again I
0.11%:  if I paint another
0.14%:  if I paint another one I
0.39%:  if I paint another one I'm gonna
0.10%:  if I paint another one now
0.10%:  if I paint another one I'm gonna make
0.07%:  I was hoping I
0.07%:  now I'm making it into a conf
0.07%:  I'm now 
0.07%:  I think I'm gonna frame it in
0.07%:  it remains
0.07%:  I forgot to paint the ninja'
0.10%:  I forgot to paint the ninja's face
0.07%:  what'
0.17%:  what's more
0.07%:  I think I was coming from
0.07%:  since when am I a
0.45%:  since when am I a painter
0.07%:  the reason I'm not an
0.07%:  I think I'm gonna answer
0.07%:  I'm certain now
0.07%:  I think it's time for an ep
0.07%:  I'm making it worse than
0.07%:  in that moment I was certain
0.07%:  I think I'm reg
0.07%:  I threw in
0.07%:  I can see nothing
0.07%:  I want to paint it again.
0.07%:  I was making him
0.07%:  then I went into a
0.07%:  I can't promise that none of it
0.07%:  I'm not certain whose name
0.07%:  I know it for
0.07%:  I think it's time for a com
0.07%:  I was ten again the
0.07%:  I won't promise
0.08%:  I won't promise that
0.07%:  I'm posting
0.07%:  I know for a fact that it'
0.07%:  at this point I know I'm not
0.07%:  I think it's time for an epic
0.07%:  now I'm making it easier
0.07%:  I'm not certain it was in
0.07%:  I'm not certain I meant it as a joke.
0.07%:  that one was from
0.07%:  that's coming from a pain
0.07%:  I promise I won't make that into
0.07%:  it was 
0.07%:  I keep writing that
0.07%:  now I'm speaking met
0.07%:  I'm certain that nin
0.07%:  I think I was gonna name
0.07%:  I think I'm gonna scream
0.07%:  now I'm taking that
0.07%:  I was making that one
0.07%:  a conf
0.07%:  that was one conf
0.07%:  I'm certain of it now.
0.07%:  I am making this
0.07%:  I'm certain that if we
0.07%:  I promise I won't go
0.07%:  I'm certain that is
0.07%:  I spent an entire week on
0.07%:  I can't paint in
0.07%:  I'm in the
0.07%:  I think I can see it in
0.07%:  he was not
0.07%:  that's it for me. I can
0.07%:  the reason I'm not mention
0.07%:  now I'm so
0.07%:  I know this from
0.07%:  I promise I won't name that
0.07%:  I think it's time for a nap now. I
0.07%:  that means I know I'm not
0.07%:  that one is canon
0.07%:  I'm not making a secret
0.07%:  I think I'm gonna eat a
0.07%:  if I were to paint again then
0.07%:  now I'm not certain if it makes
0.07%:  I'm aware that making
0.07%:  I keep meaning to frame that one
0.07%:  if I were to paint a scene
0.07%:  there was no nin
0.07%:  he's not wearing a c
0.13%:  he's not wearing a cape in
0.07%:  I'm not that great an
0.07%:  I know there's paint
0.07%:  I promise that if
0.07%:  now I'm speaking in a
0.07%:  when I'
0.07%:  I know it's time to change
0.07%:  I think if I'm not
0.07%:  I spent a week
0.07%:  I'm most certain none
0.07%:  that one was me
0.07%:  I'm not gonna ask
0.07%:  I'm not gonna ask for
0.07%:  that I'm speaking
0.07%:  that I'm speaking from
0.07%:  that was in a
0.07%:  I got an
0.07%:  one more thing.
0.07%:  I meant it in the most
0.07%:  speaking from
0.07%:  I'm not certain I see what
0.07%:  I know I'm not gonna paint him
0.07%:  I'm one of those
0.07%:  there's no point in taking a
0.07%:  I can't stop either
0.07%:  that makes me a giant
0.07%:  I think I'm someone
0.07%:  I think I'm perfect
0.07%:  I think we're off
0.15%:  I think we're off topic
0.09%:  I think we're off topic again
0.07%:  I know it's not fair to imagine
0.07%:  I wanna see that
0.07%:  I think I'm now certain of
0.07%:  to answer the
0.07%:  now there's paint
0.07%:  I was gonna keep that one in
0.07%:  I was not making
0.07%:  after that I was
0.07%:  we're gonna keep this one
0.07%:  the more I mention
0.07%:  I'm certain it was on
0.07%:  I'm most certain of the
0.07%:  that one time I was nine
0.07%:  that I'm not certain
0.07%:  I think I'm not great
0.07%:  it's gonna take me another few
0.07%:  there was no one
0.07%:  I can't seem to make
0.07%:  then we
0.07%:  now I'm making it so that
0.07%:  I know I'm ram
0.07%:  it's gonna take me more than nine
0.07%:  I'm not opening
0.10%:  I'm not opening that
0.07%:  I think if I went
0.07%:  none of that came
0.07%:  since I'm not a painter at
0.07%:  I'm certain that I was making
0.07%:  I promise I won't mention it in a
0.07%:  I swear I'm not gonna make that
0.07%:  it's gonna take more than an ice
0.07%:  I know that means it
0.07%:  I think some part
0.07%:  that's coming from a point
0.07%:  that was me making conf
0.07%:  I know I can't paint the
0.07%:  I imagine I was
0.07%:  now I'm gonna make it
0.07%:  I know it's not canon.
0.07%:  I'm not certain that we
0.07%:  I think I went into
0.07%:  I think I can paint again
0.07%:  I keep meaning to throw it
0.07%:  that means I can't make
0.07%:  I can't paint again
0.07%:  I think it's perfect
0.07%:  I know I'm not gonna paint the
0.07%:  the entire point
0.07%:  I conf
0.07%:  what if
0.07%:  I can't paint with
0.07%:  I'm gonna keep that first
0.07%:  now I imagine
0.07%:  that's more conf
0.07%:  that means we're not gonna make
0.07%:  that means we're not gonna make it in
0.07%:  now there's an
0.07%:  I'm not so certain I meant
0.07%:  I forgot to paint him in
0.07%:  that's part
0.07%:  I know there's no point in acting
0.07%:  I am speaking from
0.07%:  that means I can't paint now
0.07%:  I'm not gonna paint it either
0.07%:  I promise I won't mention that nin
0.07%:  I think it's time for me to nap.
0.07%:  now I am speaking
0.07%:  I think we can agree to
0.07%:  I promise to make
0.07%:  I think it's more of an
0.07%:  he can't paint
0.07%:  I am not certain what
0.07%:  I think it was from an
0.18%:  I think it was from an action
0.07%:  here I'
0.07%:  I'm writing it
0.07%:  now I'm certain that speaking of
0.07%:  I'm gonna write that into
0.07%:  it's gonna make
0.07%:  at this point I'm gonna come
0.07%:  there's no point acting
0.07%:  I'm sitting here in a
0.07%:  I think I can't stop
0.07%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret in
0.07%:  I know none of that'
0.07%:  I'm the worst
0.07%:  I'm gonna keep that answer
0.07%:  I'm setting
0.07%:  I'm picking
0.07%:  I am now certain of
0.07%:  I think it's gonna remain a
0.07%:  I think it's one
0.07%:  I'm waiting for a
0.07%:  that's proof I
0.07%:  I think we're coming to an

0.07%:  I threw it
0.07%:  I know I meant to paint
0.07%:  I know I'm not the artist
0.07%:  that means I get
0.07%:  I think I went on
0.07%:  I'm making that face
0.07%:  I know it's time for me to paint a

0.05%:  there was a cat
0.05%:  that one time I won
0.05%:  now I can't stop mention
0.05%:  none of that means I can't paint if
0.05%:  I think if I were to mention
0.05%:  now I'm certain that in
0.05%:  I spent the morning
0.05%:  none of that means I'm not an
0.05%:  I think I want to paint more one
0.05%:  I think it's time for me to go in a
0.05%:  now I'm not gonna paint either.

0.03%:  I know I'm gonna paint this
0.03%:  it was a par
0.03%:  I know it's not a great name
0.03%:  I'm gonna see if I can make a
0.03%:  I can imagine some
0.03%:  it's more
0.08%:  it's more than
0.10%:  it's more than a conf
0.03%:  that one time I ran
0.03%:  I'm the same painter
0.03%:  now I'm gonna keep this
0.03%:  now I'm gonna keep this conf
