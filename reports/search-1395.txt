0.07%:  it was in green paint
0.06%:  if I can
0.13%:  if I can't paint

0.06%:  I think most
0.06%:  we're not gonna mention the fact I
0.06%:  that makes no

0.06%:  nothing makes
0.09%:  nothing makes me want
0.06%:  to make
0.08%:  to make things
0.06%:  now I'm taking this conf
0.06%:  that makes me a winner
0.06%:  I can't imagine a worse fate
0.06%:  I think it was meant for
0.06%:  I promise I won't make that a
0.06%:  I'm a man
0.06%:  it was fr
0.06%:  then I ate a
0.06%:  I can see where I
0.06%:  then I went to
0.06%:  no matter how I spin it I'm not

0.06%:  I was meaning to mention it
0.06%:  I'm not gonna make it easier
0.06%:  now I'm certain that if someone
0.06%:  I was a jerk to him
0.06%:  it's gonna take more than ten
0.06%:  it was in front
0.07%:  it was in front of the

0.03%:  I'm not certain that isn
0.03%:  I'm hoping I
0.03%:  we're past the conf
0.03%:  I think it's more of a met
0.03%:  that's it for me. I can
0.03%:  I was j
0.05%:  I was joking the
0.14%:  I was joking the entire
0.10%:  I was joking the entire time.
0.03%:  that makes me want to go

0.10%:  at some point I'm gonna
0.10%:  at some point in
0.05%:  at some point I'm certain
0.04%:  at some point I think I'
0.04%:  at some point I went
0.05%:  at some point I went from
0.03%:  once again I'm the worst
0.03%:  I'm forcing
0.03%:  now I'm seeing the
0.03%:  I can't promise that we
0.03%:  I know I'm gonna paint that
0.03%:  now I'm n
0.13%:  now I'm naming the

0.02%:  I'm not gonna write it
0.02%:  that was me on
0.02%:  after I'
0.02%:  none of that matters in
0.02%:  if we can
0.02%:  that makes me a nin
0.02%:  it's gonna take me another few
0.02%:  I know I'm not 
0.02%:  now I'm making it a secret

0.02%:  I know I can't paint.
0.02%:  we're at an
0.02%:  that is a fact
0.02%:  when it comes to paint I
0.02%:  I think we can agree I'm a
0.02%:  that's gonna wrap
0.02%:  that one was more
0.02%:  I'm now coming to the
0.02%:  if we're gonna name names I think
0.02%:  I know that I'm not gonna
0.02%:  none of that means I can't paint now
0.02%:  I'm not too keen
0.02%:  on that note I am off

0.02%:  once again we see
0.03%:  once again we see that
0.02%:  I swear I'm not gonna make that
0.02%:  I keep that fr
0.02%:  now I'm gonna take that
0.02%:  I think I'm in some
0.02%:  none of that takes
0.02%:  it was taken from the
0.02%:  that reason
0.02%:  I think at some point I came
0.02%:  I think it was after I'
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint for the
0.02%:  that means I'm wrong
0.02%:  I think after I
0.02%:  we can see that
0.02%:  then it got
0.02%:  it's not an ap
0.02%:  after this I'm not
0.02%:  I forgot his weapon
0.02%:  I want some of
0.02%:  that one came from
0.02%:  that one's canon.
0.02%:  each

0.10%:  each time I mention
0.04%:  each time I paint
0.03%:  each time I mention it
0.02%:  I promise not to take
0.02%:  I'm not certain if I meant it as a joke.
0.02%:  I'm aware that it makes
0.02%:  I want that on
0.02%:  I'm gonna take this paint
0.02%:  now I'm naming the paint
0.02%:  I won't mention his name to

0.02%:  I know I'm the first to
0.06%:  I know I'm the first to mention
0.02%:  I think we can forget I
0.02%:  now I'm fine
0.02%:  that one time I wrote fan
0.02%:  I think if I were to paint again someone
0.02%:  I'm making the entire scene
0.02%:  I think it's time for me to nap.
0.02%:  neither can
0.02%:  he's wearing a jet
0.07%:  he's wearing a jet pack
0.02%:  that one's gonna come
0.02%:  the reason I came into
0.02%:  he was not in
0.02%:  that's not one
0.02%:  that time I'm not
0.02%:  I hope I'm not making it worse
0.02%:  none of that was conf
0.02%:  I was keeping that from
0.02%:  I know that if I paint
0.06%:  I know that if I paint again
0.02%:  I spent an entire month making it
0.02%:  that it'
0.02%:  I'm mention
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint at
0.02%:  I can't promise when
0.02%:  I think it's time to re
0.02%:  I can't promise what
0.02%:  I'm the painter
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret in
0.02%:  that was a joke for
0.02%:  I think I can't promise
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint a new one after this.

0.02%:  I think I'm a great
0.02%:  I'm certain that I knew
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that into
0.02%:  I think one reason
0.02%:  coming to
0.02%:  for a
0.08%:  for a moment
0.03%:  for a moment I was
0.02%:  when I paint again it's not
0.02%:  I can't imagine a point
0.08%:  I can't imagine a point where
0.02%:  we're on the same
0.02%:  actions
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna write a note
0.02%:  I can't stop the
0.02%:  I'm gonna make it a
0.11%:  I'm gonna make it a secret
0.07%:  I'm gonna make it a secret now
0.02%:  that means I'm in a
0.02%:  I was the one making it
0.02%:  now I'm speaking too
0.02%:  none of this came from
0.02%:  speaking of ninja action
0.02%:  once again I'm the reason we

0.02%:  we can't mention that in
0.02%:  none of them
0.04%:  none of them were
0.02%:  I'm at the age
0.02%:  I'm not a painter. I think
0.02%:  we're gonna keep it at that.
0.02%:  I was a jerk then
0.02%:  I'm wearing his face

0.02%:  from that point on it
0.02%:  I know it isn

0.02%:  that's not an image I can
0.02%:  I'm not gonna mention it was a
0.02%:  a few months after
0.02%:  the reason I want to keep
0.02%:  I promise I won't make conf
0.02%:  it's that
0.03%:  it's that conf
0.02%:  it's gonna take more than ancient

0.02%:  we're making the
0.02%:  I want to stop
0.02%:  I think I ate paint
0.02%:  it's now time
0.02%:  I'm coming off as a jerk
0.02%:  at this moment in

0.02%:  part of that
0.02%:  that meant
0.02%:  I paint from

0.02%:  then I was making
0.02%:  if it'
0.02%:  I think I want to paint some more in

0.02%:  I think it's gonna remain a conf
0.02%:  I can't swear I
0.02%:  I think I'm was
0.02%:  now I'm gonna paint the entire
0.02%:  at this point we can agree I
0.02%:  at this point we can agree I'm not
0.02%:  I know it matters
0.02%:  I can't forget to mention his
0.02%:  that isn't making
0.02%:  I think I'm wearing someone
0.02%:  I'm nothing if not frank
0.02%:  then I took
0.02%:  now I'm not so certain the
0.02%:  we're not gonna paint
0.02%:  I was joking.
0.02%:  part of that conf
0.02%:  part of me wants to make
0.02%:  I'm not a fan of keeping
0.02%:  I think if we're gonna paint
0.02%:  I'm not fifteen

0.02%:  the main reason I'm not an
0.02%:  I think I wanna get some
0.04%:  I think I wanna get some paint
0.02%:  I spent more time on that
0.02%:  now I'm thank

0.02%:  on a
0.02%:  now I'm speaking in fiction
0.02%:  I'm certain none of that was an
0.02%:  some part
0.02%:  I know that since I'm not
0.02%:  we're taking that one
0.02%:  I think we're seeing
0.02%:  we're not keeping that conf
0.02%:  I can't imagine what I meant in
0.02%:  now it's time for nap
0.02%:  none of that means I'm wrong in
0.02%:  that makes two confirm
0.02%:  I won't paint again for ten
0.02%:  I think I am now certain
0.02%:  I'm so certain I
0.02%:  I forgot his name. I
0.02%:  it was the ninja one

0.02%:  at this point we're gonna
0.02%:  I am aware of the fact
0.02%:  I'm not certain if it was one of the main
0.02%:  I won't take that
0.02%:  I know it's canon that
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint worse
0.02%:  I think it's time for me to face an
0.02%:  I promise I'm not j

0.02%:  that was me confirm
0.02%:  I can't imagine who I
0.02%:  I know it's not a great an
0.02%:  now I can't imagine him
0.02%:  I'm gonna keep those
0.02%:  we're gonna skip the
0.02%:  I am not 
0.02%:  it was me on
0.02%:  I'm not certain the point
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna paint som
0.02%:  I'm not gonna promise that it
0.02%:  the reason I went on
0.02%:  I forgot the paint was
0.02%:  I'm not certain that if someone
0.02%:  I'm awake
0.02%:  I'm awake right
0.02%:  he's got
0.02%:  I am not a painter now
0.02%:  I think I'm facing a
0.02%:  I meant to paint it when

0.02%:  now I cannot
0.02%:  I think I'm gonna frame it so
0.02%:  that's one giant
0.03%:  that's one giant conf
0.02%:  we can ignore the
0.02%:  it was in the form of an
0.02%:  now I'm off to change
0.02%:  that's on camera
0.02%:  I'm not waiting for him
0.02%:  I'm sort of fine

0.02%:  it's gonna take more time
0.25%:  it's gonna take more time than I can
0.02%:  I was hoping none
0.02%:  part of me thinks I can
0.03%:  part of me thinks I can't imagine
0.02%:  I know it's not fair to name
0.02%:  I know none of that means I'm a
0.02%:  I think I meant to compare
0.02%:  I'm speaking of him
0.02%:  that's making me wanna
0.02%:  at some point in there
0.02%:  if we're gonna make
0.02%:  if we're gonna make this
0.02%:  I know for a fact I meant it in

0.03%:  ninjas are
0.02%:  I promise I won't mention it if he
0.02%:  since I'm a grown
0.02%:  the main point remains
0.02%:  it was the 
0.02%:  I think we're in a
0.02%:  I know that isn't canon
0.02%:  I promise I won't make that again
0.02%:  now I'm certain things
0.02%:  it was on the front of an ice
0.02%:  now I can't shake
0.02%:  that means I'm now 
0.02%:  that was gonna
0.02%:  I can promise I won't make the
0.02%:  I'm now making the
0.02%:  since I'm on a
0.02%:  that's me wanting
0.02%:  in that one
0.02%:  in that one moment
0.02%:  I once wrote a fan

0.02%:  I was meaning to mention that if
0.02%:  it took me 
0.02%:  now that I mention it I see
0.02%:  I think it's gone now
0.02%:  I promise I won't think
0.02%:  if I'm wrong then it
0.02%:  I imagine that I
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint now
0.02%:  I think I want to go to
0.02%:  now I can neither
0.02%:  one time I threw a paint

0.02%:  if I was making that conf
0.01%:  that's a warning
0.01%:  I think I'm certain of it now
0.01%:  I think if I go
0.01%:  I was ten for a
0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing this
0.01%:  that means I'm in for
0.01%:  none of that means I can't paint if
0.01%:  I saw him
0.01%:  there I am making
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a con
0.01%:  now I'm naming parts

0.01%:  if I was gonna paint a
0.01%:  it was ninja paint
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep this fact
0.01%:  at some point when

0.01%:  that one's for
0.01%:  that one's coming from an
0.01%:  I am now certain he
0.01%:  after we
0.01%:  I'm not certain what I imagine
0.01%:  I promise I won't fake
0.01%:  there was a ninja on top
0.01%:  it was after I got
0.01%:  since then I'm
0.01%:  I know there's no point at
0.01%:  once again it's time for me to paint
0.01%:  I know I'm that
0.01%:  that's not gonna make it
0.01%:  now I can't stop the
0.01%:  that one came from a

0.01%:  I'm gonna take this from
0.01%:  in some
0.01%:  now I'm speaking in mon
0.01%:  I know that's not a crime in
0.01%:  I'm sort of a
0.01%:  that was one giant
0.01%:  then one
0.03%:  then one time I was
0.01%:  I think I'm writing too

0.01%:  now I'm facing the first
0.01%:  I know I might
0.01%:  we're gonna keep this a
0.01%:  I'm not smart
0.01%:  to make it worse I
0.01%:  that's fine. I
0.01%:  that means I win for
0.01%:  am I the
0.01%:  I can't paint so
0.01%:  two

0.01%:  I'm not racing to paint
0.01%:  I wanna paint more times
0.01%:  I think I'm coming into a
0.01%:  I mean that one

0.01%:  on that note it
0.01%:  now I see the

0.01%:  I mean the cartoon one. I mean
0.01%:  the frame

0.01%:  if I was gonna paint another
0.01%:  when I paint in
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a few conf
0.01%:  I know I spent more than a

0.01%:  it was on a gre
0.01%:  I mean it in the sinc
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint another time

0.01%:  I was gonna keep that one from
0.01%:  I can't imagine a worse met
0.01%:  if we're keeping it honest
0.01%:  I think at some point it
0.01%:  I keep meaning to re

0.01%:  I know that came
0.01%:  I think I'm time
0.01%:  no I won
0.01%:  no I won't confirm
0.01%:  now I'm hoping I can

0.01%:  I'm not a painter of things
0.01%:  the time I
0.01%:  the time I spent
0.01%:  the time I spent writing
0.01%:  I think if I can't get
0.01%:  I took the paint
0.01%:  I know it from
0.01%:  at the risk of coming
0.01%:  now I think it's too
0.01%:  I think we can agree on one point at
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention if I was the
0.01%:  I can't imagine a paint
0.01%:  I'm not so certain if
0.01%:  we're keeping that in
0.01%:  from now on I'm keeping that fact in

0.01%:  to make things we
0.01%:  I knew it then
0.01%:  at that point we'
0.01%:  I'm certain I now
0.01%:  I am most certain he

0.01%:  I now think
0.01%:  then I was a painter
0.01%:  that time we
0.01%:  on that note I'm opening a new art
0.01%:  I know that a painter
0.01%:  I can name the
0.01%:  now I'm open
0.01%:  that one's from a
0.01%:  I can't imagine how far
0.01%:  I'm the one wearing a
0.01%:  I meant a
0.01%:  it was him
0.01%:  I am the first
0.01%:  I promise I won't make it a conf
0.01%:  I know that if someone can
0.03%:  I know that if someone can paint
0.01%:  that's for me
0.01%:  now I'm making the entire point
0.01%:  I'm certain I know it
0.01%:  now that I come
0.01%:  I think we can agree it's no
0.01%:  I won't mention that in
0.01%:  I'm making one
0.01%:  now I'm gonna make another
0.01%:  none of that was a joke in
0.01%:  I mean to paint again when
0.01%:  now it's time for me to face the pain
0.01%:  that marks
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna write a one
0.01%:  I am now at peace.
0.01%:  I'm now not
0.01%:  I'm now not certain
0.01%:  now the paint's on
0.01%:  I'm gonna remain
0.01%:  that's coming off
0.01%:  I keep meaning to mention I
0.01%:  I'm keeping that as an
0.01%:  I was eating a pe
0.01%:  I think it was in green
0.01%:  now it's one
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint it the
0.01%:  we're picking this
0.01%:  I know I'm not meeting
0.01%:  in a moment of intense
0.01%:  that was part
0.01%:  we're not taking this one
0.01%:  we're on again
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of them
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of him
0.01%:  on that note I'm gonna re
0.01%:  one more thing I wanna mention
0.01%:  it was a thank
0.01%:  I can see it in front
0.03%:  I can see it in front of me now
0.01%:  I can see it in front of me.
0.01%:  I can see it in front of me now.
0.01%:  now I'm off to paint him again.
0.01%:  now I'm making it the
0.01%:  now I'm certain that keeping
0.01%:  I'm now speaking from
0.01%:  I am at
0.01%:  I am at peace knowing
0.01%:  now I'm an honest painter again
0.01%:  I think it went for
0.01%:  I'm not certain when I paint
0.02%:  I'm not certain when I paint again
0.01%:  if we can'
0.02%:  if we can't agree
0.04%:  if we can't agree on that
0.01%:  if we can't agree that
0.01%:  if we can't agree on the
0.01%:  now I'm making the rest of it
0.01%:  once again I think it's time for a new name
0.01%:  now I sorta
0.01%:  we're not gonna mention his name.
0.01%:  I think it's time for tea
0.01%:  at this point I can't make
0.01%:  no I'm not certain that I
0.01%:  I'm gonna open that
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than a w
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint that.
0.01%:  I'm poor
0.01%:  that fact is
0.01%:  none of these paint
0.01%:  I'm certain nothing makes
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint soon
0.01%:  now I'm eating the paint from
0.01%:  I'm certain that none of it means
0.01%:  I was in a room
0.01%:  that makes it more
0.01%:  I know none of it is
0.01%:  I can't mention him
0.01%:  now I'm certain someone in
0.01%:  I meant to phrase
0.01%:  I forgot I meant
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that secret on
0.01%:  we agree
0.01%:  I was the age I
0.01%:  I can't think of a worse ep
0.01%:  now it's a perfect
0.01%:  it's gonna take me fifteen
0.01%:  that's gonna make for one
0.01%:  it's not that I can
0.01%:  I can't seem to imagine how
0.01%:  it was fine
0.01%:  that one's not fair
0.01%:  at the rate
0.01%:  if I were to paint him again I'm not
0.01%:  I want to see if I can get a
0.01%:  I want to remain a
0.01%:  that was an epic
0.01%:  I can see what I meant
0.01%:  I was in the market
0.01%:  now speaking
0.01%:  that's off
0.01%:  I'm certain that on
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna write some paint
0.01%:  there is a conf
0.01%:  he's on a
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint more now.
0.01%:  I was gonna name it after
0.01%:  on that note I want

0.01%:  not that it
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat the
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat the paint
0.01%:  for that I'm not
0.01%:  it's gonna take more than wine
0.01%:  from now on I'm taking the
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna frame it to
0.01%:  I mean that in an awesome
0.01%:  I'm not certain I want a
0.01%:  now I can't imagine it
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint a scene

0.02%:  I'm gonna paint a scene where
0.01%:  right now I'm in
0.01%:  that we're speaking in
0.01%:  it's gonna take me two
0.01%:  I'm certain I paint
0.01%:  I can't imagine if someone
0.01%:  I can imagine no worse fate than if
0.01%:  I meant to ask him
0.01%:  I'm not forget
0.01%:  I can not promise
0.01%:  now it makes me
0.01%:  I can't point

0.01%:  I'm working in the
0.01%:  I'm working in the past
0.01%:  I can keep
0.01%:  I think I see a
0.01%:  it's not a perfect
0.01%:  I think I'm waiting on
0.01%:  I think it's now time to face

0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that secret if I
0.01%:  the front
0.01%:  in that same conf
0.01%:  now there's no point in me taking
0.01%:  I'm aware nothing
0.01%:  one time I was in

0.01%:  I can see the paint on
0.01%:  I'm now certain I am
0.01%:  I'm know
0.01%:  I know that's proof
0.01%:  I want this off
0.01%:  if we can't agree on that point
0.01%:  to the
0.01%:  I'm now certain that in
0.01%:  as the
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna ret
0.01%:  that's known
0.01%:  that means I won't get
0.01%:  now it makes more
0.01%:  I was eating a cookie
0.01%:  I'm gonna print that one
0.01%:  the reason I kept it
0.01%:  I am not a painter of
0.01%:  at this point we are

0.01%:  then I went into art
0.01%:  now I am certain I'm the
0.01%:  I know I'm facing the
0.01%:  now that it's in
0.01%:  I promise I won't mention again that in
0.01%:  he's a woman
0.01%:  that means we're coming to
0.01%:  I think I'm sorta coming
0.01%:  if it were a
0.01%:  I'm not the sort
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention that if I were
0.01%:  there was a can of paint on
0.01%:  I'm gonna write a note
0.01%:  I'm not making that into
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop at

0.01%:  now I'm off to see
0.01%:  the camera
0.01%:  I'm not taking paint
0.01%:  I can't wait to take
0.01%:  the main reason I can't get

0.01%:  I know that's a giant
0.01%:  I'm now facing the same
0.01%:  now I'm certain again that
0.01%:  since we're not gonna
0.01%:  since we're not gonna mention
0.01%:  since we're not gonna paint
0.01%:  I'm gonna take that opinion
0.01%:  I think it's gonna come off
0.01%:  I'm here to
0.01%:  I think it was after I got
0.01%:  I'm not joking. I
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna stop at
0.01%:  I'm working at
0.01%:  I think someone at
0.01%:  that's it for me knowing
0.01%:  what I mean
0.01%:  none of that means I can't imagine new
0.01%:  it was not meant for
0.01%:  I know I'm one of the first
0.01%:  I'm certain that it was one
0.01%:  I'm most certain nothing
0.01%:  I wrote fan fiction to
0.02%:  I wrote fan fiction to make
0.01%:  I meant to paint in
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep that a secret to
0.01%:  I think from now on I can
0.01%:  I think I was aiming more
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint to
0.01%:  I spent a week on it.
0.01%:  now I'm certain that if I paint
0.01%:  I'm making it easier
0.01%:  there's paint
0.01%:  I'm aware that not
0.01%:  I want to hear no
0.01%:  on that note I can't imagine a worse
0.01%:  that one's more
0.01%:  now it's more than
0.01%:  I want that taken
0.01%:  now I'm p
0.02%:  now I'm patting
0.01%:  pre

0.01%:  I meant to paint them
0.01%:  I meant to paint them wearing
0.01%:  that was a 
0.01%:  I'm not certain I saw
0.01%:  I think I'm certain none
0.01%:  that means I'm writing a
0.01%:  I was keeping that in
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention if he
0.01%:  no I'm not certain it was the
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint on the
0.01%:  I forgot what it means
0.01%:  I'm not certain that one is a
0.01%:  I'm not certain it was the one in
0.01%:  I am not certain that I'
0.01%:  now I'm certain of these
0.01%:  I think I'm in tears now
0.01%:  I'm not too certain he
0.01%:  there's no point in making a nin
0.01%:  I sort of want to keep
0.01%:  I'm writing these
0.01%:  I'm writing these conf

0.01%:  I sent it to him
0.01%:  we can see right
0.01%:  it was crap
0.01%:  that means we're on topic
0.01%:  it took me three
0.01%:  I can now imagine
0.01%:  I'm not certain it was an image
0.01%:  if he'
0.01%:  he was making it
0.01%:  he was making it rain
0.01%:  now I'm certain no one has
0.01%:  I think it comes from a

0.01%:  the reason I'm making a point
0.01%:  I know that I'm not gonna paint

0.01%:  I can see I'm not gonna
0.01%:  I can see I'm not gonna make
0.01%:  now I'm keeping it that
0.01%:  then we're gonna
0.01%:  it was on that one page
0.01%:  I'm most certain that I won
0.01%:  I think it's time for a nap too

0.03%:  if I was to paint again
0.01%:  if I was to paint again I
0.01%:  I'm awesome at it
0.01%:  I'm not certain of the tim
0.01%:  I know for a fact I sp
0.01%:  on that note I imagine
0.01%:  I'm gonna start the
0.01%:  I can't paint things
0.01%:  I'm not gonna win a
0.01%:  that one isn't coming from
0.01%:  it's for

0.01%:  I hope I'm forg
0.01%:  I'm not as certain now
0.01%:  that one time a
0.01%:  I'm gonna make a point of that in

0.01%:  if I were facing
0.01%:  we're a team
0.01%:  we're a team again

0.01%:  I fear it
0.01%:  from this point on I can'
0.03%:  from this point on I can't imagine

0.01%:  that's it for keeping
0.01%:  it's more than 
0.01%:  I am not certain he was
0.01%:  since I know I'm the

0.01%:  at no point in time
0.01%:  now I'm the first to
0.01%:  now I'm staring at him
0.01%:  after nin
0.01%:  it's what
0.01%:  it's what I imagine
0.01%:  I spent an entire night on
0.01%:  I'm not certain it won

0.01%:  I think it is now time for me to face
0.01%:  I think if I were to come
0.01%:  now I'm certain to
0.01%:  make that
0.01%:  the reason I'm gonna keep
0.01%:  in the time
0.02%:  in the time since
0.01%:  I can't imagine it was a
0.01%:  that came from a

0.01%:  he was part of a team
0.01%:  that was a great conf
0.01%:  I'm certain I am speaking in
0.01%:  I'm certain I am speaking in the
0.01%:  here I am again not
0.01%:  I want to frame it
0.01%:  on that note I'm keeping
0.01%:  I'm gonna keep on with
0.01%:  I'm not certain when I stop making
0.01%:  if I was gonna mention
0.01%:  at this point I'm working on
0.01%:  I can't imagine one person who
0.01%:  I kept the name
0.01%:  I forgot I conf
0.01%:  I think it went on to inspire a
0.01%:  I want him to get
0.01%:  I think if we compare
0.01%:  since I'm a man of few
0.01%:  now it's time for me to keep
0.01%:  no I'm not gonna make it
0.01%:  I'm certain it was him
0.01%:  I'm not gonna paint that one
0.01%:  I'm a racist now
0.01%:  I think I wanna go paint it
0.01%:  now I'm certain I am not a
0.01%:  I was one of the mean
0.01%:  I'm writing in the past

0.02%:  I'm aware of none of these
0.01%:  I'm aware of none of that
0.03%:  I'm aware of none of that making
0.01%:  I was hoping if
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna swear off pain
0.01%:  I can name them in
0.01%:  it's coming apart now
0.01%:  I was making that name
0.01%:  here I'm making it
0.01%:  I knew that coming into it.
0.01%:  I think I can't paint again
0.01%:  I'm not raising
0.01%:  I can't think of a great
0.01%:  we're not gonna mention him in
0.01%:  I know ninjas are not
0.01%:  I know that's pat
0.01%:  this comment
0.01%:  I'm not gonna stick with

0.01%:  that's now making
0.01%:  at this point I am making
0.01%:  I'm certain of that opinion
0.01%:  I can't paint it again for
0.01%:  I think we can agree I'm not as
0.01%:  we're making this into

0.01%:  that skin
0.01%:  I think I want some more f

0.01%:  I think I'm gonna enter
0.01%:  now I'm certain I meant to paint a
0.01%:  now I'm naming cities
0.01%:  now I'm naming cities after the
0.01%:  since I'm not a painter I know that
0.01%:  in a few months I'm gonna paint it
0.01%:  I can make the

0.01%:  at one point I think I wrote
0.01%:  once again I want
0.01%:  once again I want to thank
0.01%:  I make no promise that I won't again
0.01%:  I'm asking a
0.01%:  I want another ice
0.01%:  I am certain these
0.01%:  we can agree that in
0.01%:  I knew the secret
0.01%:  that was a joke. I'
0.01%:  that was meant in
0.01%:  I'm not certain I know if this
0.01%:  I can't imagine what in
0.01%:  I'm now speaking met
0.01%:  I sorta wanna

0.01%:  I'm certain the point I
0.01%:  I'm certain the point I was making in
0.01%:  those are not
0.01%:  I am now speaking to
0.01%:  we're coming to an
0.01%:  I think I'm eating some
0.01%:  I wrote it in the
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint the same one now
0.01%:  I am aware of this
0.01%:  I'm certain none of it was in
0.01%:  I'm not a painter so I think
0.01%:  I know that I promise
0.01%:  the ninja part's not
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna spare
0.01%:  I am now comfort

0.01%:  I swear I'm gonna keep
0.01%:  I swear I'm gonna keep that
0.01%:  now I'm sitting at a
0.01%:  that's me I
0.01%:  I'm certain I was making the point
0.01%:  since I'm not a painter then
0.01%:  I know the camera
0.01%:  I was taking pain
0.01%:  I promise I won't get into the
0.01%:  now I think I'm gonna paint a nice
0.01%:  I'm certain none of that is at
0.01%:  I know it's a matter
0.01%:  I can't think of a more po
0.01%:  I wrote a fan fiction in the
0.01%:  I know I'm not gonna paint in
0.01%:  I'm not gonna take that one
0.01%:  it's making me want to paint for
0.01%:  I am not certain how to
0.01%:  I'm certain it was not the one
0.01%:  I meant to write none
0.01%:  there was no face
0.01%:  that was after taking
0.01%:  on that note I'm gonna write a fan
0.01%:  I know I'm not hitting
0.01%:  I can't manage
0.01%:  I was more into it
0.01%:  I was more into it than I'
0.01%:  I think I in
0.01%:  I promise I won't mention acting
0.01%: . I was
0.01%:  now I'm gonna paint more cats
0.01%:  one time I went into
0.01%:  I'm aware this joke
0.01%:  when it comes to making paint
0.01%:  I mean the cartoon. I
0.01%:  I mean the cartoon. I mean
0.01%:  it was in traffic
0.01%:  no matter how I paint it I
0.01%:  no matter how I paint it I can
0.01%:  it's gonna take more paint than we
0.01%:  I'm not picking on
0.01%:  now I'm gonna stop.
0.01%:  again that
0.01%:  I'm not certain that makes a
0.01%:  I think I ate most
0.01%:  I got a few
0.01%:  I keep that secret now
0.01%:  I keep that a secret in
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint a new one so

0.01%:  I know for a fact that I'm opening
0.01%:  we're gonna stop on
0.01%:  now I'm not an artist at
0.01%:  now I'm certain some
0.01%:  there's no point wanting
0.01%:  in fact that
0.01%:  if we can agree on that point
0.01%:  I'm not gonna act
0.01%:  I think I wanna paint one more time to
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I want those
0.01%:  the reason I know I can't paint at
0.01%:  there was a ninja cat in it
0.01%:  I can't see where it

0.01%:  I think I'm in more
0.01%:  there was a ninja.
0.01%:  I'm not working that in

0.01%:  a few other conf
0.01%:  I threw it against

0.01%:  for the past ten
0.01%:  that's a one

0.01%:  more than a few of
0.01%:  that means I'm ancient
0.01%:  that's coming from an anti
0.01%:  I'm making this into a conf
0.01%:  from that point in time on

0.01%:  more than a few times
0.01%:  I can't paint either one again
0.01%:  I went too far in that conf
0.01%:  I know he's not facing
0.01%:  none of this came from a
0.01%:  can we agree that if
0.01%:  too
0.01%:  now I think it's gone

0.01%:  I forgot to paint its
0.01%:  I forgot to paint its face
0.01%:  it was magic

0.01%:  then I was fifteen.
0.01%:  I can't stop making new
0.01%:  there I am coming
0.01%:  I'm certain of it too

0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing that it
0.01%:  it was on a cheap

0.01%:  I think I'm on to a
0.01%:  I think I'm on to a new project
0.01%:  I think I'm on to a new front
0.01%:  time for me to face

0.01%:  I meant to paint it in green
0.01%:  seeing how
0.01%:  I'm at peace knowing that.
0.01%:  I think now is a great

0.01%:  I know it's more of an
0.01%:  I promise I'm not a nin
0.01%:  I know I'm off topic.
0.01%:  I forgot the ninja weapons in
0.01%:  that I'm speaking of
0.01%:  none of it is making me want
0.01%:  I spent time working
0.01%:  I spent time working on that

0.01%:  I think I wrote an
0.01%:  I think it's time for a new ep
0.01%:  I'm most certain I want to keep
0.01%:  when I paint I imagine someone
0.01%:  I'm not asking for him
0.01%:  I'm certain the same
0.01%:  I think I was in art
0.01%:  I keep this fact
0.01%:  that one time I conf
0.01%:  I was gonna make it into an
0.01%:  I can't forget to mention he was pink.
0.01%:  that was me from
0.01%:  I'm certain that not knowing if

0.01%:  I'm not owning it either
0.01%:  I'm one giant
0.01%:  that's gonna wreck

0.01%:  I forgot to paint the ninja face
0.01%:  now I'm certain that if I paint someone
0.01%:  it was a tree
0.01%:  that means I make
0.01%:  now it's time for action
0.01%:  we can agree on the
0.01%:  I can't get either
0.01%:  I'm certain that knowing none
0.01%:  that we're not speaking
0.01%:  I think I'm staring into an
0.01%:  each time I mention it I'
0.01%:  what's not
0.01%:  I'm certain no one wants to paint him
0.01%:  I can't make it worse than

0.01%:  scrap
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna paint it so
0.01%:  I was in charge of n
0.01%:  now I'm not so certain if that
0.01%:  I think I came on
0.01%:  I might want to paint one

0.01%:  it was the fr

0.01%:  if I'm not certain I
0.01%:  it's the ninja one.
0.01%:  I think if I were to go paint

0.01%:  that makes me want to join
0.01%:  as a painter I'm not

0.01%:  I forgot paint is
0.01%:  it's gonna take a moment
0.01%:  I'm not certain if it was of the
0.01%:  to think I was gonna paint a
0.01%:  I meant I was fifteen the
0.01%:  if we can't agree on this
0.01%:  now I can't think of one
0.01%:  I think it's great to
0.01%:  I think at one point it
0.01%:  I know that means I can't go
0.01%:  I know I'm certain someone
0.01%:  that's not a joke I
0.01%:  I chose not
0.01%:  I chose not to paint
0.01%:  I think I paint now
0.01%:  then I won'
0.01%:  then I won't paint
0.10%:  then I won't paint again for
0.01%:  then I won't paint again for a
0.01%:  then I won't paint again.
0.01%:  then I won't paint again for ten
0.01%:  I'm not certain someone with

0.01%:  I'm sorta gonna
0.01%:  we're not gonna make a
0.01%:  now I'm making it so that none
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna start on
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna start on a new piece
0.01%:  I con
0.01%:  the reason I'm not eating paint
0.01%:  I'm not making that face on
0.01%:  that means I'm certain now
0.01%:  it's him again.
0.01%:  I make no secret of that
0.01%:  now I am certain of those
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention what paint
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that great of
0.01%:  since I know I'm not that great of an
0.01%:  I won't repeat that.
0.01%:  I think I'm an awesome painter if it
0.01%:  now I'm speaking of the cart
0.01%:  now the joke's on
0.01%:  I'm working that one
0.01%:  most of the time I paint
0.01%:  I know for a fact it's the one in
0.01%:  I'm wearing his face paint
0.01%:  then I wrote fan fiction on
0.01%:  now I think I'm insane
0.01%:  I think one reason I want
0.01%:  I think if I went into
0.01%:  that is me in
0.01%:  I think I'm eating it
0.01%:  I think I'm eating it now
0.01%:  I think if I can paint someone
0.01%:  if I'm not that
0.01%:  I can't imagine a painter of
0.01%:  I'm gonna write that scene in
0.01%:  I am now speaking met
0.01%:  now's the perfect
0.01%:  that's a non
0.01%:  there it is again. I cannot
0.01%:  we're opening a
0.01%:  we're opening a can
0.01%:  I meant it to come
0.01%:  I see no point in making that fact
0.01%:  the green
0.01%:  the green one was
0.01%:  I think I'm ne
0.01%:  I know one person
0.01%:  I'm not gonna fake
0.01%:  I'm not taking these conf
0.01%:  I meant to paint him facing front
0.01%:  I'm the first one on
0.01%:  I swear I'm not joking at
0.01%:  that's not pain
0.01%:  none of that was coming
0.01%:  the main reason I came into
0.01%:  I know I'm gonna paint it some
0.01%:  I know it's not fiction
0.01%:  I want to take a moment here
0.01%:  I got that paint from
0.01%:  coming into
0.01%:  that one makes perfect
0.01%:  that works in
0.01%:  I am now in tears of
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I was making the point
0.01%:  I know the secret name
0.01%:  can'
0.01%:  can't imagine
0.01%:  can't promise
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop now. I
0.01%:  I'm gonna stop now. I think
0.01%:  I'm not certain I got his
0.01%:  I'm not certain I got his name
0.01%:  I'm not making the point
0.01%:  I can paint it again now
0.01%:  now it's time for the main
0.01%:  I think it was a t
0.01%:  I know more than I can
0.01%:  I know I'm not gonna paint it either
0.01%:  the perfect
0.01%:  it was the opening
0.01%:  now I can't think of it
0.01%:  that time I'm gonna
0.01%:  I'm not certain if I mean it as a joke
0.01%:  I'm certain that if I go
0.01%:  if we can agree that'
0.01%:  I'm not certain if pain
0.01%:  I wish none
0.01%:  when I paint on
0.01%:  I think from now on I am
0.01%:  I can't imagine a more poet
0.01%:  the main reason I'm 
0.01%:  I want to see him paint again
0.01%:  I was meaning to mention there
0.01%:  none of that makes me a painter
0.01%:  the awesome
0.01%:  I know I spent an
0.02%:  I know I spent an entire
0.01%:  I know I spent an entire night
0.01%:  for the past nine

0.01%:  the reason I can make
0.01%:  that one's gonna keep
0.01%:  now I can't imagine either
0.01%:  if I'm gonna make conf
0.01%:  since I'm not a time
0.01%:  I know that's not an ego trip
0.01%:  I'm not certain if the image
0.01%:  I know it changes
0.01%:  I'm gonna paint me
0.02%:  I'm gonna paint me another
0.01%:  I'm gonna reach
0.01%:  I think it's time for a new canon
0.01%:  I'm certain the one
0.01%:  I know that name means
0.01%:  it was the one time I'
0.01%:  that means I'm certain it
0.01%:  when I paint again in
0.01%:  if I paint that
0.01%:  if I paint that again
0.01%:  I think I'm not gonna paint since
0.01%:  now there's an image of

0.01%:  I'm gonna frame this in
0.01%:  I can't imagine the answer
0.01%:  that is fine
0.01%:  now the entire point
0.01%:  I think someone can paint a
0.01%:  I was a time
0.01%:  I think if I start
0.01%:  I know that's an entire conf
0.01%:  I'm certain that in a

0.01%:  I'm writing them
0.01%:  now I imagine that'
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna water
0.01%:  I'm writing a one
0.01%:  we can see that I
0.01%:  no matter what I can
0.01%:  no matter what I can't imagine
0.01%:  no matter what I can't seem
0.01%:  each time I mention it I want
0.01%:  I was certain of it
0.01%:  I can't imagine that it
0.01%:  the reason I know I can't paint it
0.01%:  I know that if it
0.01%:  I'm gonna step on a

0.01%:  that '
0.01%:  if I were a paint
0.01%:  I can promise that I won't mention again
0.01%:  a horse.
0.01%:  I'm working on those
0.01%:  when I paint I often imagine someone
0.01%:  I can't forget to mention him
0.01%:  I want to get it
0.01%:  if that makes me a nin
0.01%:  it was in an orange
0.01%:  I'm gonna ask for a
0.01%:  at this moment I know
0.01%:  I think I gotta paint more if
0.01%:  we're not gonna make it in
0.01%:  we're not gonna make it in the
0.01%:  that one was fifteen
0.01%:  I'm not a patient

0.01%:  if I can't keep this
0.01%:  if I'm not making that conf
0.01%:  I think I once wrote a fan
0.01%:  there was a ninja cop
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention the rest
0.01%:  I'm gonna ask him to paint for
0.01%:  I think I wanna paint more of
0.01%:  it's not for
0.01%:  I know it's a ninja thing
0.01%:  I am most certain we
0.01%:  we're past fifteen
0.01%:  if I'm the
0.01%:  it makes me wanna go
0.01%:  I won't paint again in case the
0.01%:  repeat
0.01%:  I meant to pick
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna want to remain
0.01%:  I am making conf
0.01%:  I'm now making the case
0.01%:  I'm making this part of

0.01%:  now I'm racist
0.01%:  now I got tears
0.01%:  it was after the one
0.01%:  I'm gonna step on it now
0.01%:  once again I was
0.01%:  I think if I promise not
0.01%:  I'm now certain that speaking in
0.01%:  it was more than one time
0.01%:  that was one entire
0.01%:  that was one entire conf
0.01%:  I swear I'm keeping
0.01%:  I swear I'm keeping that
0.01%:  once again I ask
0.01%:  I think it's nice of
0.01%:  he was ninja too
0.01%:  no matter how I spin it none
0.01%:  I think it's time for ap
0.01%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint another time
0.01%:  I knew that meant it
0.01%:  now I'm taking another
0.01%:  I know that no painter since
0.01%:  I think if I'm gonna start
0.01%:  I can't imagine a point where it
0.01%:  that means I can't imagine I
0.01%:  I know for a fact I meant it in a
0.01%:  now I'm shaking in fear of

0.01%:  that's in front
0.01%:  that's in front of me
0.01%:  I'm not gonna mention this fact

0.01%:  after I paint I eat
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna warn
0.01%:  I think I want to eat some ice
0.01%:  I am aware that if

0.01%:  I'm not gonna tear
0.01%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint him now.
0.01%:  it was at a camp
0.01%:  there's no point in making a met
0.01%:  I keep that image in front
0.01%:  I think it's a great name
0.01%:  I am not certain when I'
0.01%:  that one fact is
0.01%:  I think part of me is a
0.01%:  I was ten again at

0.00%:  I'm not in a great
0.00%:  I think it's eating
0.00%:  we're speaking in a
0.00%:  since I'm not gonna paint it
0.00%:  there's no point in making me wait
0.00%:  I promise I won't name that one

0.00%:  I'm aware this an
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than one ice
0.00%:  now I'm making another one
0.00%:  I'm certain the joke is

0.00%:  I'm not certain if making this
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a few times after
0.00%:  I'm certain that I know some
0.00%:  there's no point making it a
0.00%:  if that isn't e
0.00%:  I think I can paint some more
0.00%:  I mean it in the generic
0.00%:  there's a tape of me making

0.00%:  I know that's not part
0.00%:  I was gonna mention it'
0.00%:  time to paint another
0.00%:  on that note I rest
0.00%:  at this rate I'm gonna keep
0.00%:  that means I'm a perfect
0.00%:  if I'm gonna paint more
0.00%:  I can't imagine a point when
0.00%:  I forgot that it
0.00%:  if I were to paint an image

0.01%:  I think I'm certain no one wants
0.00%:  it's him again in
0.00%:  each time I paint I get worse
0.00%:  on that note I'm taking a rain
0.00%:  I think I spent a few too
0.00%:  I'm certain I meant it as a joke.
0.00%:  I think we can start
0.00%:  I think I was certain
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it secret that
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna tear
0.00%:  part of me can't imagine that
0.00%:  I'm not the point

0.00%:  on this topic
0.00%:  that means I remain
0.00%:  that's one area
0.00%:  I mention that to make
0.00%:  now I think I'm certain it
0.00%:  now I'm making the point of
0.00%:  I was hoping to create
0.00%:  it's taken me an entire

0.00%:  I can't paint so great now
0.00%:  I am now free

0.00%:  nothing since
0.00%:  I was the one making it into

0.00%:  I forgot the point I
0.00%:  I know I'm the one raising
0.00%:  if I were to paint that same image
0.00%:  I'm not certain the image in
0.00%:  I can stop here

0.00%:  here I was making an
0.00%:  I know there's a paint
0.00%:  not to make

0.00%:  I know I'm the first one in
0.00%:  I know for a fact I meant the one in
0.00%:  now it's ten again
0.00%:  I'm not certain if what I meant

0.00%:  if I paint it again I can
0.00%:  there is not
0.00%:  I forgot I meant to paint
0.00%:  I can promise that if we
0.00%:  the main reason I'm not picking
0.00%:  it's more than one
0.00%:  that was coming from one
0.00%:  that one I meant
0.00%:  we're making that a
0.00%:  we're speaking in fiction
0.00%:  I'm working on that one.
0.00%:  I am certain no one is
0.00%:  I'm making no con
0.00%:  tonight'
0.00%:  I want to make the point
0.00%:  that's coming from an e

0.00%:  I see no point in taking
0.00%:  I can't think of a worse paint name
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint the rest
0.00%:  I was in the prime
0.00%:  I'm certain that I owe
0.00%:  I'm too far
0.00%:  I can't imagine if he
0.00%:  now I'm facing the fear
0.00%:  he was cart
0.00%:  if I were to paint tonight
0.00%:  now I can imagine the rest
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention that scene
0.00%:  I think it's now time for me to face a
0.00%:  I'm certain that image
0.00%:  I'm not a great paint
0.00%:  I'm st
0.00%:  I know I'm tiring
0.00%:  I was meaning to mention that piece
0.00%:  it's gonna take me for
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was fifteen
0.00%:  right now I'm off
0.01%:  right now I'm off to paint
0.00%:  I'm certain that means it
0.00%:  that means I'm nine for

0.00%:  I'm wearing pants.
0.00%:  I think it was on a green
0.01%:  I think it was on a green piece
0.00%:  I'm gonna take it home now
0.00%:  I think time for some
0.00%:  he was coming from
0.00%:  I'm gonna own that secret
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can think
0.00%:  I want to paint more so I can
0.00%:  on the topic of making
0.00%:  I meant the first point
0.00%:  I'm certain someone with a
0.00%:  now I'm gonna make it into a cart
0.00%:  I know he's not a painter of
0.00%:  one of them was an
0.00%:  that's me project
0.00%:  I know it's not a giant
0.00%:  I know this after

0.00%:  I can't speak for him
0.00%:  that's a known
0.00%:  her name's not
0.00%:  I think I paint too
0.00%:  I think we can agree I'm not too

0.00%:  if I'm making another
0.00%:  I saw it on a
0.00%:  none of that was a joke at
0.00%:  now I'm making that first
0.00%:  I'm at peace knowing that some
0.00%:  I promise I won't fight
0.00%:  I think if someone went
0.00%:  now I'm not speaking from the
0.00%:  I can't promise I meant the
0.00%:  a cartoon.
0.00%:  that for
0.00%:  I'm keeping it in the frame
0.00%:  I'm not a great think
0.00%:  I am not the painter I once
0.00%:  I'm certain the image is
0.00%:  I ate the paint after.
0.00%:  I'm the one making conf
0.00%:  I'm not waiting for some
0.00%:  now I'm keeping that fact
0.00%:  what I'm gonna paint
0.00%:  we can keep that on
0.00%:  I can't manage to make
0.00%:  that's not proof
0.00%:  I know he's coming for

0.00%:  I know I can't paint a more
0.00%:  I'm casting no

0.00%:  there was no cake
0.00%:  I'm not more
0.00%:  I'm the one asking for paint
0.00%:  now that's taken care of I
0.00%:  one time I spent an
0.00%:  I am not an artist
0.00%:  I was one of the more
0.00%:  I'm not whisper
0.00%:  I think once again we see
0.00%:  I know I pe
0.00%:  that's me coming in
0.00%:  at that point I was making
0.00%:  that one is now
0.00%:  I'm certain I was making an
0.00%:  at this point if
0.00%:  at this point if I were
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint from
0.00%:  since I'm not an art
0.00%:  I meant that in a sinc
0.00%:  none of them are mine

0.00%:  it was a piece I
0.00%:  I promise that I won't make a
0.00%:  I think I can own
0.00%:  I know it's not paint
0.00%:  I wanna keep that secret if
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint it a

0.00%:  I can't swear on a
0.00%:  I think me
0.00%:  I'm not picking a winner
0.00%:  I think I'm wrong to
0.00%:  now I'm naming these
0.00%:  one time I won
0.01%:  one time I won a contest
0.00%:  it's time for me to take a nap in
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm insane
0.00%:  I'm gonna pick that one
0.00%:  it was of the green
0.00%:  now I'm gonna open the
0.00%:  I knew that someone
0.00%:  one of his
0.00%:  I think i'm gonna paint some
0.00%:  nice
0.01%:  nice knowing
0.00%:  the reason I'm a man
0.00%:  the reason I'm a man of few
0.00%:  I promise not to make it an
0.00%:  that one is not

0.00%:  now I'm gonna eat more
0.01%:  now I'm gonna eat more chips
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to them
0.00%:  it's gonna take a few more than nine
0.00%:  come to think of it I was nine. I
0.00%:  it's not a great conf
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm gonna
0.00%:  on that note I'm opening a new can
0.00%:  more than 
0.00%:  he's wearing a pink cam
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few me
0.00%:  that met
0.00%:  that means I'm an e
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that now I
0.00%:  now I'm someone
0.00%:  I keep an
0.00%:  it's mic
0.00%:  I can't imagine a worse time in
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to go nap in an
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it the same now
0.00%:  when I mention it to
0.00%:  I know this not from
0.00%:  now I can't imagine a more intense
0.00%:  I know the point
0.00%:  I know it's that one.
0.00%:  no point in making
0.01%:  no point in making that conf
0.00%:  I think I want to paint again since
0.00%:  I'm not certain if some
0.00%:  I'm poor at making
0.00%:  the reason I'm now an
0.00%: aa
0.00%:  there's ninja action

0.00%:  I was meaning the painter
0.00%:  I knew it at
0.01%:  I knew it at the time.
0.00%:  from now on I'm keeping this fact a
0.00%:  I'm certain that at no
0.00%:  at one point I might
0.00%:  it was a frame
0.00%:  that means I'm not a painter if we
0.00%:  I think I won some
0.00%:  that was in one
0.00%:  so now I'm certain
0.00%:  that's coming in at
0.00%:  I think I mean to paint again.
0.00%:  since I'm imag
0.00%:  now I am certain that I'm not speaking in

0.00%:  on that note we're gonna paint
0.00%:  I wanna paint more often so
0.00%:  then I was in art
0.00%:  I think it's gone now.

0.00%:  it cost
0.00%:  I'm now sitting in front of an
0.00%:  I can promise I won't name
0.00%:  now I'm forcing the met
0.00%:  I think we spent a
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna reach
0.00%:  now I am certain I am a
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that a conf
0.00%:  now it's not the
0.00%:  I know it's fifteen

0.00%:  I can't imagine what kept
0.00%:  some of that conf
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to gain
0.00%:  it was an attempt
0.00%:  I know that's not nice
0.00%:  I was the painter in
0.00%:  I was either making a conf
0.00%:  if I were to name him
0.00%:  I am not seeking
0.00%:  I'm certain of the meaning
0.00%:  it was not me
0.00%:  I was making it into a conf
0.00%:  now it's gonna take me another fifteen
0.00%:  I'm not gonna answer to
0.00%:  I think it means I'm gonna
0.00%:  that one is making
0.00%:  it's gonna wreck
0.00%:  after that I took
0.00%:  I'm open to change
0.00%:  now I'm taking the rest
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint him for
0.00%:  I know I'm not certain if that
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that face
0.00%:  I am not certain if he
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint one
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint one more
0.00%:  when I'm making

0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint faster now
0.00%:  now that's not coming
0.00%:  now I'm most certain of it.
0.00%:  these are two conf
0.00%:  I can't stop there. I
0.00%:  now I'm posting on

0.00%:  it was a remake of the
0.00%:  I'm hoping someone can
0.00%:  it might take
0.00%:  after that I went in
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it another
0.00%:  we're making him
0.00%:  it's an image of
0.00%:  part of this
0.01%:  part of this conf
0.00%:  I'm not gonna stop it either
0.00%:  I think I want to paint some again

0.00%:  I'm not picking it
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna eat some paint now.

0.00%:  it was an image I
0.00%:  I'm a ske
0.01%:  I'm a skeptic when

0.00%:  I'm not naming it
0.01%:  I'm not naming it after
0.00%:  I think it's time to go craw
0.00%:  it was an ap

0.00%:  if I spent
0.00%:  I'm aware that once
0.00%:  I was nine there
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna wait at

0.00%:  I was gonna conf
0.00%:  that's if
0.00%:  I got one star
0.00%:  I was at the cinema
0.00%:  in case I'm making it
0.00%:  I'm gonna rest

0.00%:  if I were to make a conf
0.00%:  that's not a warning
0.00%:  I promise I can't make

0.01%:  I'm certain I meant none of it as a joke
0.00%:  I think it was facing
0.00%:  I know I spent more time eating
0.00%:  I'm speaking in front of a non
0.00%:  I meant the painter.
0.00%:  I can't paint him wearing

0.00%:  I know it's not a great piece
0.00%:  now I'm gonna eat this paint
0.00%:  I think it's a giant
0.00%:  when I imagine a master
0.00%:  I want to paint things more
0.00%:  the main reason I keep mention
0.00%:  I am aware those
0.00%:  that was one point for
0.00%:  no matter who I am speaking
0.00%:  on top of that I
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint more than two

0.00%:  knowing these
0.00%:  I'm certain no one knows the
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint that same
0.00%:  I'm not wearing pants. I think
0.00%:  that was a con
0.00%:  I'm not his
0.00%:  I know that isn't a perfect
0.00%:  I swear I'm not making the conf
0.00%:  new conf
0.00%:  I think I'm coming off as one
0.00%:  I want to keep hearing

0.00%:  that is not me
0.00%:  I think it was more of an ap
0.00%:  I can't wait for the opening

0.00%:  I'm not certain what meaning
0.00%:  if I went to
0.01%:  if I went to prison
0.00%:  come to think of it I'm nin
0.00%:  I think I'm w
0.00%:  I got three

0.00%:  I spit on him after

0.00%:  I make no effort
0.00%:  I know the image of
0.00%:  he's making a peace
0.00%:  I'm certain that at one
0.00%:  I'm perfect at
0.00%:  then I won't paint again for at
0.00%:  I want to make a time
0.00%:  that means I'm writing in
0.00%:  I know I'm coming off as e
0.00%:  I am now pain
0.00%:  I'm not on speaker
0.00%:  knowing the
0.00%:  I can't wait for him to mention
0.00%:  that was meant to confirm
0.00%:  that makes me a 
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write fan fiction one

0.00%:  the main reason I won
0.02%:  the main reason I won't paint
0.00%:  I can't make that promise I
0.00%:  I forgot it was an
0.00%:  it's not the main
0.00%:  in fact I am
0.00%:  I think I ate paint for
0.00%:  I was fifteen at the time. I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint it as often
0.00%:  I'm not gonna open this

0.00%:  since neither
0.00%:  I'm gonna take a shot
0.00%:  I make no mention of this in
0.00%:  if we're gonna name paint then
0.00%:  I'm not one of the main
0.00%:  I think it's canon.
0.00%:  I think I'm major
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna paint this time
0.00%:  now I'm sorta hoping

0.00%:  I'm at work
0.00%:  I can promise I won't mention that in a
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make that face
0.00%:  I know it means

0.00%:  that was me at nine.
0.00%:  there cannot
0.00%:  we're not a
0.00%:  I think I meant to pre

0.00%:  I know that on
0.00%:  I know for a fact I'm not in the same
0.00%:  I'm the first one I
0.00%:  now I'm making certain that
0.00%:  I'm certain the mention
0.00%:  I'm certain it was fifteen
0.00%:  that's a major
0.00%:  I'm not writing that in

0.00%:  I want to paint more things.
0.00%:  the reason I'm now 
0.00%:  I'm not certain how to get
0.00%:  I think it was a generic
0.00%:  I'm gonna print this one on
0.00%:  if we're making that
0.00%:  if we're making that conf
0.00%:  that's it from me.
0.00%:  I'm scar
0.00%:  now he can't paint again
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna come
0.00%:  if I were to paint it again then
0.00%:  I'm gonna make this a conf
0.00%:  it was a magic
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint me

0.00%:  I'm not certain the point was
0.00%:  I am making a conf

0.00%:  that one.
0.00%:  I think I wrote a song
0.00%:  I was gonna paint the t
0.00%:  that makes one point
0.00%:  I can see from the
0.00%:  I'm hoping it was
0.00%:  that joke was meant
0.00%:  now that I'm a teen again I
0.00%:  I think it's proof
0.00%:  I won't repeat the mistake again.

0.00%:  I think if I paint again one
0.00%:  that's not me in front
0.00%:  from that point in time I
0.00%:  we take
0.00%:  I know that's a major
0.00%:  I'm keeping that ninja secret to
0.00%:  I can promise nothing of
0.00%:  there's a ninja eating
0.00%:  that's it for ancient
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that fiction in
0.00%:  I think it's time to face one

0.00%:  if we're gonna make a
0.00%:  I can take that
0.00%:  I hope I'm not making a conf

0.00%:  I know the paint's gonna
0.01%:  I know the paint's gonna come
0.00%:  when it comes to making an
0.00%:  now I'm making the artist

0.00%:  I imagine that won
0.00%:  I imagine that won't make
0.00%:  I forgot a com
0.00%:  if I were to paint a scene of the
0.00%:  I can't imagine a more pit
0.00%:  I know that's fr
0.00%:  that was not meant for
0.00%:  since I'm not a painter I am
0.00%:  I think I got to paint
0.00%:  I keep that secret to
0.00%:  I mean the cartoon again

0.00%:  we're past ten
0.00%:  now I can't mention the
0.00%:  we're in a safe
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna tear off
0.00%:  I was taking the paint from
0.00%:  on a more
0.00%:  it's gonna take 
0.00%:  I think it's coming time to

0.00%:  none of that's making me re
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that was
0.00%:  I can't mention his
0.01%:  I can't mention his name in
0.03%:  I can't mention his name in front
0.01%:  I can't mention his name in front of a
0.01%:  I can't mention his name for
0.00%:  in that one case
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make another paint
0.00%:  I'm eating an
0.02%:  I'm eating an entire
0.01%:  I'm eating an entire cake
0.00%:  I'm eating an ice
0.00%:  it's gonna take a new
0.00%:  there's no point in meeting
0.00%:  now I'm certain that not one
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new name. I
0.00%:  I'm making it worse. I
0.00%:  now I'm not certain that one
0.00%:  then I ate it for
0.00%:  now I'm a perfect
0.00%:  one of them was pink
0.00%:  so now I'm certain that
0.00%:  for an
0.00%:  that means I win in
0.00%:  I was an e
0.00%:  I think I won't go into art
0.00%:  I forgot to take a
0.00%:  now is the point
0.00%:  since I'm not a painter with
0.00%:  I'm not gonna see what
0.00%:  I promise I won't name the one
0.00%:  I am not a painter now.
0.00%:  I wrote fan fiction to make him
0.00%:  it was the giant
0.00%:  it's now time for the
0.00%:  I'm a machine
0.00%:  I know it's one of them
0.00%:  I can't get past
0.00%:  now I'm rant
0.00%:  I'm certain he knows I
0.00%:  I was gonna thank
0.00%:  that one's 
0.00%:  it's gonna take more paint to
0.00%:  somehow I got
0.00%:  I'm not certain if one of
0.00%:  I think I can get a
0.00%:  I think it's time to craw
0.00%:  if I'm not a painter when
0.00%:  I'm not a painter since then.
0.00%:  I'm not gonna confirm if it
0.01%:  I'm not gonna confirm if it was the
0.00%:  I'm not working in paint
0.00%:  I wore it
0.00%:  I know that's canon.
0.00%:  now I get to paint it
0.00%:  there's a note
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret who
0.00%:  I know I get
0.00%:  it was neon green paint
0.00%:  if I can make it
0.00%:  I'm aware no
0.00%:  I'm aware no one
0.00%:  I am nothing if not an awesome
0.00%:  since I'm gonna paint it
0.00%:  I know I can't imagine a time
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint to
0.00%:  I wash
0.00%:  it was a n
0.00%:  since we're making a
0.00%:  I can't stop making more
0.00%:  I think it was once
0.00%:  no point in asking
0.00%:  no point in asking me to name
0.00%:  now I'm certain that image
0.00%:  there's one conf
0.00%:  that in fact makes
0.00%:  I know at some point that'
0.00%:  that's a fine
0.00%:  here we go.
0.00%:  I can't imagine the present me
0.00%:  here I was making it
0.00%:  on that note I'm raising
0.00%:  I know no painter has
0.00%:  the reason I'm in a
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it more than twice
0.00%:  I'm now making an
0.00%:  I'm now making an effort
0.01%:  I'm now making an effort to paint
0.00%:  since I'm gonna paint another
0.00%:  there I go mention
0.00%:  I'm sinking into the carpet
0.00%:  I think I mean more
0.00%:  none of it is a
0.00%:  that one's from an
0.00%:  that one's from an anime
0.00%:  I think I can't imagine a time
0.00%:  it was re
0.00%:  I meant to paint in water
0.00%:  it's pink
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I was on the
0.00%:  in spite
0.01%:  in spite of that
0.00%:  I meant to paint nin
0.00%:  I keep it there
0.00%:  I was more into him
0.00%:  it might as
0.00%:  that's an ancient joke
0.00%:  now I'm not so e
0.00%:  then I wrote it on a nap
0.00%:  we're gonna paint that scene
0.00%:  I think I'm waiting a
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint a new one.
0.00%:  in case he
0.00%:  I'm certain that was not one
0.00%:  I wrote that in an
0.00%:  I'm not certain I want to name
0.00%:  I promise that I am
0.00%:  I think if we're not gonna
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make either
0.00%:  I was making that nin
0.00%:  fake conf
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one secret if it
0.00%:  I'm gonna make a note to paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna frame it that
0.00%:  I think I got paint on me
0.00%:  I'm certain that making a
0.00%:  I was torn
0.00%:  I was once a
0.00%:  I'm a grown man in case that
0.00%:  it's gonna take me a hot
0.00%:  I can't think of a painter name
0.00%:  I want to paint some more again
0.00%:  I can't see from
0.00%:  I'm not certain what eating
0.00%:  I'm gonna name the painter
0.00%:  I think I'm not awesome for
0.00%:  that one's canon for
0.00%:  if I was taking
0.00%:  I'm not gonna write him a note
0.00%:  I forgot to make him a
0.06%:  I forgot to make him a ninja.
0.06%:  I forgot to make him a ninja t
0.01%:  I forgot to make him a ninja in
0.00%:  now I'm gonna take this project
0.00%:  there comes a point in a
0.00%:  I got that from one
0.00%:  I'm totes gonna paint him now
0.00%:  I was joking that entire
0.00%:  I know it's not the 
0.00%:  if I were to paint again som
0.00%:  I'm setting new front
0.00%:  it is not
0.00%:  I think I'm waiting for one
0.00%:  I meant it in more
0.01%:  I meant it in more than
0.00%:  I promise to make that conf
0.00%:  I'm speaking in the form
0.00%:  I'm speaking in the form of an
0.00%:  I meant to make this a
0.00%:  I think I want to go on a
0.00%:  I know I'm not artist
0.00%:  I think I sn
0.00%:  then we're not
0.00%:  then we're not speaking
0.00%:  that's taking into
0.00%:  can we not make
0.01%:  can we not make this
0.00%:  I won't mention that name
0.01%:  I won't mention that name again.
0.00%:  I won't mention that name again for
0.00%:  I won't mention that name again if
0.00%:  that from
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of the new
0.00%:  now I'm on an
0.00%:  I am not so
0.01%:  I am not so certain
0.00%:  I know that it is
0.00%:  I was making it the centre
0.00%:  I not
0.00%:  I keep that in a
0.02%:  I keep that in a frame
0.01%:  I keep that in a frame in
0.00%:  I'm hoping if
0.00%:  at some point I'm aware
0.00%:  this time I'm gonna paint
0.00%:  then it was time to
0.00%:  I agree that I
0.00%:  I'm the one I was
0.00%:  now in ret
0.00%:  it was of a green
0.00%:  I think I'm smart again
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint it soon.
0.00%:  I think it was an emotion
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention what piece
0.00%:  none of that means I'm certain I won
0.00%:  I think at some point I went a
0.00%:  I know there isn't a nin
0.00%:  from now on if
0.00%:  I promise if we
0.00%:  now I'm making the case to
0.01%:  now I'm making the case to paint
0.00%:  I can't think of a more apt image of
0.00%:  I'm not certain it was on the
0.00%:  it's gonna remain in
0.00%:  I'm taking this project
0.00%:  there was a moment in
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna create a time
0.00%:  I won't paint it again either
0.00%:  the main reason I'm an
0.00%:  I'm speaking of neither
0.00%:  I think I won't see
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of the entire
0.00%:  it's in a frame in
0.00%:  I want to mention in case
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna want to stop
0.00%:  I know that if someone came in
0.00%:  I think we can agree paint
0.00%:  I'm so not making
0.00%:  that's paint
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I want to see him
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I want to see him again
0.00%:  after conf
0.00%:  I keep writing it
0.00%:  if I want to make things more
0.00%:  I got paint in
0.00%:  I'm a grown man that keeps
0.00%:  if I paint another one I get
0.00%:  I think I'm perfect now
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that into an
0.00%:  I think it's time for me now to face
0.00%:  then it's not
0.00%:  I'm aware of some
0.00%:  I'm not the first one to imagine
0.00%:  I mean it as the
0.00%:  I think it's me on
0.00%:  honest
0.00%:  if I was gonna make a conf
0.00%:  now I'm gonna skip the
0.00%:  now the joke's on me again
0.00%:  that means we're on a
0.00%:  I promise I won't cheat again on
0.00%:  I'm the first one to come
0.00%:  now that I'm in tears
0.00%:  I think I spent more time on fig
0.00%:  that's not meaning
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention it in case
0.00%:  at this point I'm mention
0.00%:  it was taken from an image on
0.00%:  now I am taking
0.00%:  now here I am making conf
0.00%:  now I'm gonna shake
0.00%:  I am once again at
0.00%:  he was in front of me.
0.00%:  I think I'm one step from
0.00%:  I think I am more
0.00%:  I was the one acting
0.00%:  I paint the same image
0.00%:  now I'm certain none of that means I
0.00%:  I'm not joking. I was
0.00%:  that means no one
0.00%:  I'm fine knowing this
0.00%:  I know it's a point
0.00%:  I think I was in an
0.00%:  now I'm not eating this
0.00%:  I saw that one
0.01%:  I saw that one coming
0.01%:  I saw that one coming from
0.00%:  thanks to a
0.00%:  thanks to a certain
0.00%:  no I can't see
0.00%:  no I can't see where
0.00%:  it's making me tear
0.00%:  that one's for me
0.00%:  here it comes.
0.00%:  he was on a rock
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint that master
0.00%:  I think if I were to paint again some
0.00%:  I mean it respect
0.00%:  the main reason I keep wanting
0.00%:  I think part of me wants to imagine
0.00%:  I know I'm not that painter
0.00%:  there was an open can
0.00%:  when I imagine it
0.00%:  I knew that as I
0.00%:  action.
0.00%:  I think it comes from an
0.00%:  for once I'm not making an
0.00%:  I'm not asking for peace
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few ep
0.00%:  at this point we're no
0.00%:  now it's time for 
0.00%:  I think I won't paint again to
0.00%:  he's wearing a teen
0.00%:  I'm the one writing a
0.00%:  we're not meant to speak of it again.
0.00%:  since I'm no
0.00%:  I'm on the same
0.01%:  I'm on the same page
0.00%:  that's not a mention
0.00%:  I know that name comes
0.00%:  none of it's gonna matter in the
0.00%:  I know he isn
0.00%:  I wanna paint so
0.00%:  if I was to paint it
0.00%:  now I can't imagine a time in the past or
0.00%:  I'm fine if someone
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make it in the art scene
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new age
0.00%:  I'm waiting on a
0.00%:  I mean in the fiction
0.00%:  it was a major
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep in
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention it if he was.
0.00%:  I was in charge of a paint
0.00%:  now I'm making that into an entire
0.00%:  there's no tape in
0.00%:  I'm certain nothing I paint now
0.00%:  now I'm a person
0.00%:  I'm not certain if knowing those
0.00%:  I know none of it'
0.00%:  the reason I know I can't mention
0.00%:  that's an opening
0.00%:  now I'm not certain if I meant it as a joke.
0.00%:  I owe a
0.00%:  I am aware I am
0.00%:  I meant to write nin
0.00%:  I won't mention this in
0.00%:  I'm wearing his t
0.00%:  I'm gonna treat
0.00%:  here I am taking it
0.00%:  now I'm certain that I speak
0.00%:  I'm not certain the joke was
0.00%:  I think I want to commit se
0.00%:  now I can't take paint
0.00%:  I spent a month on
0.00%:  I'm certain I was gonna paint
0.00%:  I meant to write a joke
0.00%:  I'm seeking
0.00%:  I think a part of me is now
0.00%:  I know I'm a man of action
0.00%:  that time I ran
0.00%:  I'm knowing that I
0.00%:  either I'm an awesome
0.00%:  none of it was a met
0.00%:  none of that's an ap
0.00%:  I'm facing prison time when

0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna eat ice
0.00%:  there was a ninja foot in
0.00%:  I'm aware it takes
0.00%:  I'm in that
0.00%:  I make no mention of this fact
0.00%:  now it's gonna take another fifteen
0.00%:  no it's not coming
0.00%:  I think I can see it in front of me again.
0.00%:  I think I'm sitting on an
0.00%:  no I'm not certain if he was
0.00%:  now it's time to imagine
0.00%:  can we get past
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a winner
0.00%:  I think at some point I wrote an
0.00%:  I think it's time I paint one
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing pants on
0.00%:  I meant to mention it when
0.00%:  I won't repeat it if
0.00%:  I am neither a
0.00%:  now I'm th
0.00%:  it's after I
0.00%:  again I'm not certain if
0.00%:  I know it's the one on
0.00%:  I think I'm certain it was one

0.02%:  I want to remain on speaking
0.01%:  I want to remain on the topic
0.00%:  one time I sp
0.00%:  no one can take that from me.
0.00%:  since I wrote it
0.00%:  I spent more time on the c
0.00%:  none of it makes me wanna
0.01%:  none of it makes me wanna paint right
0.00%:  I'm certain that is an
0.00%:  none of that makes me certain of
0.00%:  I'm keeping that ninja conf
0.00%:  none of it was that great
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write a scene
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna write a scene into
0.00%:  I was gonna frame that piece
0.00%:  on some
0.00%:  I know it's not time for a
0.00%:  now I think I'm fine
0.00%:  no time machine.
0.00%:  that sign
0.00%:  I think I am awesome for
0.00%:  I'm gonna want some
0.00%:  I can't imagine it was the
0.00%:  if I'm not 
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one a secret I
0.00%:  once again we're off
0.00%:  since I'm not a nin
0.00%:  I know it's from a
0.00%:  I can see a few
0.00%:  now I'm certain that at
0.00%:  I can't think of a more anti

0.00%:  we can go on
0.00%:  I can imagine no fewer
0.01%:  I can imagine no fewer than ten
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than penc
0.00%:  now I'm in a state
0.00%:  I'm not taking this in
0.00%:  I keep that framing
0.00%:  I think at some point I grew
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint that on
0.00%:  I think if I paint again we can
0.00%:  that was in a coffee
0.00%:  I gotta paint a new one for the

0.00%:  I think I won't rest
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint that if
0.00%:  I know I'm sitting in a chair
0.00%:  the reason I know I can't get
0.00%:  I want to ask
0.00%:  at the age
0.00%:  it was the main
0.00%:  then I ran into a

0.00%:  I think I'm sitting on a piece
0.00%:  I know he's not a painter I
0.00%:  if I were to paint again I can't think
0.00%:  I'm not into making that
0.00%:  if I paint it now I'm gonna make
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some action

0.00%:  I'm not writing it off
0.00%:  we got a
0.00%:  the main reason I know I'm not a

0.00%:  I get points for that
0.00%:  most of the paint went

0.00%:  that's it for a
0.00%:  I can paint again now if
0.00%:  no matter how I make
0.00%:  I'm not owning that at

0.00%:  I'm certain none of that is gonna win
0.00%:  I'm certain none of that is gonna win me a
0.00%:  I think I can imagine some of
0.00%:  it was meant for me to
0.00%:  we can't go on
0.01%:  we can't go on from
0.00%:  it was in a race
0.00%:  when I paint again I mean
0.00%:  I think none of it matter
0.00%:  the reason I can't get it
0.00%:  I am not certain if it'
0.00%:  I know for a fact that I'm one

0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can frame
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can frame it
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new cat
0.00%:  I wrote fan fiction as
0.01%:  I wrote fan fiction as a teen
0.00%:  that means if I'm a
0.03%:  that means if I'm a painter now
0.01%:  that means if I'm a painter I
0.01%:  that means if I'm a painter now I
0.00%:  that means if I'm a painter in
0.00%:  now I sort of hate
0.00%:  I wrote fan fiction on it
0.00%:  I forgot the name was
0.00%:  I ate it after
0.00%:  neither one is a conf
0.00%:  again I'm the one
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if he
0.04%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint
0.01%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint me
0.01%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint it now
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint it for
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint a
0.00%:  I'm not certain how I kept
0.00%:  I am so aware
0.00%:  I'm making new front
0.00%:  it was in the ancient
0.00%:  I swear I'm not making it into
0.00%:  I'm meaning it when
0.00%:  we're on that again
0.00%:  it was the green one I
0.00%:  I work in an
0.01%:  I work in an office.
0.01%:  I work in an office that
0.00%:  I work in an office that'
0.00%:  I work in an office so
0.00%:  the reason I know it can
0.00%:  I'm at the same point now
0.00%:  since I'm at it I
0.00%:  it was a fine
0.00%:  that means I'm not gonna paint for
0.00%:  the magic
0.00%:  there is no take
0.00%:  I'm not making this point
0.00%:  I forgot to cap
0.00%:  from this point I'm gonna
0.00%:  I think I'm now facing a
0.00%:  I know that scene from
0.00%:  I think if I want to paint someone
0.00%:  after that I kept
0.00%:  from that point I imagine
0.00%:  now I think it's time for an image
0.00%:  I think I'm now at a
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint that image in
0.00%:  I imagine I'm not that
0.00%:  now I'm off the air
0.00%:  if we're making this conf
0.00%:  I'm wearing a pink hat
0.00%:  that I'm not an awesome painter in
0.00%:  I know I meant it in a
0.00%:  then I was more
0.00%:  I'm certain none of this went in
0.00%:  I think if I paint now it
0.01%:  I think if I paint now it's gonna
0.01%:  I think if I paint now it's gonna come
0.00%:  if I was perfect
0.00%:  I'm aware of the sp
0.00%:  I think it's a fair comment
0.00%:  if I paint again som
0.00%:  there I am on
0.00%:  I know that if I'm gonna paint in
0.00%:  nope I'm not certain
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint it in
0.00%:  we're gonna finish it
0.00%:  that was me making one of
0.00%:  not to mention I was a
0.00%:  I'm not certain I paint with
0.00%:  I'm gonna write home to
0.00%:  knowing I
0.00%:  I think I can see in
0.00%:  I want to paint more again.
0.00%:  I'm gonna work that one
0.00%:  I'm certain that no mention
0.00%:  I think it's me I
0.00%:  I spent more on
0.00%:  I was gonna frame it too
0.00%:  I'm not certain I imagine
0.00%:  I know for a fact the paint is
0.00%:  I'm sick now
0.00%:  it's with
0.00%:  I think I want to paint once
0.02%:  I think I want to paint once again
0.01%:  I think I want to paint once more.
0.00%:  I think it's not an
0.00%:  I think as a painter I'm not
0.00%:  I know that means I'm 
0.00%:  none of these are in
0.00%:  I wanna paint him on
0.00%:  that's gonna take care
0.00%:  once again the joke
0.00%:  I know for a fact the image in
0.00%:  I was hitting on a
0.00%:  in fact it was a
0.00%:  I'm wasting time
0.00%:  two of
0.00%:  I was meaning to mention it at
0.00%:  I threw some paint on it
0.00%:  I think I can't mention
0.00%:  I promise I meant it in
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention in
0.00%:  I am in tears
0.00%:  I know he meant
0.00%:  now I'm forcing him to paint
0.00%:  I know none of that scream
0.00%:  I spent time working on the
0.00%:  that's from an
0.00%:  I imagine the paint was
0.00%:  recent
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to go n
0.00%:  I'm keeping it.
0.00%:  that one's gonna take me a few
0.00%:  I was not joking either of
0.00%:  I'm not certain who I am at
0.00%:  I'm not working as
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention in case
0.00%:  I spent a week tracing
0.00%:  I was ent
0.00%:  I'm not certain speaking of that
0.00%:  I'm not certain speaking of that now
0.00%:  there's no point in coming in
0.00%:  I think it's time to go in
0.00%:  I think we're too
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna pee in
0.00%:  he's wearing a face
0.00%:  at this point I know I'm in
0.00%:  I'm again not
0.00%:  we're not making it
0.00%:  I can imagine the reason
0.00%:  I can imagine a time in
0.00%:  I know that if someone can paint it
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna wait for paint
0.00%:  I wrote that joke in
0.00%:  I think it's time for one giant
0.00%:  I'm asking to
0.00%:  I think if I was gonna paint a
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention certain
0.00%:  now I'm speaking of that in
0.00%:  there's no point in making me eat
0.00%:  I went to an art opening once
0.00%:  I was meaning to paint more often than
0.00%:  I'm now hoping
0.00%:  I know his name in
0.00%:  none of that means I won't get
0.00%:  now I'm making one of the
0.00%:  now I'm stating the pain
0.00%:  I'm keeping on
0.00%:  there came a time I
0.00%:  I paint it from time
0.00%:  I'm not gonna eat this
0.00%:  now I'm asking for an ap
0.00%:  I'm not certain when I got into
0.00%:  I can't proof
0.00%:  now I think it's come
0.00%:  I think I meant it as more
0.01%:  I think I meant it as more of a conf
0.00%:  I think I meant it as more of an
0.00%:  I know that one is a conf
0.00%:  that is now on
0.00%:  I promise we can go
0.00%:  see
0.00%:  I'm not certain if it was the ninja one
0.00%:  I was gonna make that point in
0.00%:  as we'
0.00%:  then I saw a
0.00%:  I know it's time for me to paint an
0.00%:  I'm not an awesome painter then
0.00%:  we're past the ten
0.00%:  I promise to change it
0.00%:  I think if I compare
0.00%:  I'm not certain that one isn
0.00%:  now I'm gonna eat cere
0.00%:  I'm fine with someone
0.00%:  once again I am a
0.00%:  not in the met
0.00%:  I think I spent more time in a
0.00%:  the reason I wanna paint
0.00%:  I think it matter
0.00%:  asking
0.00%:  now I'm speaking in more
0.01%:  now I'm speaking in more than
0.00%:  I think it was a recent
0.00%:  then I went on to create a
0.00%:  that one is in
0.00%:  I'm coming off as a jerk.
0.00%:  that was a major
0.00%:  I was in ret
0.00%:  there's no fence
0.00%:  I know it's not the conf
0.00%:  now he's gonna make me paint it
0.00%:  I'm not making this a conf
0.00%:  I know I'm casting
0.00%:  I'm not gonna frame this one
0.00%:  I'm not certain taking
0.00%:  I'm not seeing the point
0.00%:  I'm gonna wait to mention this
0.00%:  I'm now certain I am speaking of
0.00%:  that I spent more time on
0.00%:  now I'm making it into a project
0.00%:  I think it's an open
0.00%:  I'm certain tonight
0.00%:  I think I'm great now
0.00%:  I was gonna paint more than
0.00%:  I was gonna paint more than once
0.00%:  now I'm gonna make it into a screen

0.00%:  there was no attempt
0.00%:  each time I paint a new
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it at a ten
0.00%:  I know I can see him
0.00%:  I'm forcing that
0.00%:  I'm gonna join
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint it after
0.00%:  I was gonna make it more
0.00%:  it was at home
0.00%:  I'm not making the point I was
0.00%:  I am certain that I am now
0.00%:  I'm hoping for some
0.00%:  I spent an entire week imag
0.00%:  game
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if he can paint it for me.

0.00%:  now that I mention it I'm facing
0.00%:  I won a contest for that
0.00%:  I think I'm react
0.00%:  I'm gonna frame it as a conf
0.00%:  I think I wore it
0.00%:  I mean that I'm certain
0.00%:  none of that means I'm great now
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I mean it as an
0.00%:  in other news I can't imagine
0.00%:  an orange
0.00%:  acting on
0.00%:  I wanna paint more than
0.00%:  now it's time for a name
0.02%:  now it's time for a name change
0.00%:  it was one of the paint
0.00%:  from now on I'm taking it
0.00%:  none of that means I won't make it
0.00%:  I want to respect
0.00%:  now I imagine it
0.00%:  in ten

0.00%:  if that's not a recipe
0.00%:  that means I won't make it
0.00%:  can we not mention that I
0.00%:  now he's eating me
0.00%:  I get comm
0.00%:  I was p
0.00%:  there was a pink nin
0.00%:  I can imagine a time when I stop
0.00%:  I smoke
0.00%:  I'm sitting on top of the
0.00%:  I'm picking on
0.00%:  I'm not a painter now so I
0.00%:  none of that is taking

0.00%:  I know for a fact I'm eating
0.00%:  it's time for me to eat
0.00%:  I can't forget to mention he was an

0.00%:  I keep that on me
0.00%:  there's a ninja in a
0.00%:  I swear I'm not making that one
0.00%:  I meant to change it
0.00%:  I'm writing on a
0.00%:  at some point I might'
0.00%:  we're gonna keep this one a
0.00%:  no matter how fast
0.00%:  if that isn't proof we
0.00%:  I was nine at the time. I'm not gonna
0.00%:  I'm knowing it
0.00%:  we're not gonna make the
0.00%:  I am most certain it
0.00%:  I promise we can get
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a scene of two
0.00%:  I promise I won't mention it ag
0.00%:  that's more paint
0.00%:  I think I'm insane for mention
0.00%:  I'm not winning that race
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint after
0.00%:  none of that means I'm not in
0.00%:  I'm fine with none of it.
0.00%:  I can't see the paint
0.00%:  it was a great moment
0.00%:  that means I'm working on it
0.00%:  now I'm speaking in another time
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention this after
0.00%:  since we're gonna mention
0.00%:  I know I'm one person
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint in front of a
0.00%:  some more
0.00%:  I meant to paint three
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was not
0.00%:  I think we're setting a
0.00%:  I think I can't win
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint more now that
0.00%:  I know for a fact he's in
0.00%:  I know I'm not forget
0.00%:  I am not gonna paint
0.00%:  I'm certain I was fifteen
0.00%:  the morning
0.00%:  that's me making it
0.00%:  there was a mention
0.00%:  now it's time to paint more
0.00%:  a part of me wants to go
0.00%:  if that's not an ancient
0.00%:  I'm not joking with
0.00%:  that perfect
0.00%:  now there's conf
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a monster face
0.00%:  I was a ninja in
0.00%:  now I'm sharing a conf
0.00%:  now I think I'm scar
0.00%:  I got his name written
0.00%:  I think I'm coming to see
0.00%:  I'm staring into the face of a new
0.00%:  that's one opinion I can
0.00%:  I was the main one
0.00%:  now I'm taking off
0.00%:  I think I'm ten again.
0.00%:  now I'm certain the past
0.00%:  it's time for me to know
0.00%:  I know I'm not a man
0.00%:  I'm fine with it. I
0.00%:  I am now a man
0.00%:  if that were in
0.00%:  since I'm keeping
0.00%:  now I can't paint to
0.00%:  that one isn't mine
0.00%:  that means I win at making
0.01%:  that means I win at making conf
0.00%:  I think it is time for a nap.
0.00%:  I think I ate it.
0.00%:  I think no one is
0.00%:  I want to come home again
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a few more so
0.00%:  I'm the one writing fiction
0.00%:  it's time again
0.00%:  it's time again for me
0.00%:  I can't imagine the worst
0.00%:  that was a joke on
0.00%:  I'm certain that if I know
0.00%:  not one of the main
0.00%:  that means I'm conf
0.00%:  then for some
0.00%:  I'm taking his
0.01%:  I'm taking his name
0.00%:  I am certain none of that is making
0.00%:  it's gonna take me a month
0.00%:  I think it was on a fr
0.00%:  I am now facing the same
0.00%:  I know he's not on
0.00%:  that I mean it
0.00%:  I'm fine keeping this conf
0.00%:  now I'm eating these
0.00%:  now I am at
0.00%:  we're keeping that one a
0.00%:  I'm not seeing how I
0.01%:  I'm not seeing how I can paint
0.00%:  I think it's far
0.00%:  I am not certain if that means
0.00%:  I can't paint if
0.00%:  it was right on
0.00%:  that means I went on
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can make that point
0.00%:  here's me acting
0.00%:  I won't mention his name again for a
0.00%:  I win the contest of
0.00%:  now there is no point
0.00%:  I know I'm an insane
0.00%:  I forget what point I'
0.00%:  I know for a fact that I'm 
0.00%:  now I am again
0.00%:  I'm nothing if not a fan
0.00%:  he was a pink
0.00%:  he was a pink one
0.00%:  I know it's after the point
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint a nin
0.00%:  we're coming off
0.00%:  I think I can mention
0.00%:  I wanna paint it for
0.00%:  I think we can agree I'm past
0.00%:  I'm gonna shake on
0.00%:  I'm not an ancient
0.01%:  I'm not an ancient master
0.01%:  I'm not an ancient painter
0.00%:  I got that from a piece
0.00%:  that I am speaking
0.00%:  I'm not an awesome painter at the
0.00%:  I went into the art
0.00%:  in fifteen
0.00%:  it was a green c
0.00%:  I'm taking those
0.00%:  I'm making a secret
0.00%:  I think I wanna paint some more to
0.00%:  that not
0.00%:  I kept it in a frame at
0.00%:  that se
0.00%:  I'm not a great sp
0.00%:  I swear I'm gonna take
0.00%:  when it came time to paint again for
0.00%:  I know I'm not the ninja master
0.00%:  if I can paint the same
0.00%:  I was not joking either time.
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint at
0.00%:  I'm meaning to paint another one.
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna mention it a
0.01%:  I think I'm gonna mention it a few
0.00%:  at no point am I certain I
0.00%:  it's not a crime to paint
0.00%:  for a moment I wasn
0.00%:  it's gonna take a major
0.00%:  I'm the ninja master
0.00%:  from this point on we can'
0.00%:  I know that first
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint it now for
0.00%:  once again I am not the
0.00%:  I'm not working in the past
0.00%:  when I paint it's not
0.00%:  I think if I were to paint at
0.00%:  from now on I am speaking
0.00%:  it's gonna take a new front
0.00%:  I'm keeping the same
0.00%:  if we're gonna pick on
0.00%:  that's it for me winning
0.00%:  I'm keeping it at that.
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna paint that scene
0.00%:  I think if I were to paint again one
0.00%:  that was me making it
0.00%:  I'm aware I can
0.00%:  I'm keeping that one in for now
0.00%:  it was on the front of a cake.
0.00%:  I can't imagine what one
0.00%:  I was gonna make that one
0.00%:  one time I wrote a poem
0.00%:  I know at some point after
0.00%:  not in a great
0.00%:  I know I meant to paint it in
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint.
0.00%:  I am nothing if not earn
0.00%:  I am nothing if not earnest in
0.00%:  I can now imagine the
0.00%:  that name is now
0.00%:  I can't imagine how to paint a more
0.00%:  I can't imagine how I kept
0.00%:  I think it was a p
0.00%:  I can't paint. I
0.00%:  I'm certain the past
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna finish
0.00%:  I wanna go to the
0.00%:  then I got an
0.00%:  I think we're opening a
0.00%:  then I was making a point
0.00%:  if there's one man
0.00%:  I think it's written in
0.00%:  wanna see
0.00%:  I think I'm star
0.00%:  none of that was a crime
0.00%:  I know that I can't imagine a time
0.00%:  he can paint too.
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a scene for
0.00%:  that time I'm speaking
0.00%:  no matter how often I paint a
0.00%:  now I'm not certain those
0.00%:  once again I am thank
0.00%:  now I'm not gonna paint the
0.00%:  I'm not one for keeping
0.00%:  I wanna change it to
0.00%:  I know that's fiction
0.00%:  the paint was in a can
0.00%:  then I can't promise I won
0.00%:  I'm at a point where I cannot see
0.00%:  that ninja is wearing
0.00%:  if I can't go
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint a new one after the
0.00%:  I'm wearing a mask that
0.00%:  it was on a note
0.00%:  now I'm asking to
0.00%:  I'm certain I want to go paint some
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint it when
0.00%:  if that were a joke
0.00%:  I'm not working off an
0.00%:  I can't not mention again
0.00%:  that makes me fear
0.00%:  I keep meaning to mention that if
0.00%:  it was a month after
0.00%:  I'm acting as if that weren
0.00%:  I can't seem to mention
0.00%:  he's wearing a cone
0.00%:  now I can see that I
0.00%:  I'm certain I want a
0.00%:  from that point on I can
0.01%:  from that point on I can see
0.00%:  I think it's gonna remain an
0.00%:  I think it's gonna remain an open
0.00%:  we're making none
0.03%:  we're making none of this canon
0.01%:  we're making none of that
0.01%:  we're making none of these
0.01%:  we're making none of these conf
0.01%:  we're making none of that canon
0.01%:  we're making none of this canon.
0.00%:  I think I'm as far
0.00%:  I think I was perfect
0.00%:  then we're coming
0.00%:  that was at a
0.00%:  now I'm gonna finish it
0.00%:  now I'm gonna mention this
0.00%:  it was a nap
0.00%:  the game's a
0.00%:  I'm keeping that awesome fact
0.00%:  I want in on that action
0.00%:  I'm certain that I am in
0.00%:  then I went to art
0.00%:  if I can't paint it again now
0.00%:  it's more of an
0.00%:  the main reason it
0.00%:  I meant to write none of this
0.00%:  it's making me want paint
0.00%:  no that was
0.00%:  I can't promise none of them
0.00%:  there's no eating
0.00%:  I know for a fact one
0.00%:  I can't think of one worse
0.00%:  now I can't not think
0.00%:  now that's an image I cannot
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I want paint
0.00%:  if I went on to
0.01%:  if I went on to paint
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a face on it
0.00%:  for once I was
0.00%:  I know he's not part
0.00%:  I know their names too
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to go. I can
0.00%:  I'm gonna make this into an
0.00%:  then I'm not certain I
0.00%:  the reason I'm not gonna make
0.00%:  I'm now certain I am speaking the
0.00%:  raising
0.00%:  I wanna get in
0.00%:  we're past the moment
0.00%:  that was me ten
0.00%:  if I were to mention the
0.00%:  if I were to mention the name
0.00%:  I promise I won't fake a
0.00%:  now I can't stop hearing it
0.00%:  I am not coming
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint that scene.
0.00%:  I think some part of me enjo
0.00%:  I'm making it so I
0.01%:  I'm making it so I can
0.00%:  now I am so
0.00%:  there was a poem in
0.00%:  there was a ninja too
0.00%:  he's wearing a to
0.00%:  no matter how I'
0.00%:  that's new
0.00%:  I'm certain that I am speaking of
0.00%:  I'm not certain of these
0.00%:  I imagine I know
0.00%:  I'm fine if that means I can
0.00%:  I think part of me is coming
0.00%:  now it's time to re
0.00%:  I'm not certain what I mean is
0.00%:  I was taking the entire time
0.00%:  I meant to paint a rock
0.00%:  I want the paint
0.00%:  I'm keeping this on
0.00%:  it's great when I can
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna eat paint
0.00%:  I think we can agree I'm not so
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint more often at
0.00%:  I choose not
0.00%:  I think if I'm not a
0.02%:  I think if I'm not a painter now
0.02%:  I think if I'm not a master
0.00%:  that time I spent on
0.00%:  I'm with certain
0.00%:  I can't imagine if there was
0.00%:  I am certain it was the one
0.00%:  then I wrote in a
0.00%:  one time I wrote a fan fiction spin
0.00%:  I'm working on these
0.01%:  I'm working on these conf
0.00%:  I think we're not meant to imagine
0.00%:  I think I care if
0.00%:  I start to
0.00%:  I'm not pro
0.00%:  I won't paint it again if
0.00%:  I might not mean
0.00%:  I think I'm opening some
0.00%:  I know I'm the one at
0.00%:  I want that in
0.00%:  I think I won't paint again after someone
0.00%:  if I was gonna paint one more
0.00%:  I am not gonna mention
0.00%:  if I'm gonna keep on
0.00%:  I think we're at point
0.00%:  that is not a recent
0.00%:  I can imagine none of the parties
0.00%:  I name that one
0.00%:  there is a point
0.00%:  I think I am one
0.00%:  I think it was on green
0.00%:  that means I'm not great
0.00%:  for this I am
0.00%:  I think I'm an awesome painter too if
0.00%:  I promise I won't make a thing of it in
0.00%:  now I'm gonna take that conf
0.00%:  it's gonna make a came
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can write it
0.00%:  that means I'm open for
0.00%:  part of me knew
0.00%:  to that I can offer no ap
0.00%:  it was green ink
0.00%:  at no point has
0.00%:  the reason I'm waiting to
0.00%:  I think if I'm not gonna
0.01%:  I think if I'm not gonna paint
0.00%:  I was te
0.00%:  I think ninjas are a
0.00%:  there's a ninja on top
0.00%:  he was an oct
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna want to see a
0.00%:  I'm not gonna repeat it in case the
0.00%:  I'm sort of into that
0.00%:  I'm certain I spent a few
0.00%:  it's taken fifteen
0.00%:  no I'm not certain I was
0.00%:  I meant to paint him after
0.00%:  now I'm certain I meant the one
0.00%:  it was on a kitchen fr
0.00%:  what I meant is
0.00%:  I'm gonna wait for that to sink in a
0.00%:  none of it makes me care
0.00%:  no point in asking me what
0.00%:  now I'm in a time
0.00%:  I am now making the case
0.00%:  I know I can't paint so
0.00%:  I saw him on
0.00%:  he knows I
0.00%:  I was gonna frame it.
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it there.
0.00%:  that's an intent
0.00%:  I got one star in
0.00%:  it took me far
0.00%:  at the time I was not
0.00%:  I was a jerk that one
0.01%:  I was a jerk that one time.
0.00%:  I was a jerk that one time in
0.00%:  the woman
0.00%:  there was a giant foot
0.00%:  if that's not ironic I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint more cats.
0.00%:  I know I'm a pain
0.00%:  I'm now certain none of that means
0.00%:  I can't wait to stop
0.00%:  I'm not the first time
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than an I
0.00%:  when it came to art
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a rose
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna compare
0.00%:  I'm hitting new
0.00%:  I think it's time for a no
0.00%:  I can't make things
0.00%:  I think I want an orange
0.00%:  now I am mort
0.00%:  I can imagine the present
0.00%:  now I think I spent
0.00%:  now I'm at the part
0.00%:  that I am now
0.00%:  I know I forgot his
0.01%:  I know I forgot his name.
0.00%:  I imagine that's proof
0.00%:  that means I can go paint
0.00%:  that means I'm certain we
0.00%:  now I can take this
0.00%:  who are
0.00%:  I'm aware that in speaking
0.00%:  I'm certain no one at
0.01%:  I'm certain no one at this point
0.00%:  I'm gonna write that in a note
0.00%:  I'm the perfect
0.00%:  I'm not often certain
0.01%:  I'm not often certain of things
0.00%:  I wanna see if I can get into the
0.00%:  I'm gonna wash it
0.00%:  he came from a
0.00%:  that's pre
0.00%:  I'm certain he got
0.00%:  I wanna paint more in
0.00%:  I know I'm past the age of nine
0.00%:  I know I'm not the main
0.00%:  that means I'm open to new
0.00%:  the reason I paint it
0.00%:  if I'm a painter who
0.00%:  now I am certain I'm the one
0.00%:  now I can't ignore
0.00%:  that's canon too
0.00%:  now I'm on another
0.00%:  I'm coming to a
0.00%:  I'm coming to a point
0.00%:  I'm coming to a point where
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention what painter
0.00%:  we can agree I'm not the
0.00%:  I wanna keep that in
0.00%:  here I am stating
0.00%:  I'm not certain when I paint again if
0.00%:  that means I can take
0.00%:  now I'm eating too
0.00%:  I was joking. I
0.00%:  none of that was fake
0.00%:  I won't stop for a
0.00%:  the reason I went in
0.00%:  I imagine that makes for
0.00%:  again I'm not certain who
0.00%:  that makes it perfect

0.00%:  none of that means I won't remain
0.00%:  that one was nine
0.00%:  I was meaning to paint it in
0.00%:  that I know it's not
0.00%:  it was a genetic
0.00%:  I'm not gonna reject
0.00%:  if I make another one
0.00%:  that I knew it

0.00%:  we can take this in
0.00%:  I came here to paint a
0.00%:  I can imagine there's no
0.00%:  I know I meant to paint it from
0.00%:  I think I can stop time
0.00%:  then I ate a cookie.

0.00%:  I'm not so into making
0.00%:  it was in the form of a cake
0.00%:  I can imagine what I
0.00%:  now I'm posting that to
0.00%:  meaning that
0.00%:  that makes me want to re
0.00%:  I'm not owning either
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint that for
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna make an
0.00%:  I'm not certain that joke

0.00%:  I think I'm sitting on one
0.00%:  since I'm not gonna mention
0.00%:  I am a grown man in
0.00%:  I know there's no canon
0.00%:  I know it's their

0.00%:  it's not great
0.00%:  I know that's not gonna earn me a
0.00%:  I'm not facing either

0.00%:  it was on a k
0.01%:  it was on a ketch
0.00%:  I'm not into making that conf

0.00%:  now I'm content
0.00%:  I'm home again
0.00%:  I was making it the center of
0.00%:  I know I'm stating the pain
0.00%:  ancient
0.00%:  I know I'm not the sort
0.00%:  that means I'm working off
0.00%:  I know it isn't perfect
0.00%:  there's a joke I
0.00%:  I'm not a painter if we
0.00%:  I want this entire
0.00%:  a part of me thinks I meant
0.00%:  I'm making the pain
0.00%:  a part of me thinks I'm gonna
0.00%:  I know it's not nice to imagine
0.00%:  it was on the mant
0.00%:  I'm certain of what I meant
0.00%:  he was a mart
0.00%:  when speaking
0.00%:  I can think of a reason
0.00%:  that was me nine
0.00%:  when it came to an
0.00%:  I know if I can
0.01%:  I know if I can't paint
0.00%:  I'm one of the smart
0.00%:  I hope we're not making
0.00%:  we are no
0.00%:  now I'm making a scene on a
0.00%:  I got into art
0.00%:  now time for a nap
0.00%:  I can write this
0.00%:  there is no winning
0.00%:  I forgot that one time I was in
0.00%:  now I can't paint another one
0.00%:  I think some time in
0.00%:  to rec
0.00%:  I'm not certain one of them wasn
0.00%:  I mean the cartoon one. I was
0.00%:  if I can't paint again
0.00%:  since I'm gonna paint that
0.00%:  now I'm an ancient
0.01%:  now I'm an ancient master
0.00%:  now I'm an ancient painter
0.00%:  I'm coming off a
0.00%:  I know it got

0.00%:  at this point I know more
0.00%:  I'm none
0.02%:  I'm none too certain
0.02%:  I'm none too certain that
0.01%:  I'm none too certain what
0.01%:  I'm none too certain I
0.01%:  I'm none too certain that I
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention what I spent
0.00%:  I'm a painter too
0.00%:  at the time I was in
0.00%:  it's written in c
0.00%:  now I'm not gonna make this
0.00%:  I can't wait for tonight
0.00%:  I think I wrote it as
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna mention it after
0.00%:  I think I was gonna paint one more
0.00%:  I want to start
0.00%:  I hope I can make
0.00%:  that's me working in
0.00%:  I think I can see it again from
0.00%:  I can think of one reason
0.00%:  it's gonna take me a few more paint
0.00%:  I am a painter
0.00%:  I'm certain one of them was a
0.00%:  now I'm making it into another
0.00%:  the reason I won't name
0.00%:  I'm gonna eat some paint
0.00%:  it matters
0.00%:  I set it on fire on
0.00%:  I know one reason
0.00%:  I think I meant to paint more of
0.00%:  that's no joke.
0.00%:  that means I'm not keeping
0.00%:  that one I'm certain was
0.00%:  I won't paint again after this one conf
0.00%:  the point I'm making is I want
0.00%:  I am that painter
0.00%:  I know there's no one in
0.00%:  I know that's for
0.00%:  I swear I'm not gonna mention that if
0.00%:  neither am I gonna
0.00%:  we can start the
0.00%:  I think if I were to paint a nin
0.00%:  I can't mention his name on
0.00%:  now I'm making it racist
0.00%:  I think I meant some
0.00%:  now it's come to
0.00%:  I can't promise him I
0.00%:  it was in a nin
0.00%:  that's not a piece
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing pants in
0.00%:  that means I'm not certain I know
0.00%:  if I can't paint a more
0.00%:  if I can't paint a more awesome
0.00%:  it's gonna take me ten
0.00%:  I'm known as
0.00%:  there we go. I
0.00%:  I think I'm coming off as an e
0.00%:  I mean I know for a fact that'
0.00%:  I think it was more of a m
0.01%:  I think it was more of a manga
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of this
0.00%:  another of
0.00%:  that fine
0.00%:  I know for a fact that I got
0.00%:  I know for a fact that I got in
0.00%:  no matter how I spin it in
0.00%:  the ironic
0.00%:  I'm not writing in
0.00%:  he was in a giant
0.00%:  none of that means I can't re
0.00%:  I'm not gonna wash it
0.00%:  none of it matters if I can't make
0.00%:  then I got into cars
0.00%:  I'm not gonna sketch
0.00%:  that means we can keep
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that in.
0.00%:  he's not wearing a k
0.00%:  I think it was more of a '
0.00%:  it's taken

0.01%:  I'm seeing if I can make
0.01%:  I'm seeing if I can make that
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can make that into
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can work
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can work that
0.01%:  I'm seeing if I can work that into a
0.00%:  it was after coming
0.00%:  I'm not asking for a p
0.00%:  I was the ninja one.
0.00%:  the reason I'm not picking on
0.00%:  I came in here wanting to paint a
0.00%:  I was facing north
0.00%:  I know that if I mention it
0.01%:  I know that if I mention it again
0.00%:  now I'm certain I no
0.00%:  I know I'm coming apart
0.00%:  I think I con
0.00%:  I forgot his weapon.
0.00%:  I'm writing fan fiction on a
0.00%:  I fear I am
0.00%:  that was more pain
0.00%:  if there's gonna
0.00%:  I think I'm a man of action
0.00%:  I think an entire
0.00%:  here I am making paint
0.00%:  now I'm either insane
0.00%:  I'm not certain I kept
0.00%:  I was more hoping
0.00%:  it was on a piece of art
0.00%:  I think I often
0.01%:  I think I often imagine
0.00%:  that makes at
0.00%:  none of that means I'm a fake
0.00%:  he was making peace
0.00%:  I can't seem to get him
0.00%:  I'm sitting at home on
0.00%:  at this point I'm gonna write
0.00%:  at one point I was certain he
0.00%:  I meant to paint his face on
0.00%:  forgot
0.00%:  I think it is now time to
0.00%:  that one's canon in
0.00%:  I am not working
0.00%:  I'm now making the first
0.00%:  now I'm coming off as the
0.00%:  if I was on the
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint it more often as
0.00%:  I'm not aware of him
0.00%:  now I can't not imagine that
0.00%:  now I'm the first one to make
0.00%:  I think I c
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than an in
0.00%:  I think I'm awesome at acting
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can make the paint
0.00%:  now I'm making the entire past
0.00%:  I know he can paint more
0.00%:  I'm seeing now
0.01%:  I'm seeing now that
0.00%:  the entire time I meant
0.00%:  now I'm certain one
0.00%:  now I'm certain one of them
0.00%:  we're not seeing
0.00%:  we're not seeing each
0.00%:  that one time I went in for an
0.00%:  the reason I'm not acting
0.00%:  as of right
0.02%:  as of right now I'm not

0.00%:  as of right now I'm no
0.00%:  I wrote fan fiction to make the
0.00%:  we're not making this canon
0.00%:  I wanna see if I can get that in
0.00%:  once again I paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one safe
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one safe in
0.00%:  there was a pine
0.00%:  can we agree that's an
0.00%:  I think I'm acting a
0.00%:  I wanna hear it
0.00%:  it's gonna take more paint than one
0.00%:  we're taking it home
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint another one since
0.00%:  I hope no one saw
0.00%:  I'm certain I mean what
0.00%:  I'm not gonna pick that
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm keeping
0.00%:  I was right to
0.00%:  I was in the room
0.00%:  I want a paint

0.00%:  there's no wip
0.01%:  there's no wiping off
0.00%:  I chose not to paint again
0.00%:  in case we're taking
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna start
0.00%:  if we're keeping that
0.00%:  that means I'm now taking
0.00%:  we're not gonna make that paint
0.00%:  I can't point fingers
0.00%:  he was a pir
0.00%:  I think I'm sorta into
0.00%:  we're speaking of it
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I somehow
0.00%:  I'm not aware of a time in
0.00%:  now I'm certain that I no
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna paint after
0.00%:  I think if I repeat

0.00%:  now I think it's a great
0.00%:  that's not me working
0.00%:  none of that makes it wrong
0.00%:  I'm certain I got some

0.00%:  I'm a pro
0.00%:  on that note I'm skip
0.00%:  at the time of writing I can

0.00%:  I can't think of a fewer
0.00%:  I make no mention of the
0.00%:  I make no mention of the fact
0.00%:  if I keep on this
0.00%:  if we're asking
0.00%:  if I were to paint again it's
0.00%:  now it's the one
0.00%:  I'm gonna write an epic

0.00%:  that was a creep
0.00%:  the game is now
0.00%:  that more
0.00%:  none of that means I'm not a jerk
0.00%:  I'm at a point where I can imagine no
0.00%:  I can now see that I
0.00%:  I'm now sitting in front of the

0.00%:  I think it was meant for an
0.00%:  that's an opening for me
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention it here
0.00%:  when I paint it again it's not
0.00%:  I can't seem to paint the
0.00%:  I'm certain he was meant
0.00%:  I forgot to paint the ninja's name
0.00%:  I can't imagine a reason to keep

0.00%:  there's a giant nin
0.00%:  I know it's not an ego trip
0.00%:  one more thing. I wasn
0.00%:  I think once again it's time for me to nap
0.00%:  the reason I'm not making it into
0.00%:  I'm certain that no one wins
0.00%:  I can't imagine where to paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint a nice
0.00%:  now I am not so

0.00%:  parts
0.00%:  I'm not gonna write this conf

0.01%:  I think it's come time for a new
0.01%:  I think it's come time for a nap
0.00%:  that's it for me. I can imagine
0.00%:  I think I want some paint again
0.00%:  we're not gonna take it
0.00%:  that means I know I'm not a great
0.00%:  I forgot to paint in his name

0.00%:  there's no can of paint in
0.00%:  there was ninja tape coming
0.00%:  I want that taken off
0.00%:  no taking
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint a new one of that

0.00%:  that's one time I wanna
0.00%:  here's me now
0.00%:  now I'm taking this paint
0.00%:  I know the paint came from a set
0.00%:  I can see that on
0.00%:  I went on to make a
0.00%:  that I went
0.00%:  I'm not joking this
0.01%:  I'm not joking this time.
0.00%:  I'm at peace knowing that if someone
0.00%:  I won't paint again if he
0.00%:  I know that part
0.00%:  I was gonna paint for the
0.00%:  there's no point in making a face at
0.00%:  I'm acting as if he were
0.00%:  I see where I'm coming
0.00%:  now I'm staring at that
0.00%:  I can't stop when
0.00%:  I got none

0.00%:  I think it's time for a cat
0.01%:  I think it's time for a cat nap now
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep the secret if
0.00%:  that image is in
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than ice
0.00%:  I think a part of me now
0.00%:  I know he came from a
0.00%:  at this point can
0.01%:  at this point can we agree
0.00%:  at this point can we agree I
0.00%:  at this point can we agree I'm not
0.00%:  I think I went on to paint
0.00%:  then I set it on fire in

0.00%:  I was the one to make
0.00%:  it was from that point
0.00%:  I meant what I'
0.00%:  now I think it's gone from
0.00%:  if that makes me a ninja t
0.00%:  now I'm making this fiction
0.00%:  it's not canon that I
0.00%:  it was on a page from the

0.00%:  I want this moment of
0.00%:  I'm certain I spoke
0.00%:  that points

0.00%:  the reason I now paint in
0.00%:  mine was the one on
0.00%:  I think it's point
0.00%:  none of it matters when I imagine
0.00%:  hitting

0.00%:  that's coming for
0.00%:  I'm not in that
0.00%:  now there's no time

0.00%:  I can't imagine what point of
0.00%:  I'm staring at it now
0.00%:  then I was nine again for a moment
0.00%:  it's gonna take me more than a few n
0.00%:  I'm not gonna repeat it with
0.00%:  I think I can offer
0.00%:  since I'm not a painter I imagine
0.00%:  I think I'm not eating
0.00%:  now I'm certain that meeting
0.00%:  now that I mention it I'm asking
0.00%:  one can
0.00%:  I'm now speaking for

0.00%:  I'm certain no one is meant
0.00%:  that at
0.00%:  I'm seeing him

0.00%:  that means I'm awake
0.00%:  time for a new conf
0.00%:  I know that's not fair of me.
0.00%:  I know that opens
0.00%:  I'm not certain how I see

0.00%:  from now on I'm picking
0.00%:  I'm now certain of that.
0.00%:  I'm sitting in front of a cake

0.00%:  I think I'm certain none of it
0.00%:  I think I'm certain none of it was

0.00%:  we're coming to that
0.00%:  we're coming to that point
0.00%:  can we not mention this again for
0.00%:  I'm making perfect
0.00%:  we're at the opening
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I was the one to make
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint him after
0.00%:  I want to paint him again if
0.00%:  he knew I
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can make it paint for
0.00%:  if that means I know

0.00%:  if I'm not wrong he
0.00%:  I'm certain if he was
0.00%:  I think at one point I was imag
0.00%:  I was hoping for one
0.00%:  the reason I'm at peace
0.00%:  I'm certain none of that means a
0.00%:  I was gonna make it into a m
0.00%:  I imagine I was not
0.00%:  if I were coming
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one in as
0.00%:  I think I'm coming to a few
0.00%:  I'm the one coming
0.00%:  now I'm speaking another
0.00%:  when I paint I imagine it
0.00%:  the cartoon was on
0.00%:  so can we agree I
0.00%:  if I paint now it
0.01%:  if I paint now it's gonna
0.01%:  if I paint now it's gonna take

0.00%:  I can't promise that if we go
0.00%:  one time I ran
0.00%:  I '
0.00%:  part of what makes it
0.00%:  here I was imag
0.00%:  I'm a man whose entire
0.00%:  it was a gift for an
0.00%:  I'm not stating
0.00%:  if I'm wrong then I take
0.00%:  so can we agree that I'm not a
0.00%:  that was me taking a
0.00%:  I'm gonna eat more chips
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint a forest
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make it past
0.00%:  it's not me who
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna paint fewer faces
0.00%:  once again I know that
0.00%:  I am in fact speaking of a
0.00%:  I'm gonna repeat that a
0.02%:  I'm gonna repeat that a few times in
0.00%:  I want to make a change in
0.00%:  making conf
0.00%:  now the paint's on me
0.00%:  that I was making a
0.00%:  I'm posting on
0.00%:  it's not certain I know
0.00%:  I imagine we can stop the
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it when I come
0.00%:  I'm not artist
0.00%:  now I spent the
0.01%:  now I spent the entire

0.00%:  I'm now freak
0.00%:  I can't think of a worse fate in
0.00%:  I spent more time ag
0.00%:  at this point I'm imag
0.00%:  since I'm not a fan of the

0.00%:  I know I'm ancient
0.00%:  I know that I'm someone
0.00%:  the reason I'm now keeping

0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint that in
0.00%:  I might not'
0.00%:  I imagine that's canon
0.00%:  I might not paint for a few
0.00%:  thanks to a recent
0.00%:  I know I meant to paint it orange
0.00%:  then I wrote some fan fiction making it

0.00%:  I'm writing fan fiction so
0.00%:  I was hoping to meet

0.00%:  now I'm sitting here a
0.00%:  we're not speaking.
0.00%:  that fear

0.00%:  I got one more
0.00%:  I am now certain none
0.01%:  I am now certain none of that
0.01%:  I am now certain none of that makes
0.01%:  I am now certain none of that is
0.01%:  I am now certain none of these
0.00%:  I am taking the
0.00%:  I'm so certain the
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I was keeping
0.00%:  I'm a man now
0.00%:  on that note. I'm gonna take
0.00%:  I'm not owning that in
0.00%:  I'm aware of none of that making it
0.00%:  I'm not not ash
0.00%:  I meant that in case
0.00%:  it was of the cart
0.00%:  at this point we can't go
0.00%:  whose name
0.00%:  I'm not naming a painter
0.00%:  come to think of it I was imag
0.00%:  I think I'm in prison
0.00%:  when I'm nin
0.00%:  we can agree it's not
0.00%:  I get one
0.00%:  I get one point
0.00%:  I get one point for that
0.00%:  I'm the first man
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new n
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new naming
0.00%:  this one time in
0.00%:  I know it's an action
0.00%:  a part of me wants to make
0.00%:  that's not mention
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint for
0.00%:  the genre
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret how I
0.00%:  I think I was nine.
0.00%:  I know there's an image in
0.00%:  there isn't a ninja in
0.00%:  I imagine that means I can
0.00%:  I'm opening with conf
0.00%:  I mean I'm not certain of
0.00%:  I wanna get that conf
0.00%:  I'm not keeping it a secret to
0.00%:  once again it's time for me to take
0.00%:  I'm not into keeping
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna score
0.00%:  here I am again to
0.00%:  I promise that I'm not a
0.00%:  I meant to paint him wearing nin
0.00%:  not that I'm gonna
0.00%:  I know I'm sitting here on
0.00%:  I make it a
0.02%:  I make it a point not
0.01%:  I make it a point to mention
0.00%:  none of that means I'm not a painter if
0.00%:  I get where
0.00%:  after that I know
0.00%:  I'm not open
0.00%:  I'm not open to hearing
0.00%:  I'm fine if that remains
0.00%:  I'm gonna promise I won
0.00%:  I'm now setting
0.00%:  I was eating cake at
0.01%:  I was eating cake at the time.
0.00%:  I'm keeping it there
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few pine
0.00%:  I knew the reason
0.00%:  I think I forgot it'
0.01%:  I think I forgot it's name
0.00%:  then I'm making
0.00%:  then one time I was at
0.00%:  that makes me we
0.00%:  I went into the paint
0.00%:  I meant to paint this
0.01%:  I meant to paint this conf
0.00%:  we're hitting on
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write it on a nap
0.00%:  I'm not certain what someone
0.00%:  now I'm making faces to
0.00%:  now I'm sort of making the
0.00%:  I think if I can't imagine
0.00%:  if there's a ninja in
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing it as
0.00%:  the reason we paint
0.00%:  I'm not certain if it makes it
0.00%:  there's a one in two
0.00%:  it was on the freak
0.00%:  I was the one nin
0.00%:  at no point was I making an
0.00%:  I won't repeat the name
0.00%:  if I'm gonna finish
0.00%:  that makes it one
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna eat some pie
0.00%:  I can't write that
0.00%:  I'm grown men
0.00%:  I think if I were to paint a scene of a man
0.00%:  I'm keeping that ninja fact
0.00%:  I know in that moment I'
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that once
0.00%:  that one time I know I
0.00%:  i'm not gonna
0.00%:  I'm certain that to
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna paint that one scene
0.00%:  I know I'm not meant for this
0.00%:  I think I can get some paint
0.00%:  that I'm not taking
0.00%:  I gotta paint a new one from
0.00%:  if I paint more
0.00%:  once again it's a
0.00%:  I know it's me again
0.00%:  he was in a tree
0.00%:  now I'm making it part
0.01%:  now I'm making it part of the
0.02%:  now I'm making it part of the canon
0.00%:  now I'm making it part of the canon.
0.00%:  I'm facing the same painter
0.00%:  I think I'm meaning it
0.00%:  now it's time for ap
0.00%:  I'm certain it was an intent
0.00%:  now I'm off the paint again.
0.00%:  that's gonna remain in
0.00%:  I think part of me is now
0.00%:  now that I am speaking of it I
0.00%:  now I'm certain a
0.00%:  I think I can point
0.00%:  each one
0.00%:  it now
0.00%:  on that note I'm asking for
0.00%:  each time I paint now I get more
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna face
0.00%:  there is now no point
0.00%:  I'm gonna make no ap
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can make it
0.00%:  if I'm not then it was
0.00%:  that means I'm a pain
0.00%:  for one
0.00%:  I see no point in making a
0.00%:  if I'm speaking the
0.00%:  I knew that sooner
0.00%:  I'm gonna che
0.00%:  I can write it
0.00%:  there was an anti
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if there
0.00%:  from now on it's a
0.00%:  I think I owe a sinc
0.00%:  I can't wait to get home so
0.00%:  I can't imagine there was a point to
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new canon of
0.00%:  I'm fine with not seeing
0.00%:  that weapon
0.00%:  I'm gonna ask for the
0.00%:  I think I meant to mean it
0.00%:  I was gonna paint nin
0.00%:  I'm not certain that was in keeping
0.00%:  that joke was more
0.00%:  that means I keep winning at
0.00%:  now I can either
0.00%:  none of that is ironic.
0.00%:  if I think of
0.00%:  if I were to go on
0.00%:  I meant to make that a
0.00%:  I meant to make that a conf
0.00%:  now I'm gonna raise the
0.00%:  I want to see if I can make it to
0.00%:  I know I can't forget it
0.00%:  that's gonna make me a
0.00%:  I'm noting

0.00%:  I'm not gonna erase it.
0.00%:  I'm not gonna erase it now
0.00%:  the reason I took

0.00%:  I meant it with
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than e
0.00%:  as a matter of fact we
0.00%:  I know it's not a comment
0.00%:  when I paint I can't get
0.00%:  there was a mic
0.00%:  I set that
0.00%:  then one time I got

0.00%:  that was more coming
0.00%:  we're taking that as a
0.00%:  often when
0.00%:  I think after we
0.00%:  I know it's an image of
0.00%:  there's no point making a new one
0.00%:  that sett
0.00%:  someone can
0.00%:  I think now I am
0.00%:  I think now I am certain
0.00%:  I wore the paint on
0.00%:  now to make things more
0.00%:  now I am certain that is
0.00%:  I think I can paint again.
0.00%:  since I think it
0.00%:  I know I'm not the first teen
0.00%:  I know I'm not the first teenage
0.00%:  that was fo
0.00%:  there's an open conf
0.00%:  at one point I wrote a fan

0.00%:  I won't mention this again in
0.00%:  no matter how often I imagine it I
0.00%:  I know I'm not certain he
0.00%:  at one point there
0.00%:  I promise I won't name that one again

0.00%:  I'm aware that no one is making
0.00%:  I'm gonna make this one a
0.00%:  I'm certain of that in
0.00%:  I promise I meant what
0.00%:  I can imagine a time where
0.00%:  I'm at the same point I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write a fan fiction som
0.00%:  I know he means
0.00%:  I won't stop.
0.00%:  there's no point in knowing if I can
0.00%:  I'm certain no one has taken
0.00%:  I'm certain none of the pain

0.00%:  somehow I'm 
0.00%:  I think I meant to scream
0.00%:  I paint it in
0.00%:  I see now that it
0.00%:  now I am certain I'm not gonna paint

0.00%:  that joke's gonna
0.00%:  I'm an honest man.
0.00%:  at this point we can agree I'm not an

0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few tim
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint another once
0.00%:  I'm gonna want to keep

0.00%:  since I'm not gonna paint the
0.00%:  if I take another step
0.00%:  it was on an open

0.00%:  I know the ninjas
0.00%:  I know the ninjas are
0.00%:  when it came time to paint one
0.00%:  s

0.00%:  I promise to go
0.00%:  now I am once
0.01%:  now I am once again the
0.01%:  now I am once again the most
0.00%:  now that I speak of it I'm certain
0.00%:  if I paint him again now
0.00%:  when it comes to a
0.00%:  that's me after knowing
0.00%:  once again I'm the first one
0.00%:  I'm not gonna ask him for a
0.00%:  each time I paint I forget
0.00%:  I'm fine when
0.00%:  I went too far on the
0.00%:  it's gonna take a few more pain
0.00%:  I forgot to make him a ninja. I
0.00%:  that was after eating nine
0.00%:  I'm not gonna confirm the
0.00%:  I am wearing that
0.00%:  it's making me want to paint one of
0.00%:  I'm gonna make these
0.00%:  I am now not certain
0.00%:  I'm not certain if it went on
0.00%:  I'm certain of a
0.00%:  I'm hoping I can take
0.00%:  I'm wearing a machine
0.00%:  I'm joking a
0.00%:  I'm aware that is an
0.00%:  I'm certain of no shame
0.00%:  from that point I was
0.00%:  I'm aware the joke
0.00%:  I know that if I'm gonna paint it
0.00%:  if I paint him again I'm not
0.00%:  I'm certain that if I paint now
0.00%:  somehow I can't take
0.00%:  I wrote in the caption of
0.00%:  I think it was a race
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I meant to go in
0.00%:  I'm sheep
0.00%:  at the moment I can
0.00%:  if I was gonna paint another time
0.00%:  I mean I'm not certain he
0.00%:  I imagine that now I
0.00%:  I can't imagine that we
0.00%:  the reason I'm owning it
0.00%:  that mic
0.00%:  I want to remain speaking in
0.00%:  now I'm off topic.
0.00%:  I want to paint a nin
0.00%:  that one isn't gonna come
0.00%:  now i'm not
0.00%:  I'm certain I saw him
0.00%:  I promise I won't mention an
0.00%:  I'm not gonna sketch it for
0.00%:  it's now making
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I want to name
0.00%:  now I'm certain that no one takes
0.00%:  we're not asking
0.00%:  now I'm making the first of
0.00%:  now I can imagine this
0.00%:  then on
0.00%:  I am now off
0.01%:  I am now off to paint
0.00%:  I wanna make this conf
0.00%:  I'm waiting for that one time
0.00%:  if I can't mention
0.00%:  I'm gonna take it one
0.00%:  I'm making the case for not
0.00%:  I think I sort of mean
0.00%:  I'm certain I keep this
0.00%:  I can't get it to work
0.00%:  I can make a
0.00%:  I won't mention that again in
0.00%:  I'm now certain I meant the
0.00%:  now I think I can taste
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was making a point.
0.00%:  I meant to take this
0.00%:  I can see that we're not gonna make
0.00%:  for most
0.00%:  that's not me opening
0.00%:  I think I won't go paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna frame that.
0.00%:  now I'm certain I am speaking in the
0.00%:  that's not water
0.00%:  I think I sne
0.00%:  there's no point making me a
0.00%:  I'm the first of
0.00%:  there was a caption. I
0.00%:  I want to paint more times
0.00%:  I think time for a
0.00%:  I think time for a nap is
0.02%:  I think time for a nap is coming
0.01%:  I think time for a nap is coming on
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna paint it for the
0.00%:  if I paint again it won
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna hear it
0.00%:  I came to terms with it
0.00%:  when I'm an
0.00%:  I'm eaten
0.00%:  I was making an intent
0.00%:  how am I gonna make
0.00%:  it was on me
0.00%:  I'm a man who often
0.00%:  I can't seem to make that
0.00%:  I'm certain the age
0.00%:  now it's a giant
0.00%:  tonight is
0.00%:  it was not of
0.00%:  it's a work of fiction in
0.00%:  it's gonna take a re
0.00%:  I wanna get some more
0.02%:  I wanna get some more paint
0.00%:  I can't promise that one time
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention it in a
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of those
0.00%:  that's coming after me now.
0.00%:  I'm certain I might not
0.00%:  I think I'm not gonna promise
0.00%:  as a painter I am
0.00%:  now I'm making ancient
0.00%:  now I'm gonna print that
0.00%:  the joke's on me for
0.00%:  the joke's on me for wanting
0.00%:  I know I'm coming off as an in
0.00%:  I'm certain no one wants to hang it
0.00%:  I was in fact nine at
0.02%:  I was in fact nine at the time of
0.01%:  I was in fact nine at the time.
0.01%:  I was in fact nine at the time I
0.00%:  I was in fact nine at the time of making
0.00%:  I think I'm waiting on a
0.00%:  he was firing a can
0.00%:  I'm wearing some of that paint.
0.00%:  now is a
0.00%:  now it's time for the pain
0.00%:  I can hear some
0.00%:  now I think it's time for a come
0.00%:  then one time I ate an
0.00%:  I know the meaning of certain
0.00%:  there was a joke at
0.00%:  I'm certain no one knows the meaning
0.00%:  I mean I'm certain that
0.00%:  I want to see if I can paint one thing
0.00%:  that is me at
0.00%:  I'm gonna make no effort
0.00%:  I'm not certain I am speaking
0.00%:  it's the wrong one. I
0.00%:  it's the wrong one. I meant
0.00%:  I'm fine sitting
0.00%:  I'm fine sitting here
0.00%:  it's on the front
0.00%:  it's on the front page
0.00%:  I am a grown man so
0.00%:  I think from now on if I paint
0.01%:  I think from now on if I paint again
0.00%:  I know I can't paint on
0.00%:  I think it cost me a
0.00%:  once again I wish I'
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I meant his
0.00%:  once again I start
0.00%:  I think I can go to
0.00%:  if I was a great
0.00%:  I'm not wasting more
0.00%:  I was hoping to one
0.00%:  I think we're enemies
0.00%:  I think we're enemies again
0.00%:  I'm so certain that knowing
0.00%:  now I'm not an art
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna pin
0.00%:  the reason I'm not 
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than one finite
0.00%:  I think we can go on
0.00%:  I can't erase that.
0.00%:  I'm gonna make an art
0.00%:  I'm not into ninjas.
0.00%:  it was after paint
0.00%:  if I'm honest I meant
0.00%:  I forgot to paint ninja sw
0.00%:  there is a 
0.00%:  I'm not gonna swear on the
0.00%:  if I'm a painter now I
0.00%:  we're making none of those
0.00%:  if I were gonna name
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna own it.
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I was into the
0.00%:  I'm awake in
0.00%:  I spent the entire time I conf
0.00%:  I promise I'm not taking that one
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna finish it
0.00%:  I know there isn't a name
0.00%:  now I'm not certain of the meaning
0.00%:  there's no point in me making a new conf
0.00%:  I imagine that's canon now
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some ro
0.00%:  I promise I won't get on
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it a secret to
0.00%:  it was a note
0.00%:  one time I was on a train
0.00%:  I meant to write I
0.00%:  now I'm off to track
0.00%:  I think it's time for a nap if I
0.00%:  I'm gonna eat this paint now
0.00%:  I can't wait to frame
0.00%:  I know for a fact I'm sitting in the
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint this one more
0.00%:  on that note I'm forcing
0.00%:  I think it's time for ninja n
0.00%:  when I paint it again one
0.00%:  I keep this a
0.00%:  now I'm certain if I keep this
0.00%:  I know I can't imagine him
0.00%:  I think it was a more
0.00%:  now I'm sitting in an art
0.00%:  no part of that is making
0.00%:  I wrote a fan fiction making them
0.00%:  it was part of a joke
0.00%:  since then I got
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that 
0.00%:  I imagine that for
0.00%:  I was making the nin
0.00%:  I'm a strange
0.00%:  I'm sitting in front of it
0.00%:  I'm gonna write it in a
0.00%:  I can't think of a time I wasn
0.00%:  answer
0.00%:  then I came into
0.00%:  since I forgot the
0.01%:  since I forgot the paint
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to no
0.00%:  now I'm sitting here face
0.00%:  I'm an actor

0.00%:  I think it's time for a man nap
0.00%:  I make no mention of that in
0.00%:  I think I won't mention art
0.00%:  I'm framing the
0.00%:  I can't seem to write
0.00%:  if I can't write
0.00%:  I can't imagine how to paint from
0.00%:  I am a 
0.00%:  if I paint another one I'm gonna take it
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a few trees
0.00%:  I'm the one facing
0.00%:  I am aware of the tension in
0.00%:  I can now imagine no
0.00%:  that was a crime
0.00%:  when I paint again I'm 
0.00%:  at this point I'm taking
0.00%:  it was the one in a
0.00%:  that means I can go paint now
0.00%:  I know that if I'm not more
0.00%:  that's on an
0.00%:  when it comes time to paint a

0.00%:  it was in one of them
0.00%:  that was one great conf
0.00%:  I was nine too

0.00%:  that time I'm not so
0.00%:  at some point in here I'
0.00%:  that was an entire mon
0.00%:  it was that moment
0.00%:  since I'm a grown man I think it
0.00%:  I know it's an image from
0.00%:  I imagine I won't paint
0.01%:  I imagine I won't paint another
0.01%:  I imagine I won't paint another one
0.00%:  now I think I'm not certain of
0.00%:  I'm now off to paint a master
0.00%:  I won the contest.
0.00%:  it was me the

0.00%:  it was on market
0.00%:  I mean the cartoon now
0.00%:  I can't imagine fewer
0.00%:  if I can't paint one
0.00%:  there was a cop in
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention where it is.
0.00%:  I think I'm too far in
0.00%:  I meant to paint one thing
0.00%:  if I'm gonna write this
0.00%:  now I'm making it another
0.00%:  I'm gonna write them into
0.00%:  I can imagine it was
0.00%:  I think we're meeting at
0.00%:  I meant it when I first
0.00%:  it was a cartoon image
0.00%:  that means I win on
0.00%:  I can't think of one reason in
0.00%:  I'm aware that I keep coming
0.00%:  I'm not making that scene
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can make the paint
0.00%:  I know it's not a recent
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna paint his
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna paint his face
0.00%:  I was aiming to paint a
0.00%:  I'm not rec

0.00%:  I'm the reason I keep
0.00%:  that's a face
0.00%:  now I make no secret
0.00%:  coming in at 
0.00%:  now I'm gonna repeat it
0.00%:  not to mention I was making a
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint for some
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that I know it
0.00%:  no matter how often I ask
0.00%:  I think I m
0.00%:  I am now certain I'm the one
0.00%:  there was no paint at
0.00%:  since paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna respect the
0.00%:  there was a caption too.
0.00%:  I think I meant to write on
0.00%:  there was a giant knife in
0.00%:  I'm certain I went on
0.00%:  to think I was a painter
0.00%:  to think I was a painter once
0.00%:  it makes me want to eat
0.00%:  now I'm gone for
0.00%:  no I am not making that
0.00%:  I'm writing it in the
0.00%:  I'm not so certain if that
0.00%:  somehow I can't make it
0.00%:  I want a piece
0.01%:  I want a piece of that
0.00%:  I think I can't repeat
0.00%:  I was gonna eat the
0.01%:  I was gonna eat the paint
0.00%:  I know he's not mine
0.00%:  I can paint one
0.00%:  I'm sh
0.00%:  if I was a painter he
0.00%:  it's gonna take three
0.00%:  I ate them
0.00%:  I know if I paint again then
0.00%:  I'm aware none of this conf
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna make the
0.00%:  I meant it in the more
0.00%:  I knew in the
0.01%:  I knew in the moment it
0.01%:  I knew in the moment I
0.00%:  I'm not that insane
0.00%:  when I came to
0.00%:  I know there's an ocean
0.00%:  it was on a giant nap
0.00%:  at some point I grew
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint a more
0.00%:  I think someone wrote me
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paste
0.00%:  I meant that in front
0.01%:  I meant that in front of women
0.00%:  I think I won't paint again in front of a
0.00%:  I'm gonna mark that one
0.00%:  now I'm ac
0.00%:  the reason I am making
0.00%:  it was on a piece of fake
0.00%:  I know it's c
0.00%:  I know it's cringe
0.00%:  it was fan fiction on
0.00%:  I think I can see it.
0.00%:  it was a team project.
0.00%:  I'm not aware of it
0.00%:  I was an imm
0.00%:  that I now
0.00%:  I think after I paint
0.00%:  I'm nothing if not awesome at
0.00%:  that means I'm a nine
0.00%:  I am not the first one
0.00%:  I'm eight now

0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret in
0.00%:  I think it's time for nap time now. I
0.00%:  now I'm making this fact
0.00%:  that means I'm now certain it
0.00%:  now I might not
0.00%:  I am certain that I am keeping
0.00%:  it was a fire
0.00%:  I think I forgot some paint in
0.00%:  I think we can agree it's fine
0.00%:  I can't stop knowing it
0.00%:  each time I repeat
0.00%:  I'm totes not making
0.00%:  I think I'm perfect as
0.00%:  I can't seem to imagine another
0.00%:  it's canon now I think
0.00%:  there it is. I am
0.00%:  since I'm a painter now
0.00%:  I j
0.00%:  I think I'm off to a
0.00%:  after this I'm gonna paint one of me
0.00%:  I'm not certain if these two
0.00%:  I was too cheap
0.00%:  I know if I'm gonna paint another
0.00%:  I'm the sort of man
0.00%:  I am not certain it wasn
0.00%:  the f
0.00%:  I knew that coming in to
0.00%:  there was a name
0.00%:  I'm sort of hoping it
0.00%:  I won't mention that since
0.00%:  I rest
0.00%:  at no point was I certain of
0.00%:  I'm gonna wanna
0.00%:  since I'm here I want to mention again
0.00%:  I'm not seeing how I can make
0.00%:  now I'm making the topic of
0.00%:  now I'm seeing in
0.00%:  I'm a fan of the entire canon
0.00%:  that I'm not certain I know
0.00%:  it's coming to me in
0.00%:  I'm making the nin
0.00%:  now I am certain that I am in
0.00%:  the main reason I'm picking
0.00%:  I think it's from a
0.00%:  now that I mention it I'm again
0.00%:  I know that it's one
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can fit that into an

0.00%:  I can't wait to rep
0.00%:  the main reason I'm no
0.00%:  that was a joke meant
0.00%:  I thinks
0.00%:  that means we can agree on
0.00%:  amongst
0.00%:  I swear I meant it
0.00%:  it was not on a
0.00%:  now the paint on
0.00%:  I can't swear it off
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I meant the nin

0.00%:  I was part of a team
0.00%:  I know there's no paint on me
0.00%:  isn't that proof
0.00%:  I'm certain it was not in
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint three
0.00%:  I think part of me wants it
0.00%:  I somehow got
0.00%:  I'm certain none of that is on
0.00%:  I won't make that face
0.00%:  then I sort
0.00%:  I'm certain that means I won
0.00%:  I'm inf
0.00%:  I know I got his
0.01%:  I know I got his name
0.00%:  now I'm making faces at the painter
0.00%:  time for me to stop
0.00%:  that one is on me.
0.00%:  I'm anti
0.00%:  that scream
0.00%:  if I was gonna mention the
0.00%:  another time
0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can paint that.
0.00%:  that's it for paint.
0.00%:  I think I'm eating too fast
0.00%:  I can't forget to mention I was an
0.00%:  I paint in green
0.00%:  in that moment it
0.00%:  I was in theatre camp
0.00%:  that I'm not asking
0.00%:  I think I want to scream

0.00%:  I know he's a fiction
0.00%:  I know I'm not a nin
0.00%:  now I can't eat for
0.00%:  it was paint mark
0.00%:  I was joking that entire time.
0.00%:  I'm hoping no one can
0.00%:  that's fifteen more
0.00%:  I can't promise I meant the one
0.00%:  I think I want some more coffee
0.00%:  I'm gonna take points for
0.00%:  none of that's gonna matter if I keep
0.00%:  the reason I'm not making a new one
0.00%:  now it's not fair to make
0.00%:  I'm not making that face for
0.00%:  I'm a man who pain
0.00%:  then we got
0.00%:  then we got into
0.00%:  then we got into an
0.00%:  I swear I'm not gonna mention that piece
0.00%:  now I think I'm setting a
0.00%:  part of me thinks I won
0.00%:  it was of a cart
0.00%:  I know for a fact that mine
0.00%:  I think at some point I re
0.00%:  I think I want to meet
0.00%:  I know that ninjas can't paint
0.00%:  if none of those were
0.00%:  that time I spent in
0.00%:  I won't mention if it
0.00%:  moments
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret that we
0.00%:  it was cart
0.00%:  it was cartoon pink
0.00%:  I get points for the
0.00%:  he's wearing ninja pant
0.00%:  I want to make that conf
0.00%:  no comment on what I'
0.00%:  shame on me for not keeping
0.00%:  I'm not certain I want his
0.01%:  I'm not certain I want his opinion
0.00%:  the reason I won't paint again in
0.00%:  I'm nine times certain I
0.00%:  I was gonna keep that entire
0.01%:  I was gonna keep that entire conf
0.00%:  a part of me can't wait
0.00%:  now I'm faking the rest
0.00%:  I think it was in a coffee
0.00%:  no I can't imagine where I
0.00%:  I can get neither
0.00%:  I'm not certain who got
0.00%:  now I'm off to tear
0.00%:  I'm not a painter of fine
0.00%:  I can't paint it for
0.00%:  I'm not so certain that one
0.00%:  I can imagine that if
0.00%:  it was the point
0.00%:  there's no canon
0.00%:  after that I went on a nine
0.00%:  I was in for a
0.00%:  we're taking the paint off
0.00%:  I think a part of me wants to go
0.00%:  I'm not picking this one
0.00%:  now I'm making this into one
0.00%:  now I cannot paint
0.00%:  now I cannot paint again
0.00%:  from this point on I can't imagine I
0.00%:  here was me
0.00%:  the reason I know I paint
0.00%:  from now on I'm taking paint
0.00%:  I won't paint again to
0.00%:  I won't paint again to confirm
0.00%:  I wanna go see
0.00%:  I think I was acting on imp

0.00%:  now I'm making this fifteen
0.00%:  I am aware it's a
0.00%:  I know I'm sitting here at
0.00%:  I think it's time to face new
0.00%:  now I'm off on
0.00%:  that time I was in
0.00%:  I forgot to take the
0.00%:  that is me facing
0.00%:  I'm not gonna start now
0.00%:  I won't mention them
0.01%:  I won't mention them again in
0.01%:  I won't mention them again in case
0.01%:  I won't mention them again.
0.01%:  I won't mention them again if
0.00%:  I won't mention them again in front
0.00%:  I won't mention them again in case I
0.00%:  I won't mention them again for
0.00%:  I think we can agree it's not a met
0.00%:  I'm making a point that
0.00%:  I know that I'm too
0.00%:  if that's not tragic
0.00%:  I can't erase that knowing
0.00%:  that's an opinion from
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that first one into
0.00%:  I think it's time to open a new fr
0.00%:  I think it was an ocean
0.00%:  I promise I won't again
0.00%:  the reason I know a
0.00%:  if I'm keeping score I
0.00%:  now I think it's time for me to nap again.
0.00%:  then I was taken into
0.00%:  at the time I was more
0.00%:  there's no point if
0.01%:  there's no point if I can
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna frame it now so
0.00%:  I swear I'm not in the
0.00%:  I'm not a painter in a
0.00%:  now I'm eating a cookie that
0.00%:  I see no point in mention
0.00%:  I wrote it into
0.00%:  now I'm another
0.00%:  it's two
0.00%:  it was from the n
0.00%:  I'm gonna confirm
0.00%:  since I'm not that into
0.00%:  I am not in fact a painter now
0.00%:  I am in fact not a master
0.00%:  I mention that for a
0.00%:  I think I want to paint more ninjas
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a new one for me
0.00%:  I'm certain that now I am speaking in
0.00%:  I think I won't name names again
0.00%:  I'm wearing the skin
0.00%:  I was gonna mention it in
0.00%:  I know that I'm in for
0.01%:  I know that I'm in for some
0.00%:  now I'm ang
0.00%:  I'm not staring
0.00%:  I'm working on the fiction
0.00%:  after this I'm gonna paint a nice
0.00%:  I can't stop time from
0.00%:  I know some of that'
0.00%:  the main reason I can't keep
0.00%:  I see the par
0.00%:  I think I want some more paint to
0.00%:  none of that was meant to inc
0.00%:  if that's not an opening
0.00%:  I know it's not a ninja thing
0.00%:  it's making me horn
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint the new one for
0.00%:  if I were to come
0.00%:  I'm gonna take a nap on
0.00%:  I know that project
0.00%:  I mean that one time I was
0.00%:  I perfect
0.00%:  now I'm eating an ice
0.00%:  I'm open to other
0.00%:  I am certain of no
0.00%:  the name's on
0.00%:  now here I am at
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna paint a fr
0.00%:  I was joking after
0.00%:  I am now certain that nin
0.00%:  I think I scream
0.00%:  I'm aware none of that points
0.00%:  I can't imagine the reason I mention
0.00%:  I'm not a painter in the fig
0.00%:  there's no point in me taking off
0.00%:  I sort of meant it in
0.00%:  I know it's ironic that I paint
0.00%:  that is a met
0.00%:  neither time
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that part
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a non
0.00%:  I know he's great
0.00%:  now I'm certain that no one is making
0.00%:  no matter how nice
0.00%:  none of that means I'm an e
0.00%:  now that I'm certain it
0.00%:  I know I'm not the first on
0.00%:  not so
0.00%:  now I'm off to paint again. I think
0.00%:  I'm certain that someone wanting
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a few more once
0.00%:  the reason I know paint
0.00%:  I think it's time for a nap n
0.00%:  I meant it to mean
0.00%:  I can't think of paint
0.00%:  at this point I'm frank
0.00%:  we can agree that paint
0.00%:  I was then 
0.00%:  none of that matters if we can
0.00%:  I'm keeping this fact a
0.00%:  I think I mean to paint a
0.00%:  I can't imagine that went
0.00%:  I get to paint for
0.00%:  that one time I'm gonna
0.00%:  if we're not making
0.00%:  if I were to paint this conf
0.00%:  I am certain it wasn
0.00%:  so I'm gonna
0.00%:  now I'm off to make art
0.00%:  I know it's not a perfect time
0.00%:  I own no shame
0.00%:  I won't confirm if that means
0.00%:  if we're on the topic of ninjas I
0.00%:  I am aware that one of
0.00%:  I wrote fan fiction at the same
0.00%:  that makes me care
0.00%:  I think I wanna paint more too
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new fence
0.00%:  I wanna go paint more.
0.00%:  I know it's not a great ep
0.00%:  then I wrote a note on

0.00%:  I think it's a major
0.00%:  I was nine at the time it
0.00%:  if I were to make things
0.00%:  I think ninjas were a
0.00%:  then I was on to

0.00%:  we're an
0.00%:  I was hoping to not
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint it the
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint it the same
0.00%:  I'm aware none of that is in keeping

0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some ice
0.00%:  is it wrong that I'm not
0.00%:  it was meant to re
0.00%:  then I know for a fact it
0.00%:  I think it's on a
0.00%:  the reason I know I'm gonna
0.00%:  we're not speaking of him in
0.00%:  the main reason I'm not opening
0.00%:  I'm now gonna paint that scene

0.00%:  none of that makes me want to re
0.00%:  I am aware of these
0.00%:  I promise I won't mention the ninja again.
0.00%:  if I spent more
0.01%:  if I spent more time on
0.00%:  it's coming from the point
0.00%:  here we get
0.00%:  here we get into
0.00%:  I'm intent on making that conf
0.00%:  that's mine
0.00%:  I'm none too certain what I meant
0.00%:  there was a kitten
0.00%:  if someone were to paint it
0.00%:  if I was to paint another one I
0.00%:  I think I'm not gonna paint some
0.00%:  I'm not an awesome painter if I can
0.00%:  I went to night

0.00%:  now I see a
0.00%:  I once got in a fist
0.00%:  I hope I'm wearing
0.00%:  I think it's rape
0.00%:  I think it's time once again for a new name
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a fence
0.00%:  I can't ignore that I
0.00%:  I can't wait to get on
0.00%:  I'm certain no one wants to paint a
0.00%:  I think I can go into
0.00%:  now I'm speaking of the entire canon
0.00%:  that is an entire
0.01%:  that is an entire conf
0.00%:  once again I think it's time for n
0.00%:  that means I get a new
0.00%:  now I'm not sharing paint
0.00%:  no I'm not speaking in the
0.00%:  I think in terms
0.00%:  it's not gonna matter how I
0.00%:  now I'm forcing it into a
0.00%:  I think it's time I power
0.00%:  I think now is a perfect time to go
0.00%:  I think I'm fifteen again now
0.00%:  the reason I'm taking an
0.00%:  I was the age of nine
0.00%:  I am now certain that if I'
0.00%:  I'm working that into a conf
0.00%:  at this point I'm re
0.00%:  it was an o
0.00%:  I'm certain I know the name of one
0.00%:  I know that it's not a conf
0.00%:  I get the point of
0.00%:  I'm once again in
0.00%:  I'm once again in the market
0.00%:  there's no acting
0.00%:  I can't promise that now I
0.00%:  I know I secret
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna eat a sn
0.00%:  it's not gonna take a
0.00%:  now there's a knife
0.00%:  at this point I'm not aware
0.00%:  that means I can imagine no

0.00%:  at one point I wrote in
0.00%:  I was ten once
0.01%:  I was ten once again

0.00%:  I mean it as an
0.00%:  I meant it in a fig
0.00%:  none of that was fiction.
0.00%:  when I mention it I
0.00%:  that means we cannot

0.00%:  right now I'm pain
0.00%:  once again I open

0.00%:  I was in pain after
0.00%:  I want to paint one more time. I
0.00%:  I'm not a painter who can make
0.00%:  then I can paint

0.00%:  I know that I meant it in
0.00%:  he's not making a
0.00%:  I know I'm a strange
0.00%:  it was on a paint
0.00%:  I meant it the first
0.00%:  now I'm the one coming
0.00%:  the reason I'm now in
0.00%:  one of them was a giant
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than one in

0.00%:  now I can't see the point of making
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was at
0.00%:  he was green too.
0.00%:  none of that means I'm perfect
0.00%:  it's that moment again
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna eat one more
0.00%:  I ran into a
0.00%:  I can't think of one more paint
0.00%:  then I ate a can
0.00%:  that's me wearing an
0.00%:  I know he's not a t

0.00%:  since I know I'm not that great an
0.00%:  I'm working off that
0.00%:  the entire time I wasn
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint one more scene

0.00%:  I think it's time for eating
0.00%:  I know for a fact it's me
0.00%:  I'm at a point where I can mention

0.00%:  I think we're gonna see if I can paint one of
0.00%:  I think I was more intent
0.00%:  that one isn't gonna make it
0.00%:  I know it's not age
0.00%:  now I'm ske
0.00%:  I know it's a cartoon I
0.00%:  I swear I am not making that
0.00%:  now I am making that
0.00%:  now I am making that conf
0.00%:  if I make another one I'm gonna

0.00%:  I know I can't hear it
0.00%:  I know I am the
0.00%:  now I'm once again the most in
0.00%:  I know the one I
0.00%:  I know the one I meant
0.00%:  I know the one I meant to paint
0.00%:  none of it was canon
0.00%:  I'm seeing a certain
0.00%:  I wish I meant it
0.00%:  now I am in the
0.00%:  I can't promise I got it
0.00%:  now I'm making it perfect
0.00%:  now there's a ninja in
0.00%:  I imagine I'm project
0.00%:  I'm a skeptic of the
0.00%:  then I went for ice
0.00%:  that's me facing a
0.00%:  that's me facing a new
0.00%:  that's me facing a new front
0.00%:  it's a fair
0.00%:  it was an image of
0.00%:  I want to see if I can hear
0.00%:  we're coming at
0.00%:  no I'm not taking this conf
0.00%:  I spent the entire time I'
0.00%:  I know that once again I'm not
0.00%:  it was a generic
0.00%:  I want to paint him again once
0.00%:  I think I spent time in
0.00%:  I got that part
0.00%:  I think I'm an artist again
0.00%:  once again I throw
0.00%:  I was keeping it for
0.00%:  I won't mention it in
0.00%:  I promise I won't mention it again at a
0.00%:  if I paint it now it's gonna make
0.00%:  the reason I want to go
0.00%:  that makes one time I can
0.00%:  now I'm certain that nine
0.00%:  within
0.00%:  not the one wearing
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint this in water
0.00%:  I know the painter's name came
0.00%:  it's more than fine
0.00%:  if we're gonna mention him
0.00%:  I'm not a painter too
0.00%:  I was a fan of the cartoon in
0.00%:  I swear that one
0.00%:  I was into anime
0.00%:  I want a cookie from
0.00%:  I am certain that speaking
0.00%:  it was an em
0.00%:  now I can't go to
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a penc
0.00%:  I'm not asking for one pen
0.00%:  I'm gonna repeat that a few times if
0.00%:  now I think I got it
0.00%:  to imagine
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was gonna
0.00%:  if I'm not wrong in
0.00%:  I mean the cartoon one in
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a cow for
0.00%:  I can't keep them
0.00%:  in front of me is a woman
0.00%:  once again I'm honest
0.00%:  I wrote a note asking him
0.00%:  if I'm not right
0.00%:  now it's time to face an
0.00%:  now I can't not imagine it
0.00%:  I'm not a painter if that
0.00%:  I'm not a painter if that makes
0.00%:  I keep meaning to mention that for
0.00%:  I think I'm nine again
0.00%:  that means we're not eating
0.00%:  as for that
0.00%:  there's a joke I can
0.00%:  in a moment of strange
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna paint that
0.00%:  now I am an
0.00%:  I think it got a
0.00%:  I'm wearing some of the paint I
0.00%:  I'm not too certain if he
0.00%:  I'm not too certain if he was
0.00%:  I think it's time I wrote a conf
0.00%:  the patron
0.00%:  I was gonna keep that one in for
0.00%:  I think we can agree it's in
0.00%:  I meant that I was nine
0.00%:  I know none of it means
0.00%:  when I paint it's more
0.00%:  there's no point making it canon
0.00%:  I'm not certain now if that means
0.00%:  in fact I was making
0.00%:  I'm not keeping in
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint him into a
0.00%:  that is not at
0.00%:  I meant to ask him if
0.00%:  I can paint again.
0.00%:  we're not speaking of that moment
0.00%:  I can't think of one reason it
0.00%:  I were
0.00%:  I was gonna mention he
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that one in a
0.00%:  I can see it.
0.00%:  at some point I'm 
0.00%:  in fact it'
0.00%:  I'm keeping it in the canon
0.00%:  same
0.00%:  I know that opinion means
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some new art
0.00%:  when I paint it again some
0.00%:  here's to facing
0.00%:  I know I'm not respect
0.00%:  now I think a
0.00%:  I was gonna paint him in a
0.00%:  then I set it on fire. I
0.00%:  then I set it on fire. I know
0.00%:  no I can't promise not
0.00%:  now it's gonna take me an entire
0.00%:  I think it's time I paint once
0.00%:  I'm speaking of the time
0.00%:  I think now I'm gonna paint one
0.00%:  I'm past caring
0.00%:  I'm certain he meant
0.00%:  I can't seem to forget it.
0.00%:  that's me 
0.00%:  he was pro
0.00%:  it got me a
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna face paint for
0.00%:  when I got a
0.00%:  I know at some point in time
0.00%:  that escape
0.00%:  I'm making it a point not
0.00%:  I was ch
0.00%:  I'm a con artist
0.00%:  that time I'm 
0.00%:  that makes me at
0.00%:  there was a po
0.00%:  none of that means I can't write in
0.00%:  it's one thing to know
0.00%:  I meant to paint a cat
0.00%:  it was the green ninja.
0.00%:  it wins

0.00%:  I think i'm gonna paint more
0.00%:  I think i'm gonna paint more often
0.00%:  I know I'm not an ancient master of the
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint more than once in
0.00%:  one time when I got

0.00%:  it was ninja.
0.00%:  I'm raising that
0.00%:  I'm raising that conf
0.00%:  I know that I can imagine
0.00%:  I'm certain that one mistake
0.00%:  from this point on I can imagine
0.00%:  I know that once again I am
0.00%:  I'm not certain I meant to open
0.00%:  there's a met
0.00%:  there's no point making a com
0.00%:  I'm a giant piece

0.00%:  that's not me in a
0.00%:  if none of that was meant
0.00%:  one time I came
0.00%:  I won't mention him again to spare
0.00%:  I swear I'm gonna keep it
0.00%:  none of that makes me a winner
0.00%:  we're making each

0.00%:  that's open
0.00%:  that's open for
0.00%:  I know that's not a perfect an
0.00%:  since I'm not a fan of either
0.00%:  now I'm making it the entire
0.00%:  I can't imagine there was a time
0.00%:  I know I'm not ninjas
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention if I was 
0.00%:  I can't make them

0.00%:  in the spirit of making
0.01%:  in the spirit of making conf
0.00%:  I know for a fact it's a nin

0.00%:  one time I threw a can of paint at some
0.00%:  I can't imagine it from
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new name tag
0.00%:  I know there's an ancient

0.00%:  we can agree on that one
0.00%:  we can agree on that one point
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint the nin

0.00%:  I'm sort of the
0.00%:  I know that opinion'
0.00%:  now I'm sitting in front of a nice

0.00%:  here I am conf
0.00%:  I'm not certain it was the ninja one
0.00%:  I know I can't paint either one as

0.00%:  what I'm not certain of is if I meant
0.00%:  that's once again a
0.00%:  I'm now too
0.00%:  if it were the
0.00%:  I want him to see
0.00%:  he was for
0.00%:  I swear I'm 
0.00%:  I'm most certain that opinion
0.00%:  that means I'm freak
0.00%:  we can agree that I'm not one
0.00%:  I think at some point we can agree I'm not
0.00%:  I am now sitting in the
0.00%:  that's one more of
0.00%:  at this point I'm on
0.00%:  I know that isn't a fair

0.00%:  I was neither a
0.00%:  I think I came on a
0.00%:  I think I ate paint once
0.00%:  then I kept on
0.00%:  I wrote in the caption '
0.00%:  I'm gonna face this
0.00%:  I mean it in the most generic
0.00%:  I can paint him again
0.00%:  I might want to remain

0.00%:  that means if I can paint
0.00%:  a new
0.00%:  I think I'm an awesome painter at 
0.00%:  I meant to paint a nice

0.00%:  I think in a few more
0.00%:  I'm wearing the ninja mask.

0.00%:  I know for a fact things
0.00%:  I'm certain none of that taken
0.00%:  I'm certain making those two
0.00%:  that one time I won a race
0.00%:  when I'm a
0.01%:  when I'm a painter
0.01%:  when I'm a master
0.00%:  I know he's not great

0.00%:  in that one instant
0.00%:  I meant to ask where
0.00%:  I am not certain that was
0.00%:  it was on a mac
0.00%:  I'm certain that I am one
0.00%:  it was on that one page I
0.00%:  if I paint more than
0.01%:  if I paint more than once
0.00%:  if I paint more than one
0.00%:  it's not the one I want
0.00%:  I'm not certain if that goes
0.00%:  I'm gonna eat this one
0.00%:  I can paint one thing
0.00%:  once again I was the

0.00%:  now I'm inf
0.00%:  I'm certain as he
0.00%:  I can't promise how I
0.00%:  I was joking the entire time. I'm an
0.00%:  I know I'm not paint
0.00%:  I'm certain I meant none of it as a joke.
0.00%:  I think I wanna paint som

0.01%:  if I'm not wrong that means
0.00%:  if I'm not wrong that makes
0.00%:  I think it was part

0.00%:  I am the one speaking now
0.00%:  I mean to paint more often in
0.00%:  I wanna keep that fact
0.00%:  that's not fair.
0.00%:  since we're on it
0.00%:  now I think I'm free to paint again if
0.00%:  it was a joke I
0.00%:  I'm gonna stare into
0.00%:  I was nine at that time.
0.00%:  I want to make one more thing pain

0.00%:  it was after I ate nine
0.00%:  from now on I am taking
0.00%:  I know that if I can't paint a
0.00%:  that I'm in no
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna fake
0.00%:  if I can't think
0.00%:  if I can't think of a reason
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that into a conf
0.00%:  I think I'm now coming to a
0.00%:  the entire time I'm speaking I can
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was hoping
0.00%:  I'm gonna wipe that from canon
0.00%:  man was
0.00%:  once again we see that I'm a
0.00%:  I think we're into
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing paint
0.00%:  now I'm the same painter
0.00%:  I know I'm not a painter of the finest
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some f
0.00%:  I am certain that if we
0.00%:  I'm taking one
0.00%:  I'm taking one for
0.00%:  I'm taking one for the team in
0.00%:  I'm taking one for the team.
0.00%:  I'm taking one for the team on
0.00%:  I won't mention paint again

0.00%:  I'm gonna start with a conf
0.00%:  I know I can't paint more than one image
0.00%:  I'm not certain what age is
0.00%:  I'm certain the main
0.00%:  I'm certain the main point
0.00%:  it was fo
0.00%:  now I think it's not fair
0.00%:  I got it from an awesome
0.00%:  I'm certain that was nine
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it this
0.00%:  I keep it in a secret
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that action
0.00%:  I'm so certain that we
0.00%:  I'm gonna write that name on
0.00%:  I think I'm swe
0.00%:  I'm now certain that ninjas
0.00%:  is that a
0.00%:  is that a conf
0.00%:  I'm not cop
0.00%:  there was no giant
0.00%:  I think if I write
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna escape from
0.00%:  the ninja name
0.00%:  I know the artist can
0.00%:  not his
0.00%:  I can't promise an
0.00%:  I rep
0.00%:  none of that was ter
0.00%:  I sort of hate
0.00%:  at one point I think I meant
0.00%:  I think it won a
0.01%:  I think it won a contest
0.00%:  I'm gonna repeat that I
0.00%:  we're not making this one canon
0.00%:  I'm not joking in that
0.00%:  now it's time for me to enhance
0.00%:  I think if I forgot
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that in fiction
0.00%:  it's coming in at
0.00%:  that's me at age nine
0.00%:  I think it's an orange
0.00%:  now I'm not certain of it
0.00%:  from now on the
0.00%:  a part of me thinks we
0.00%:  I am certain he is
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint faces
0.00%:  I'm toast
0.00%:  I can't paint the rest
0.00%:  there's a pic
0.00%:  I'm fine keeping that secret to
0.00%:  I'm certain I meant to paint one
0.00%:  I think it was on a cement
0.00%:  I think it's in a frame at
0.00%:  I'm not gonna want
0.00%:  since I'm making other
0.00%:  I can't imagine it not
0.00%:  I think I'm great at some
0.00%:  he's a cartoon now
0.00%:  I saw it in the
0.00%:  since when am I opening
0.00%:  I'm certain that is not an
0.00%:  I'm not gonna swear it
0.00%:  I can't stop now for
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna create a new paint
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint new master
0.00%:  the point I'm making in
0.00%:  paint isn
0.00%:  I was making the art
0.00%:  it was part of a game
0.00%:  that means I can't rep
0.00%:  now I'm making a scene in front of a paint
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint on a more
0.00%:  I think I'm awesome for a
0.00%:  I got that from a joke
0.00%:  I can sort of imagine him
0.00%:  I'm naming the new
0.00%:  it was after the paint
0.00%:  it's one of the few pain
0.00%:  that's me now.
0.00%:  I was not making an
0.00%:  I forgot it was pink
0.00%:  I meant it in the wrong
0.00%:  I'm certain I was not making a
0.00%:  at no point can I imagine the
0.00%:  I think we're coming to an imp
0.00%:  that I am speaking from
0.00%:  I think I'm meant to paint in
0.00%:  I was a nice
0.00%:  each time I paint from
0.00%:  each time I paint from now on it
0.00%:  each time I paint from now on is
0.00%:  each time I paint from now on I get
0.00%:  now I'm on a train of shame
0.00%:  I know it's not in the canon
0.00%:  I can't swear that none
0.00%:  it was of a cartoon.
0.00%:  I'm making a case for not
0.00%:  then I ate an entire case
0.00%:  I'm not certain when I get
0.00%:  I see that writing
0.00%:  that one's wrong
0.00%:  I wanna take a
0.02%:  I wanna take a moment
0.01%:  I wanna take a moment here
0.00%:  one time I spent a week
0.00%:  I am now speaking more
0.00%:  one of the main points I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a scene from it
0.00%:  I think it's now time for me to nap.
0.00%:  now here I am making a
0.00%:  I know there's no point in eating
0.00%:  then I forgot I was on
0.00%:  I'm prem
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can write
0.00%:  I can paint in three
0.00%:  the entire time I knew
0.00%:  now I can't think of a painter
0.00%:  I'm aware that none of it is coming
0.00%:  I know it comes from the
0.00%:  I'm not an artist who can imagine
0.00%:  if none of these are
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make this into an
0.00%:  I knew that coming in too
0.00%:  I am not a man of
0.00%:  I am once again the person
0.00%:  I'm not too freak
0.00%:  I think I sniff
0.00%:  it's one of the few I
0.00%:  it's one of the few I can
0.00%:  I'm gonna wait three
0.00%:  there was no name on it
0.00%:  I'm certain I meant the one in
0.00%:  I was in a time machine to
0.00%:  I know that means none
0.00%:  now the paint's gone
0.00%:  I'm not gonna write it on the
0.00%:  he's in a pair
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some for a
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint from now
0.00%:  I was more into the paint
0.00%:  it's canon that none
0.00%:  I'm a man who pre
0.00%:  when I paint again it's a
0.00%:  I am speaking to
0.00%:  in fact it was the
0.00%:  I'm speaking at
0.00%:  it was a repeat
0.00%:  I know I'm not meant for the
0.00%:  no part of me thinks I can
0.00%:  that means I'm a painter too
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint more once we
0.00%:  I promise I won't think of it
0.00%:  that means I paint more
0.00%:  I wrote it in giant
0.00%:  I think I can see it in front of me in
0.00%:  I imagine that won't come
0.00%:  I'm certain that I keep meaning
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna rate
0.00%:  it's one of the great
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it awesome
0.00%:  that's not gonna make me win
0.00%:  now I'm gonna take an

0.00%:  I'm gonna shame
0.00%:  I'm not certain I meant a
0.00%:  I'm a ninja master too
0.00%:  I'm on pain
0.00%:  I am taking this entire

0.00%:  I'm either coming
0.00%:  I can't imagine his work
0.00%:  I think in a perfect
0.00%:  I meant to spit when
0.00%:  now it is time for a conf
0.00%:  I know I'm not that into
0.00%:  in fact I think we
0.00%:  proof that I was
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of met
0.00%:  I was gonna paint me into
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make art
0.00%:  I think I'm naming it
0.01%:  I think I'm naming it after
0.00%:  if I'm working
0.00%:  I promise I'm acting
0.00%:  I know I'm not a priest
0.00%:  I was taking the met
0.00%:  then one time I got in
0.00%:  I was gonna mention it to
0.00%:  I came in knowing none of this.
0.00%:  we're gonna skip that one
0.00%:  I think I was meant to mention
0.00%:  soon after I went
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna rip
0.00%:  I can't see the par
0.00%:  that is an image I can
0.00%:  now I am certain I am an
0.00%:  I know the painter I'm most
0.00%:  I'm hoping no one wants
0.00%:  I know I am the reason
0.00%:  I'm a father
0.00%:  I'm a father now
0.00%:  I'm now making that face
0.00%:  one sec
0.00%:  I know these are not in
0.01%:  I know these are not in fact
0.00%:  it was from action
0.00%:  it makes me want another
0.00%:  I know the reason I'm in
0.00%:  that I'm keeping a
0.00%:  that I'm keeping a secret
0.00%:  that means I'm now eating
0.00%:  I'm gonna want to keep this
0.00%:  since we're in the moment
0.00%:  I think I won't paint again in fear
0.00%:  now I get the
0.00%:  I'm not certain if that goes on
0.00%:  then again I'm not certain if I was
0.00%:  if there's not an
0.00%:  if I'm wrong that means it
0.00%:  the point is I know
0.00%:  I'm gonna mention that piece
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep the first one
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint com
0.00%:  I think I'm in tears.
0.00%:  now I'm naming prices
0.00%:  to make matters inf
0.00%:  I'm the first one to notice.
0.00%:  I'm aware it can
0.00%:  I'm not keeping it a secret in
0.00%:  I know it's not fair I get
0.00%:  I am not certain whose
0.00%:  I think if I were to point
0.00%:  no part of me thinks it
0.00%:  I think I'm an orange
0.00%:  I'm not certain the tension
0.00%:  the pen
0.00%:  the main reason I can't take
0.00%:  I forgot paint can
0.00%:  I think it's a fair comment on
0.00%:  I was not a painter of
0.00%:  I won't paint it again for the
0.00%:  I won't paint it again for the same
0.00%:  now I'm speaking in fiction.
0.00%:  I cast
0.00%:  now I'm not gonna paint the rest
0.00%:  it was of the entire team
0.00%:  I know I'm great at this
0.00%:  I think I mean to paint it again some
0.00%:  great
0.00%:  I'm not the person making
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a few finite
0.00%:  I was a fan of them
0.00%:  no I won't stop making
0.00%:  now I'm making this entire paint
0.00%:  I think it was on a piece of man
0.00%:  I am now certain that someone'
0.00%:  I know there's no peace
0.00%:  I'm gonna make that into a coffee
0.00%:  now it's time for me to eat an
0.00%:  since I'm aware of that I
0.00%:  I think it was morning time
0.00%:  I know that's not fair to pain
0.00%:  I know I'm not gonna meet
0.00%:  I'm gonna make sweet
0.00%:  now I'm gonna paint it after
0.00%:  none of that is gonna make me paint
0.00%:  if I paint another one I can see
0.00%:  it's gonna take me another two
0.00%:  I know it's a cartoon in the
0.00%:  I think it's time for a nap on a
0.00%:  at this point I'm not making new conf
0.00%:  if we're taking the
0.00%:  I know from this
0.00%:  the reason I'm facing a
0.00%:  I sort of think I'm a
0.00%:  I can't imagine what spark
0.00%:  I cringe at the mention
0.00%:  none of that means I won't paint if
0.00%:  I'm aware nothing can make
0.00%:  I think if I'm not a painter soon
0.00%:  it was fine.
0.00%:  I know I'm certain of one
0.00%:  at the time I wrote
0.00%:  now I'm gonna take another fifteen
0.00%:  I was a giant pain
0.00%:  I was a giant pain in the neck
0.00%:  I'm off the wagon
0.00%:  if I were to paint him I
0.00%:  not the one I
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than fame
0.00%:  now I'm pat
0.00%:  now it's freak
0.00%:  I am the first man
0.00%:  I'm not c
0.00%:  after that one I went
0.00%:  now it's time for me to paint in a
0.00%:  now I'm certain I get
0.00%:  I think I can now rest
0.00%:  if I'm not the most
0.00%:  now I'm naming art
0.00%:  now I'm naming art pieces
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna insert
0.00%:  at this point I'm gonna make a conf
0.00%:  I think it's gonna mean
0.00%:  I think it's gonna mean more
0.00%:  the engine
0.00%:  I know I can't finish
0.00%:  I want to make a point here
0.00%:  I'm not certain if it was on the
0.00%:  on this topic I'm gonna
0.00%:  I know the paint came from an
0.00%:  I know there's no can
0.00%:  I think I can promise a
0.00%:  it was an image taken
0.01%:  it was an image taken from the
0.00%:  I'm wrong in
0.00%:  I'm the same age in
0.00%:  I'm taking the paint off
0.00%:  now I'm sitting in a tree
0.00%:  I can't think of a more awesome ep
0.00%:  I think none of it was meant for
0.00%:  that one part isn
0.00%:  I'm tiring of the
0.00%:  I know the meaning of iron
0.00%:  I was meaning to mention in
0.00%:  come to think of it I wanna get
0.00%:  I was on am
0.00%:  I'm a woman of
0.00%:  I was a giant jerk in the 
0.00%:  now I'm sitting on an
0.00%:  that was a joke I'm not
0.00%:  come on.
0.00%:  I think time is
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to imagine he
0.00%:  no I won't paint again after
0.00%:  I get one point for each
0.00%:  that's one more nin
0.00%:  that's one I can
0.00%:  I know there's not a point in
0.00%:  I can promise that I won't get
0.00%:  I think I swear too
0.00%:  I think if I was gonna paint it
0.00%:  I promise I'm not wanting
0.00%:  we're not on the speaking

0.00%:  I wanna keep this one a
0.00%:  I think I'm more fasc
0.00%:  now I can't see the point in making
0.00%:  now it's time for an int
0.00%:  it was a gift for mom
0.00%:  now I'm speaking iron
0.00%:  the more I know
0.00%:  I meant to paint one of them
0.01%:  I meant to paint one of them wearing
0.00%:  I went to space
0.00%:  I'm not joking either. I
0.00%:  I think it's time to go in for a new
0.00%:  I'm not certain how to tie
0.00%:  I'm not wanting to make this conf
0.00%:  we can take that moment
0.00%: . I'm gonna stop
0.00%: . I'm gonna stop there
0.00%:  I'm a fan fiction
0.00%:  I set it on fire once
0.00%:  I think I'm meant to paint again now
0.00%:  now I think I'm gonna sne
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than a fine point
0.00%:  I think I mean to paint it again.
0.00%:  it's gonna take a pain
0.00%:  I'm not wanting to come
0.00%:  change of
0.00%:  isn't there

0.00%:  at this point we're not making
0.00%:  I wrote it in magic

0.00%:  now I'm making no secret that
0.00%:  it works
0.00%:  I imagine I'm certain
0.00%:  that means I'm now in a
0.00%:  when I'm at
0.00%:  when I'm at parties
0.00%:  I think I got a few facts
0.00%:  it's me that

0.00%:  I'm not a painter meaning
0.00%:  was that
0.00%:  that's me not making a
0.00%:  this again
0.00%:  I think it was more of an image in
0.00%:  that one time I was eating a
0.00%:  that's coming from pain
0.00%:  it's not making it
0.00%:  I swear that one time
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a mean
0.00%:  it's time for that
0.01%:  it's time for that conf
0.00%:  now I'm making it so it
0.00%:  I'm now certain of these
0.00%:  I think it's now a

0.00%:  I think I'm far too awesome
0.00%:  again I'm not certain what
0.00%:  I'm not gonna see him paint it
0.00%:  I am most certain that if
0.00%:  I'm a ninja for
0.00%:  I keep that one a secret in
0.00%:  I know for a fact the one
0.00%:  I'm not certain I was taking the
0.00%:  that work
0.00%:  the one time I was in front
0.00%:  the one time I was in front of an
0.00%:  I meant in terms of paint
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing a pon
0.00%:  I can paint from
0.00%:  that was a frame
0.00%:  I promise I'm not to
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint it now that
0.00%:  I think it's time for a new tape
0.00%:  per
0.00%:  I'm not the one I
0.00%:  I'm not the one I was
0.00%:  it was of an emotion

0.00%:  I'm making it worse at
0.00%:  either I'm not as
0.00%:  that was in paint
0.00%:  it's time for me to paint again once
0.00%:  I think if it were me

0.00%:  at no point am I making
0.00%:  I'm certain it was the one time
0.00%:  I'm whisper

0.00%:  now I can't paint for at
0.00%:  it was on a game

0.00%:  that's one for me
0.00%:  that I'm secret
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it a secret to
0.00%:  I'm not seeing how it
0.00%:  I'm not writing fan fiction on

0.00%:  he was c
0.01%:  he was caption
0.00%:  in other news I'm a giant
0.00%:  I'm so aware that I

0.00%:  I'm most certain the point
0.00%:  most of it
0.00%:  I know neither can paint.
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can make it not
0.00%:  now it's confirm
0.00%:  there's no point in making a fine
0.00%:  it's time for me to pack it
0.00%:  I'm not forcing this
0.00%:  now I can't forget that I
0.00%:  I think it's facing

0.00%:  I won't paint again after this joke
0.00%:  I can't paint when

0.00%:  not to mention he's wearing a c
0.01%:  not to mention he's wearing a cape.
0.00%:  I'm gonna make the point
0.00%:  I want to keep in
0.00%:  I'm content knowing this
0.00%:  I'm not an imp
0.00%:  I imagine I'm the first one

0.00%:  I think I owe some of
0.00%:  I swear I'm not gonna eat paint
0.00%:  I now see the point
0.00%:  I went to paint him
0.00%:  I think if I can get past
0.00%:  that's not an image I care
0.00%:  I went into theatre
0.00%:  none of that is e
0.00%:  I know that I'm acting
0.00%:  then I went on an eating
0.00%:  if that's not an ego trip I
0.00%:  I'm resting
0.00%:  now I'm certain if someone
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can win the

0.00%:  now I'm ten again. I
0.00%:  if I paint one thing
0.00%:  I'm not gonna joke
0.00%:  I can see into
0.00%:  I can't erase that image now
0.00%:  it's time for him
0.00%:  I think we're in a coffee

0.00%:  I'm not seeing him in
0.00%:  it was on the page
0.00%:  I meant to paint him on a rock
0.00%:  there's no point making a face
0.00%:  someone once
0.00%:  I can't imagine I was that
0.00%:  once that's known
0.00%:  then I want some
0.00%:  I'm not gonna sit there

0.01%:  I know none of them can paint
0.00%:  I think it was in a tree
0.00%:  I'm the smart one again
0.00%:  at the risk of opening a
0.00%:  at the risk of opening a new
0.00%:  I know it's not ninja them

0.00%:  that part I'm not so
0.00%:  I am not certain who I am speaking to.
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna write a nice
0.00%:  I think for once in
0.00%:  I'm certain nothing of
0.00%:  I was forcing it into the
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that crime
0.00%:  I think I'm winning at parent

0.00%:  I wanna keep that one a secret.
0.00%:  I wanna keep that one a secret if
0.00%:  I know that one's a crime
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint some non

0.00%:  if I stop now I
0.00%:  I'm against the
0.00%:  none of these were conf
0.00%:  that means I'm now forcing
0.00%:  now I'm not certain again.
0.00%:  I'm the one making it worse

0.00%:  I know in the past
0.00%:  now I'm gonna point
0.00%:  I fear I can
0.00%:  if I paint again I think someone
0.00%:  now I'm seeing if I can make that into an
0.00%:  we're in.
0.00%:  I'm certain somehow
0.00%:  not the one from ancient
0.00%:  I know I'm not a painter that can
0.00%:  it was after paint night
0.00%:  I think we're facing a
0.00%:  I think none of it was in

0.00%:  there it is again on
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna frame this
0.00%:  I keep that image in a frame in

0.00%:  I know it's not a perfect nin
0.00%:  I know more than fifteen
0.00%:  I work at the
0.00%:  in that respect I know
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it so there
0.00%:  it's fine now
0.00%:  I'm at peace knowing this.
0.00%:  since I'm a teen
0.00%:  since I'm a teenage
0.00%:  we're on the same team
0.00%:  I know I'm not pain

0.00%:  I'm not certain I wanna see the
0.00%:  I can't wait to paint more in
0.00%:  I'm none too certain that wasn
0.00%:  I'm knowing this for a fact.
0.00%:  from now on it's time
0.00%:  I'm the jerk
0.00%:  I'm certain no one wants me to paint.
0.00%:  now part
0.00%:  I know he can paint so
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna remain pain
0.00%:  in case I'm forget

0.00%:  now I can't speak for
0.00%:  I know I'm the racist
0.00%:  if it were an
0.00%:  I think ninjas get
0.00%:  I'm somehow not certain if
0.00%:  now I'm speaking at the
0.00%:  now that I'm open
0.00%:  I'm not writing that one off as
0.00%:  now I'm gonna post
0.00%:  from that point in time on I
0.00%:  I'm since
0.00%:  I think I can stop after
0.00%:  now I'm making porn
0.00%:  I think I'm not at peace
0.00%:  I am now certain I'm not gonna paint
0.00%:  I'm gonna see him in
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna frame
0.00%:  I forgot to take a nap
0.00%:  the reason I'm not keeping in
0.00%:  now I'm gonna frame this conf
0.00%:  I know that from seeing
0.00%:  I think after a
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna paint this one time
0.00%:  I'm not a ninja either
0.00%:  in fact I might
0.00%:  I was gonna paint a more
0.00%:  we're on the tape
0.00%:  if I'm not wearing a mask
0.00%:  insert foot
0.00%:  then I ate an entire cookie
0.00%:  it's gonna take more than n
0.00%:  reg
0.00%:  I'm wearing the ninja mask too.
0.00%:  that one's gonna take time
0.00%:  I'm not great at the
0.00%:  now I can't imagine paint
0.00%:  I'm the first woman
0.00%:  I was int
0.00%:  I'm keeping that in front
0.01%:  I'm keeping that in front of me as

0.00%:  if I were to paint that one again I
0.00%:  I know I'm not ret
0.00%:  I can't seem to win
0.00%:  I am now at the age
0.00%:  I know it's them
0.00%:  on that note I'm gonna paint fewer faces in
0.00%:  again I'm not certain if I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna swap
0.00%:  here's me facing
0.00%:  I mean it wasn
0.00%:  I'm not gonna make that point
0.00%:  I'm not one of the great
0.00%:  I want to remain on this
0.00%:  one of the paint
0.00%:  I'm most certain I hate
0.00%:  I mean I was fifteen
0.00%:  I can't imagine a painter of his
0.00%:  I mean the cartoon. I'm not
0.00%:  I'm acting the
0.00%:  I'm acting the part
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that secret now in
0.00%:  I was gonna paint him more
0.00%:  then I went on to make a name
0.00%:  I'm not an artist if
0.00%:  I think it's time I forget
0.00%:  that's gonna make one
0.00%:  I'm not a teen

0.00%:  now I'm gonna see if I can fit that
0.00%:  as of now I'm certain

0.00%:  I know I'm a piece of shit
0.00%:  we're in the past again. I
0.00%:  I'm certain it was one I
0.00%:  I'm certain none of it was meant in
0.00%:  I think I got a 
0.00%:  one time I forgot I was in
0.00%:  I'm waiting for that to make
0.00%:  I know he's in a
0.00%:  I know that comes from an
0.00%:  it's worth noting I meant
0.00%:  I won't make that promise if
0.00%:  I think I can sort
0.00%:  I think I can sort of imagine
0.00%:  I think I mean after
0.00%:  I know it's not a perfect image of a
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that safe
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that safe in
0.00%:  I think I'm wearing some paint
0.00%:  I think I own a
0.00%:  I was not great
0.00%:  I know that time I
0.00%:  now he's a giant
0.00%:  I'm eating paint now
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna er
0.01%:  no I'm not gonna erase that
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna erase it.
0.00%:  that means I write fiction
0.00%:  if I paint now it's gonna make
0.00%:  I can't think of a more point
0.00%:  I want to see it
0.00%:  I want to see it again.
0.00%:  I'm certain at the
0.00%:  I'm certain at the time I was
0.00%:  I'm certain at the time I knew
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to paint in
0.00%:  no I'm not hearing
0.00%:  it was on rice
0.00%:  I can promise one thing to
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can paint him one
0.00%:  part of me wants that
0.00%:  I'm wearing a space
0.00%:  I know I'm not the one sitting
0.00%:  I'm not so keen
0.00%:  I can't wait for some of
0.00%:  his c
0.00%:  I mention this fact
0.00%:  I think it's time for nap town
0.00%:  now it's time for me to pe
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it so we
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint if
0.00%:  I swear I'm not gonna think
0.00%:  that one time on
0.00%:  he's wearing a tank top. I
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna face it now
0.00%:  I know I can't name the one
0.00%:  I want one of those nin
0.00%:  I want to make it 
0.00%:  now I can't paint either one again
0.00%:  now I'm staring into the face of pain
0.00%:  it was magic paint.
0.00%:  I'm not writing that on a
0.00%:  from this point we
0.00%:  from this point we can
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint on more
0.00%:  I'm fine if we keep that to
0.00%:  I'm gonna wait for him to speak
0.00%:  no I'm not gonna swear
0.00%:  here I was gonna make
0.00%:  here I was gonna make a point
0.00%:  if none of this came
0.00%:  I'm gonna paste that
0.00%:  I'm eating an entire can of peas
0.00%:  I'm acting as if I knew
0.00%:  I'm aware of the non
0.00%:  I think a person
0.00%:  I think a person can
0.00%:  I can't imagine what par
0.00%:  that was a perfect moment
0.00%:  that was a perfect moment in
0.00%:  again he
0.00%:  I went too fast
0.00%:  I'm gonna see how far I can make it into
0.00%:  he was green. I'm not
0.00%:  I think it was mean
0.00%:  the point I was making to
0.00%:  now there's a moment I
0.00%:  that name was taken
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna tear some
0.00%:  I mean it in the awesome
0.00%:  I want him to remain
0.00%:  I was gonna offer him
0.00%:  I got the ninja part in
0.00%:  now he's in front of me.
0.00%:  now I can't think of an easier
0.00%:  that's now making me re
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I want someone in
0.00%:  I'm at peace knowing that from
0.00%:  that's it for making conf
0.00%:  it was part of one
0.00%:  I mean that one'
0.00%:  I mean that one's name
0.00%:  I know I'm gonna paint that scene in
0.00%:  from now on I can't paint again.
0.00%:  I'm in for some
0.00%:  forcing
0.00%:  it's the one time I know
0.00%:  it's gonna take nin
0.00%:  I keep meaning to write the fan
0.00%:  now I'm forcing this into a met
0.00%:  I know it means nothing at
0.00%:  I hope I'm not off
0.00%:  since I'm at it I might
0.00%:  I'm gonna eat some nach
0.00%:  I'm perfect now
0.00%:  I'm sne
0.00%:  now it's the morning
0.00%:  I'm gonna scrape that one
0.00%:  I can imagine the master pain
0.00%:  it makes me not
0.00%:  it makes me not wanna
0.00%:  we're at the point I can
0.00%:  we're gonna stop it
0.00%:  now I'm seeking comfort
0.00%:  then I'm certain of
0.00%:  I can't imagine a time when pain
0.00%:  I know I'm not fine
0.00%:  I'm not certain what goes into
0.00%:  I think we're casting
0.00%:  that's an em
0.00%:  I mean it in terms of the
0.00%:  I'm not certain I knew the name
0.00%:  I know for a fact I meant to paint in
0.00%:  it was on the cere
0.00%:  I'm the master of
0.00%:  I was meaning to paint it more
0.00%:  I think I can paint it now.
0.00%:  that non
0.00%:  I want to make this a
0.00%:  tearing
0.00%:  this time I know
0.00%:  this time I know I'm not
0.00%:  actions are
0.00%:  at this point I know I'm on
0.00%:  of that I am
0.00%:  of that I am certain
0.00%:  I forgot it in a
0.00%:  I think once we
0.00%:  I'm making the case for paint
0.00%:  I'm not keeping it a secret at
0.00%:  I won't repeat that on
0.00%:  I can't stop wanting to make
0.00%:  then I ran off into
0.00%:  I think I'm more into acting
0.00%:  since I'm taking the time
0.00%:  we're not gonna mention that as
0.00%:  no it's not a met
0.00%:  I'm now sitting here in a
0.00%:  I am now certain I'm not speaking in the
0.00%:  I know that in case
0.00%:  I'm gonna make a point of it when
0.00%:  I know he's not gonna care if
0.00%:  I sort of think I'm coming
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint it in
0.00%:  that name was a
0.00%:  I'm waiting for him to snap
0.00%:  I am now certain that I'm not one
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep it in this
0.00%:  I'm not tracing the
0.00%:  I'm not an artist when
0.00%:  I can't stop there now
0.00%:  I'm not gonna paint him now
0.00%:  I can't imagine what I meant.
0.00%:  I'm writing a fan fiction to
0.00%:  hear
0.00%:  I can't wait for time
0.00%:  I think it's more of an image in
0.00%:  there's none of it
0.00%:  there's none of it coming
0.00%:  no matter what I imagine I
0.00%:  I'm certain of it when I see
0.00%:  I swear I'm gonna make a
0.00%:  I'm keeping that first one in
0.00%:  I know for a fact it's nothing
0.00%:  now I'm certain I am nothing
0.01%:  now I'm certain I am nothing if not a
0.00%:  I'm fine with a
0.00%:  that's now off
0.00%:  I can imagine that now
0.00%:  I'm aware it changes
0.00%:  I can make these
0.00%:  the precise
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep at
0.00%:  I'm certain of it when I imagine
0.00%:  I'm not gonna write it on a
0.00%:  I think we're eating at
0.00%:  I was making the perfect
0.00%:  on that note I'm taking a nap in
0.00%:  I can imagine no worse fate in the
0.00%:  I'm gonna see if I can throw in
0.00%:  I know I'm the captain
0.00%:  I think once again it was
0.00%:  then I was a giant
0.00%:  at this point I'm facing
0.00%:  that's a project
0.00%:  I can't paint a horse.
0.00%:  now it's time again for me
0.00%:  I know for a fact that means
0.00%:  from this point I'm not
0.00%:  I'm not gonna see that in
0.01%:  I'm not gonna see that in print
0.00%:  I know that's ironic.
0.00%:  it's gonna take nine
0.00%:  I know I'm trash
0.00%:  on that note I am forcing
0.00%:  at one point I was eating
0.00%:  I think one reason I'm a
0.00%:  there's no two
0.00%:  I know I'm not a fan
0.00%:  if one of them was
0.00%:  it was meant to hang in a room
0.00%:  I knew none of this meant
0.00%:  now I'm certain of this.
0.00%:  I'm not certain if I mean his
0.00%:  on that note I sinc
0.00%:  that means I can't win at
0.00%:  I can promise one thing if
0.00%:  I'm not a fan of either.
0.00%:  I'm not that great of a ninja.
0.00%:  I'm certain the paint is now
0.00%:  at some point in there I came
0.00%:  I'm not making an effort to see
0.00%:  I can imagine that I'm not
0.00%:  that one's not gonna make me
0.00%:  I wanna take this one
0.00%:  I promise I'm not facing a
0.00%:  I'm after the
0.00%:  in that respect I imagine
0.00%:  now I think I'm free to go paint
0.00%:  I think I'm once again off
0.00%:  it's time for me to join a
0.00%:  it's time for me to join a new
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint it once
0.00%:  it was a print.
0.00%:  I promise I won't mention that nine
0.00%:  I know I'm not so certain
0.00%:  I think I'm an awesome painter in fact
0.00%:  I meant to mention in case
0.00%:  at some point I think I can
0.00%:  that was a poor
0.00%:  that was a poor conf
0.00%:  there's no point in making me into a new

0.00%:  now I am certain these
0.00%:  that one's recent
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna swear a
0.00%:  I am the ninja master
0.00%:  then I wrote fan fiction set
0.00%:  I am not in fact a painter who
0.00%:  it's one of the few cart
0.00%:  I'm certain I want to see
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to get
0.00%:  I ate an entire cake that
0.00%:  now that I mention it again I'm a
0.00%:  watch
0.00%:  I think it's time for paint n
0.00%:  worst conf
0.00%:  I imagine that came off
0.00%:  I'm gonna paint one of these in
0.00%:  it was green paint on the
0.00%:  now that i
0.00%:  I'm now certain things
0.00%:  I can't see if
0.00%:  if that's not canon I
0.00%:  I think it's on a piece
0.00%:  I'm gonna make it into a t
0.00%:  now I'm the one making a conf
0.00%:  I was gonna mention that I'm fine
0.00%:  part of it was on
0.00%:  he was re
0.00%:  I was nine or ten at the time. I
0.00%:  I res
0.00%:  it's not fair that I can
0.00%:  somehow after
0.00%:  it was on a tank
0.00%:  I was coming in
0.00%:  I was coming in from
0.00%:  I sort of can't imagine him
0.00%:  I mean that one in
0.00%:  after this I can't go
0.00%:  I know he isn't canon
0.00%:  at some point I mention
0.00%:  it's an anime
0.00%:  when it came time to take
0.00%:  now I'm sitting in a heap
0.00%:  once again I know more
0.00%:  I'm not certain the man
0.00%:  I swear I'm not n
0.01%:  I swear I'm not naming the
0.00%:  I swear I'm not naming a
0.00%:  the painter's gonna
0.00%:  I'm not sharing a piece
0.00%:  I'm not gonna repeat it to
0.00%:  I'm not gonna repeat it to make
0.00%:  I think I can paint now too
0.00%:  on that note I imagine I'm
0.00%:  that was me again.
0.00%:  that's not a point for me
0.00%:  there's a joke at
0.00%:  there was a jet pack in
0.00%:  then I ate a few cookies
0.00%:  none of that went into
0.00%:  it was no more
0.00%:  it was no more than 
0.00%:  it was no more than fifteen
0.00%:  most of that conf
0.00%:  I know I'm a master of nothing.
0.00%:  I think at some point after I conf
0.00%:  there was a '
0.00%:  I promise I'm not gonna take it with
0.00%:  I'm gonna keep that in front of me as an
0.00%:  I know I can't paint those
0.00%:  I think I won't name names after
0.00%:  now I can't imagine a paint
0.00%:  I am nothing if not awesome.
0.00%:  I want him to go
0.00%:  that one was of
0.00%:  I am aware this pain
0.00%:  I can't imagine an answer
0.00%:  I won't mention his name again once
0.00%:  now it's time to make another
0.00%:  I'm making an honest effort not
0.00%:  I wanna paint nin
0.00%:  in fact I'm not 
0.00%:  none of that is a joke in ret
0.00%:  I keep meaning to conf
0.00%:  that's canon for now
0.00%:  I'm certain that I mean to
0.00%:  I'm not insane either
0.00%:  I can't stop ram
0.00%:  I can't forget to mention he was in an
0.00%:  there's a moment in
0.00%:  I know one other
0.00%:  I'm not a master of paint
0.00%:  it was on a one
0.00%:  there was a caption making
0.00%:  that means I'm grown
0.00%:  I think I'm an actor in
0.00%:  now it's certain I
0.00%:  I think I meant to paint a finger
0.00%:  I think no one can paint it worse
0.00%:  I think I sorta wanna
0.00%:  I'm wearing skin
0.00%:  acting as if that weren
0.00%:  can we agree that I'm not an
0.00%:  I think I meant it more fig
0.00%:  in front of me I
0.00%:  one thing I'm certain of is if
0.00%:  I'm not into making the
0.00%:  I can't imagine a painter who is
0.00%:  I know there's a conf
0.00%:  I'm certain it was too
0.00%:  I'm not certain if it was of a
0.00%:  I am aware I am not
0.00%:  I promise I won't make one again
0.00%:  I'm seeing if I can make the
0.00%:  I'm not gonna confirm it if
0.00%:  I know none of this fact
0.00%:  I am not winning
0.00%:  at no point was that
0.00%:  that's now more
0.00%:  I think it was more of an image I
0.00%:  now I'm making so
0.00%:  I'm not gonna mention after
0.00%:  I think I spent more time on wanting
0.00%:  I spent that time
0.00%:  there was no face.
0.00%:  now I am certain I am no
0.00%:  he's wearing mic
0.00%:  it was the cartoon image
0.00%:  I know I'm racist.
0.00%:  that was more of a mon
0.00%:  now I'm into it
0.01%:  now I'm into it again
0.00%:  if I were to mention the fact
0.00%:  I think I care to
0.00%:  I forget to mention it'
0.00%:  I was gonna trace
0.00%:  it's canon for me that
0.00%:  that means I'm working at
0.00%:  now I'm the one sitting
0.00%:  it was on an air
0.00%:  in case that image
0.00%:  I see I'm not
0.00%:  it's on that
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna paint a mon
0.00%:  I'm not certain if the same
0.00%:  I think I'm time to
0.00%:  I wanna keep this from
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna write someone
0.00%:  as a matter of fact he'
0.00%:  I ate the entire can of pain
0.00%:  now I am opening
0.00%:  I think now I can imagine
0.00%:  I was certain of it then
0.00%:  we can agree that no one
0.00%:  I'm sort of meaning to paint
0.00%:  I'm not certain speaking that
0.00%:  now I'm certain none of that is meant
0.00%:  I'm gonna wait to see if I can paint
0.00%:  I might want to paint more.
0.00%:  now I'm gonna stick to
0.00%:  I'm awesome too
0.00%:  now I'm safe
0.00%:  I knew that on

0.00%:  we're at this
0.00%:  we're at this point again
0.00%:  that means I win too
0.00%:  now I imagine if
0.00%:  I think I want some more pe
0.00%:  I was not certain that
0.00%:  it's a crime I
0.00%:  I'm not acting as if I know
0.00%:  I'm certain that if we go
0.00%:  I think it's time for me to I
0.00%:  it's a certain
0.00%:  I know it's neither a
0.01%:  I know it's neither a conf
0.00%:  I'm making another of
0.00%:  the parent
0.00%:  I won't open
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna stare at it

0.00%:  I forgot the ninja's name.
0.00%:  I promise I won't make that fact
0.00%:  I think I'm gonna wait on master
0.00%:  I think I'm sort of winning
0.00%:  I know it's not fair to him if
0.00%:  that's me taken
0.00%:  for once I am
0.00%:  we're not seeing that
0.00%:  I am the king
0.00%:  I forgot the ninja name
