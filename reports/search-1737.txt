0.14%:  what'
0.32%:  what's that
0.25%:  what's the
0.65%:  what's the worst
0.24%:  what's the point
0.14%:  that the body treats it
0.14%:  that I don't star
0.14%:  then I start
0.14%:  that's what the dentist saw!
0.14%:  that's why I spend
0.14%:  that's what I was planning to do in that
0.14%:  that the parts
0.14%:  that I don't taste it
0.14%:  that the way
0.14%:  that the answer to this
0.14%:  that that doesn't stop
0.14%:  that's the way this
0.14%:  that it's been
0.14%:  then spit!
0.14%:  don't eat
0.14%:  that's not to say that this
0.14%:  that's what I spent this
0.14%:  that despite that
0.14%:  that I don't wash away
0.14%:  that it doesn't spray
0.14%:  breathe
0.14%:  that it doesn't wash past
0.14%:  it doesn't bother
0.14%:  that's what they said on
0.14%:  that's the best way to do
0.14%:  that it doesn't R
0.14%:  that there's no way it
0.14%:  that's how I spent today!
0.14%:  that I don't pass away
0.14%:  that that's the reason
0.14%:  that that's where poison
0.14%:  that the bad
0.14%:  that this story
0.16%:  that this story ends
0.14%:  that wasn
0.14%:  that this doesn't at

0.13%:  that starts
0.13%:  that it's not the sort
0.13%:  that the best
0.13%:  that there's a handy
0.13%:  don't bother
0.13%:  that doesn't pose
0.13%:  that said
0.13%:  that's what I started
0.13%:  that's RE
0.13%:  that I don't stop bath
0.13%:  that water doesn't wash it away at
0.13%:  that's what the dentist was y
0.13%:  that's why we
0.13%:  that's what that was
0.13%:  that I possess the
0.13%:  there's a
0.13%:  that there's a tiny
0.13%:  that this does
0.13%:  that I don't start with a
0.13%:  that this was
0.13%:  that it doesn't wash away at the
0.13%:  that's the best that
0.13%:  that other
0.13%:  that it's spread that
0.13%:  that doesn't wash it
0.13%:  that was pretty
0.13%:  those are both
0.13%:  what's with
0.38%:  what's with that
0.12%:  don't start
0.28%:  don't start with
0.20%:  don't start with that
0.12%:  that I don't piss
0.12%:  that it's not as
0.15%:  that it's not as bad
0.12%:  that was the best
0.12%:  that that stops
0.12%:  that this has any
0.12%:  that's it:
0.12%:  that's today
0.12%:  that's the way the
0.12%:  that the poison that'
0.12%:  that it stays there and that
0.12%:  then I wash
0.12%:  that D
0.12%:  that we're both
0.12%:  that's what I spent the day
0.12%:  that I had
0.12%:  that I was born this
0.12%:  that it doesn't wear away
0.12%:  that the story
0.12%:  that's the end
0.12%:  that it doesn't taste as
0.12%:  that that doesn't raise
0.12%:  that I stop
0.12%:  that the dose
0.12%:  that's what today
0.12%:  that's not why
0.12%:  there's not
0.12%:  that's when
0.13%:  that's when I started
0.12%:  that this doesn't set
0.12%:  that I don't start tw
0.12%:  that's how I started the
0.12%:  that I don't breath it
0.12%:  that doesn't wash it away
0.12%:  that it doesn't throw
0.12%:  that's how I start
0.12%:  that no
0.12%:  that it has no
0.12%:  that the poison sett
0.12%:  that's what dentist
0.12%:  that parts
0.12%:  that's not the worst way this
0.12%:  that water doesn't wash it away that
0.12%:  that's pretty d
0.12%:  that's what the rest
0.12%:  that that's what I do
0.12%:  that I don't share that
0.12%:  that's not what we
0.12%:  that that's the way dent
0.12%:  that's not how that
0.12%:  that's way
0.29%:  that's way better
0.50%:  that's way better than what
4.16%:  that's way better than what I was planning
3.92%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do!
2.23%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do:
0.66%:  that's way better than what I was planning!
0.31%:  that's way better than what I was planning:

0.14%:  that's way better than how
0.12%:  that's way better than what I was planning: to
0.12%:  that's way better than sp
0.12%:  that I won
0.32%:  that I won't start
0.20%:  that I won't die
0.20%:  that I won't be
0.11%:  that the body has
0.11%:  that nobody'
0.11%:  that's not the worst idea
0.11%:  that's as
0.11%:  that's why I want
0.11%:  that I start with
0.11%:  that is why
0.11%:  that what the
0.11%:  that it doesn't stop at
0.11%:  that I do it
0.11%:  that that was
0.11%:  that the worst
0.25%:  that the worst that
0.11%:  that's a L
0.11%:  that I don't bother
0.11%:  that it's not passed
0.11%:  that was the best part
0.11%:  that's yet
0.11%:  that there wasn
0.11%:  that's not that hard
0.11%:  that the dentist who says I
0.11%:  don't spit!
0.11%:  that the poison that stays
0.11%:  that I don't step
0.11%:  that I don't start with the
0.11%:  that doesn't stop it
0.11%:  that when the
0.11%:  that there's no way to pass
0.15%:  that there's no way to pass this
0.11%:  that to
0.11%:  that the dentist was a spy
0.11%:  that's why there
0.11%:  that's not what I do at
0.11%:  that there's not a way
0.11%:  that hasn
0.11%:  that when it
0.17%:  that when it starts
0.11%:  that it's spread that way to
0.11%:  that's what I want to be
0.11%:  that's not the worst way that
0.11%:  that the word
0.11%:  that doesn't set
0.10%:  then I spit that
0.10%:  that isn't how
0.10%:  that it doesn't par
0.10%:  that when that
0.25%:  that when that stops
0.10%:  that there's not a way that
0.10%:  that that's where I
0.10%:  that it's not wasted
0.10%:  that's not that bad
0.10%:  that I don't hate
0.10%:  that's how the story
0.15%:  that's how the story ends:
0.10%:  that does
0.10%:  that that is the
0.10%:  now
0.32%:  now that
0.11%:  now that I'
0.10%:  that's why when
0.10%:  that it's not the worst way
0.10%:  that it wasn
0.10%:  that's how I spent today:
0.10%:  that's not as
0.10%:  that's what the dentist says:
0.10%:  that that's the way poison
0.10%:  that's what they do on
0.10%:  that it stops there and
0.10%:  that it doesn't we
0.10%:  that's why dent
0.10%:  that I'd be
0.10%:  that doesn't show
0.10%:  that it's not spread to
0.10%:  that's what this was
0.10%:  don't spit that
0.10%:  that's a pretty he
0.10%:  that I wash that
0.10%:  that's another way to
0.10%:  that doesn't stop with
0.10%:  that there's a way to stop this
0.10%:  that's the best part! I
0.10%:  that's the way I want
0.10%:  that this doesn't pose
0.10%:  that that's how I spend
0.10%:  that's what it says
0.10%:  that it has that
0.10%:  that I don't D
0.10%:  that's sort
0.10%:  that that doesn't wash
0.12%:  that that doesn't wash away
0.10%:  that that's as
0.10%:  that there's not way
0.10%:  that there isn't a way
0.24%:  that there isn't a way that
0.10%:  that the reason
0.10%:  that's what that taste
0.12%:  that's what that taste was
0.10%:  that the poison has stayed
0.10%:  that doesn't wash away with sp
0.10%:  that it stays there and po
0.10%:  that's been
0.10%:  that's what it does
0.10%:  that part is
0.10%:  that's not what I was planning today!
0.10%:  that that doesn't start
0.10%:  it doesn't pass
0.10%:  that the dose stays
0.10%:  that's better!
0.10%:  that this doesn't pre
0.10%:  that that's where it
0.75%:  that that's where it stays
0.12%:  that that's where it stays and
0.10%:  that's better than a
0.10%:  that doesn't start with
0.09%:  that doesn't wash away!
0.09%:  that isn't the
0.13%:  that isn't the worst
0.09%:  then throw
0.09%:  throat!
0.09%:  that isn't a bad
0.09%:  that's where I stand with
0.09%:  that doesn't show that
0.09%:  that I was born with the
0.09%:  that is the
0.11%:  that is the story
0.09%:  that it doesn't wash away to
0.09%:  that I don't bother with
0.09%:  that's not where
0.09%:  that's not a dirty
0.09%:  it doesn't taste
0.09%:  that doesn't at
0.09%:  that I don't start h
0.09%:  that the poison stays R
0.09%:  that's way better than what was
0.09%:  that's what they said I
0.09%:  that I don't breathe that
0.09%:  that they're poison
0.09%:  that's what we want
0.09%:  that's what I do when
0.09%:  that I do this at
0.09%:  that's how today
0.09%:  that's another way that I
0.09%:  that I don't pass it to
0.09%:  that when I start
0.09%:  that I stay this
0.09%:  that that's the best way I
0.09%:  that's how I spend the
0.09%:  that I don't start bath
0.09%:  that there's no stat
0.09%:  that's the answer
0.09%:  that's the answer to that
0.09%:  that I won't pass
0.09%:  that with
0.09%:  I don
0.09%:  that's what that weird
0.12%:  that's what that weird taste
0.09%:  that the poison's a
0.09%:  that that's the way to
0.09%:  that's not hard
0.09%:  that's what a
0.09%:  that I don't try to wash the
0.09%:  that it doesn't waste
0.09%:  that's not a bad way to start this
0.09%:  Y
0.09%:  that poison has the
0.09%:  that a tiny
0.09%:  that that poison stays
0.09%:  it's not that bad
0.09%:  that said teeth
0.09%:  that's how that went
0.09%:  that's the day
0.09%:  that that's not weird!
0.09%:  that rad
0.09%:  that isn't that
0.09%:  I don't start
0.09%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: sp
0.09%:  that at
0.09%:  that it's AL
0.22%:  that it's ALREAD
0.09%:  that's what we do with
0.09%:  that the poison starts at
0.09%:  that that's the sort
0.09%:  that it doesn't stab
0.08%:  that's what I was planning to say!
0.08%:  that it doesn't sap
0.08%:  that I don't wash it away!
0.08%:  that that's the way I
0.08%:  that I don't bite
0.08%:  that there's not this
0.08%:  that I don't start planning
0.08%:  that's what they said!
0.08%:  that that doesn't bother
0.08%:  that that's where it stops
0.08%:  that this doesn't taste
0.08%:  that it won
0.10%:  that it won't spread
0.08%:  with
0.08%:  that the person stab
0.08%:  that by the
0.08%:  then eat
0.08%:  that's what I was planning to do at this
0.12%:  that's what I was planning to do at this party
0.08%:  that's what I was planning to do in the past
0.08%:  that's where I stand!
0.08%:  that that's a better
0.08%:  yeah
0.08%:  that's what the dentist was planning!
0.08%:  that's not how it
0.08%:  that there's as
0.08%:  that it does what
0.08%:  that this story doesn
0.08%:  that it doesn't w
0.08%:  that it doesn't st
0.08%:  what the
0.08%:  that I don't eat a
0.08%:  that I want
0.08%:  that I stand
0.08%:  that what's in
0.08%:  hands
0.08%:  that that's what we do
0.08%:  that they don't stop
0.08%:  that I sp
0.08%:  that these two
0.08%:  that's not what I was planning at
0.08%:  that there's tons
0.08%:  that I don't wash away that
0.08%:  that its
0.08%:  that I stay that
0.08%:  that I don't pay
0.08%:  don't throw
0.08%:  that's what I say
0.08%:  that's the third
0.08%:  that it ends
0.08%:  that I don't possess the
0.08%:  that's based
0.13%:  that's based on the
0.09%:  that's based on what
0.08%:  that shows
0.08%:  that's what this day
0.08%:  that's what this post
0.09%:  that's what this post was
0.08%:  that poison stays there
0.08%:  it doesn't stop
0.08%:  that's not what I do with
0.08%:  that that's how we
0.08%:  that I don't possess a
0.08%:  that's what that dent
0.22%:  that's what that dentist was planning
0.08%:  that's another way I
0.08%:  that's not how this
0.08%:  that the other
0.08%:  that poetry
0.08%:  that's why it tastes
0.08%:  that was a
0.33%:  that was a pretty
0.08%:  that dentist'
0.08%:  that this doesn't throw
0.08%:  that that isn
0.10%:  that that isn't a
0.08%:  that's not a bad theory
0.08%:  that spray
0.08%:  that the poison has a
0.08%:  throat and
0.08%:  they don
0.35%:  they don't wash
0.16%:  they don't start
0.12%:  they don't wash that
0.08%:  that's how I spent the day:
0.08%:  I'd
0.49%:  I'd better
0.22%:  I'd better stop
0.10%:  I'd better not
0.08%:  that I spend
0.08%:  that it's not AL
0.16%:  that it's not ALREAD
0.08%:  that when I say that
0.08%:  that the taste
0.08%:  that's a pretty s
0.08%:  that this doesn't we
0.08%:  that's what I was planning to do with any
0.08%:  that there's no way what
0.08%:  that this won't stop
0.08%:  don't pass
0.08%:  body
0.08%:  that when it passes
0.08%:  that water doesn't wash away this
0.08%:  then that'
0.25%:  then that's what
0.11%:  then that's why
0.11%:  then that's how
0.09%:  then that's it
0.08%:  that I don't waste the
0.08%:  that's an aw
0.08%:  that's what this body
0.08%:  that it doesn't wash away as
0.08%:  that the body treats it as
0.08%:  that's not to say that what
0.08%:  that the phrase
0.08%:  that I don't wait
0.08%:  that's what they said at
0.08%:  that I don't start sw
0.08%:  that's how I want
0.08%:  that the answer to that
0.08%:  on
0.09%:  on that
0.07%:  that I want to be
0.07%:  now that I say
0.59%:  now that I say that
0.07%:  that I don't start to sweat
0.07%:  that I don't say this
0.07%:  that it's as pot
0.07%:  that I wash the
0.07%:  that when it'
0.07%:  that's part
0.07%:  that that was the
0.07%:  that the part
0.07%:  that the stories
0.07%:  that that's how I stay
0.07%:  that what that
0.07%:  that the dentist has a
0.07%:  that it doesn't at
0.07%:  what's with dent
0.07%:  that the way that
0.07%:  then stab
0.07%:  that was today
0.07%:  that's what I was planning to do this year
0.07%:  that's what that weird taste was
0.07%:  that the poison stays at
0.07%:  that's how I stay
0.07%:  that's what I was planning to do:
0.07%:  don't breath
0.07%:  that's where this
0.07%:  that I was born with teeth
0.07%:  breath
0.07%:  that by this
0.07%:  that was a pretty bad
0.07%:  that's the answer to why
0.07%:  that's with
0.07%:  that I don't start p
0.07%:  that doesn't wear away
0.07%:  don't spit the
0.07%:  that's the worst way
0.07%:  that that's not the worst way I
0.07%:  that there's so
0.07%:  that the path
0.07%:  that was the day
0.08%:  that was the day that
0.07%:  that that's not weird at
0.07%:  that's way better than that
0.07%:  that's why I hate
0.07%:  that this won't destroy
0.07%:  by the
0.07%:  that's what it was
0.07%:  that it doesn't short
0.07%:  that the words
0.07%:  that's way better than how it was
0.07%:  that it's at
0.07%:  that it doesn't LE
0.07%:  that's not what I said
0.07%:  that it stays on there
0.07%:  that that's the best part
0.07%:  that that's a better way to do
0.07%:  that it doesn't wash the
0.07%:  that I breathe
0.07%:  that this was the
0.07%:  that I don't sweat it
0.07%:  that it's not as bad as the
0.07%:  that there is a
0.07%:  there's no way that that
0.07%:  that way
0.07%:  that there's no way to pass that
0.07%:  that's no
0.07%:  that's not how the
0.07%:  that this theory
0.07%:  that's what teeth do
0.07%:  those are two
0.07%:  that when this
0.07%:  that's not weird that
0.07%:  that's the other
0.07%:  that the two parts
0.07%:  that this doesn't short
0.07%:  at
0.07%:  what's the worst they
0.07%:  that the body is
0.07%:  that I do that at
0.07%:  that's where that
0.07%:  that I don't try to wash that
0.07%:  that the tiny
0.07%:  that it was the
0.07%:  that it doesn't per
0.07%:  that I pass
0.07%:  that I pass this
0.07%:  that it stands
0.07%:  that it's as easy
0.07%:  that's what parents
0.09%:  that's what parents do with
0.07%:  that's one way
0.07%:  at this
0.07%:  that's why I was
0.08%:  that's why I was born
0.07%:  that it's not so bad
0.12%:  that it's not so bad that
0.07%:  that an
0.07%:  that it doesn't phase
0.07%:  D
0.07%:  that I don't breathe at
0.07%:  what's the best
0.09%:  what's the best part
0.09%:  what's the best way to do
0.07%:  that what I say
0.07%:  that's the basis
0.07%:  that what they
0.07%:  that that's why dent
0.07%:  that tiny
0.07%:  what's better
0.33%:  what's better than that
0.07%:  that the dos
0.07%:  that's why I wash
0.07%:  that it won't spread to the
0.07%:  then the
0.07%:  that the dentist says I
0.07%:  that the story ends
0.07%:  that they don't taste
0.07%:  that doesn't pass
0.07%:  that it stays there! I
0.07%:  that's what has
0.07%:  that it's not hard
0.06%:  that's what I was planning to do pretty
0.06%:  that doesn't wash it away!
0.06%:  that's what they said I was
0.06%:  that's why I eat
0.06%:  that's why it tastes so bad
0.06%:  the best
3.20%:  the best part is that
0.50%:  the best part is that I don
0.43%:  the best part is that now
0.30%:  the best part is:
0.13%:  the best part is I
0.12%:  the best part:
0.11%:  the best part is that I was
0.20%:  the best part is that I was planning
0.14%:  the best part is that I was planning on
0.10%:  the best part is that now that
0.06%:  it's not a
0.06%:  that isn't the worst way
0.06%:  that dentist was
0.06%:  that it doesn't waste away
0.06%:  that's what teeth ARE
0.06%:  that's not what the word
0.06%:  that this has not
0.06%:  that there's no way a
0.06%:  that won
0.06%:  that that's the best way to ward
0.06%:  that they don't start to
0.06%:  what's better than that is
0.06%:  that I don't stress
0.06%:  it's not as
0.06%:  don't breathe!
0.06%:  that it's not based
0.06%:  what's better than a
0.06%:  that it doesn't rob
0.06%:  that that's poison
0.06%:  that that's not a weird way to be
0.06%:  there's no way that I
0.06%:  that's how I beat
0.06%:  that I don't share the
0.06%:  what's with these
0.06%:  that's better than what I was planning to do a
0.06%:  that it's what
0.06%:  don't say
0.18%:  don't say that
0.06%:  that I started with
0.06%:  that it's not water based
0.06%:  that it doesn't set
0.06%:  that's how I spent this day
0.06%:  that I don't sh
0.06%:  that what this
0.06%:  that's what I wanted
0.13%:  that's what I wanted to say
0.06%:  that two
0.06%:  that's the news
0.06%:  that the body stores
0.06%:  that's not bad at
0.06%:  that says
0.06%:  that that is a
0.06%:  so
0.09%:  so what
0.06%:  that the way to
0.06%:  that I say
0.06%:  the best part is I'
0.06%:  that it doesn't pass to the
0.06%:  that's what they said to
0.06%:  that's not a hard
0.06%:  that's the story I
0.06%:  that when I was
0.06%:  that it's not part
0.06%:  that that does
0.06%:  that's what I was planning!
0.06%:  that it spreads by
0.06%:  that this won't be the
0.06%:  that's not weird to
0.06%:  that I don't try this
0.06%:  that stays
0.10%:  that stays there
0.06%:  that the dentist who was
0.06%:  that there was poison
0.06%:  that by that
0.06%:  that it's not that easy
0.06%:  that I don't at
0.06%:  that's better than I
0.20%:  that's better than I was
0.14%:  that's better than I was planning
0.06%:  that's what we do in
0.06%:  that this doesn't betray
0.06%:  that's the point
0.06%:  that it's not RE
0.06%:  then spread
0.06%:  we
0.06%:  that there's a way to do
0.12%:  that there's a way to do that!
0.06%:  that's what I was planning to do the past
0.06%:  that death isn
0.06%:  that death isn't a
0.06%:  that's what they train
0.06%:  that it's stored
0.06%:  that teeth and
0.06%:  that's not to say this
0.06%:  that's what the dentist says! I
0.06%:  that that part
0.06%:  that it doesn't start by
0.06%:  that's what it says to
0.06%:  that the water
0.06%:  that's a pretty bad
0.06%:  that sp
1.12%:  that spit doesn't wash
1.21%:  that spit doesn't wash away
0.81%:  that spit doesn't wash away the to
0.60%:  that spit doesn't wash the
0.57%:  that spit doesn't wash away that
0.18%:  that spit doesn't wash that
0.13%:  that spit doesn't wash that away
0.06%:  that spit doesn't wash that away!
0.06%:  that's what I was planning to do by
0.06%:  that the way to test
0.06%:  that's with the
0.06%:  other
0.06%:  that it's as potent as the
0.06%:  that I was born that
0.06%:  that it won't destroy
0.06%:  then I stab
0.06%:  that I don't breathe that way
0.06%:  that that's it
0.06%:  that that's what passes
0.06%:  that's why I spent
0.06%:  that there's two ways
0.06%:  that there's a point
0.06%:  that it's worth
0.06%:  that the dentist was a spy who
0.06%:  that that's what it does:
0.06%:  that there's not two
0.06%:  this has
0.06%:  that that's not the weird
0.06%:  that's reason
0.06%:  so that
0.06%:  that I don't breath the
0.06%:  that that way
0.06%:  that it doesn't DE
0.06%:  that's not the best
0.11%:  that's not the best part
0.07%:  that's not the best way
0.06%:  that it's ALREADY spread
0.06%:  what's to
1.55%:  what's to say that
0.49%:  what's to say that this
0.48%:  what's to say that I
0.45%:  what's to say that doesn
0.45%:  what's to say that the
0.29%:  what's to say that I don
0.17%:  what's to say that this doesn

0.06%:  that's why that
0.06%:  that they don't start with
0.06%:  that's better than sp
0.06%:  what's to say that the rest
0.06%:  what's this
0.06%:  that it spreads that way to
0.06%:  to
0.06%:  that's the day that
0.06%:  that's what we do when
0.06%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do a
0.06%:  that that's not way
0.06%:  what's to say I don
0.06%:  that that's the worst
0.06%:  that that's the worst way
0.06%:  what's to stop that
0.06%:  that it's the tooth
0.06%:  that's what a dent
0.06%:  that's not a pretty
0.06%:  that doesn't start to
0.06%:  the best part is I don
0.06%:  that's what poison
0.06%:  that it won't be
0.06%:  despite what I
0.06%:  that the poison se
0.06%:  that there isn't a way that I
0.06%:  that I don't breathe!
0.06%:  it stays that
0.06%:  that poison'
0.06%:  now that I say it that
0.06%:  that was the story
0.06%:  that this doesn't wash
0.06%:  I don't breathe
0.06%:  that's way better than I was planning!
0.06%:  that's what D
0.06%:  that is a
0.19%:  that is a pretty
0.06%:  that's way better than a
0.06%:  that's why I need
0.22%:  that's why I need to start
0.07%:  that's why I need to start planning
0.06%:  that's why I need to stop
0.06%:  that's how this story ends: I
0.06%:  that won't be
0.06%:  that I don't taste what
0.06%:  that the dentist was a spy!
0.06%:  that this tooth
0.06%:  that it doesn't start to wash
0.06%:  don't throw away
0.05%:  that tastes
0.05%:  that the past
0.05%:  that's better than what was
0.05%:  that that's at
0.05%:  that it does not
0.05%:  that it's ALREADY started
0.05%:  that I don't try to eat
0.05%:  that I don't stay
0.05%:  the best part is that I won
0.05%:  that's how I end
0.05%:  that it's the type
0.05%:  that nobody tries
0.05%:  that's why parents
0.05%:  that that doesn't RE
0.05%:  don't stop
0.05%:  that I don't twist
0.05%:  it doesn't start
0.05%:  that's way better than it
0.05%:  that there's po
0.05%:  that the best way to show
0.05%:  that's what that dentist was RE
0.05%:  I'd better wash
0.05%:  that's not to say that the
0.05%:  that there's no body
0.11%:  that there's no body that
0.05%:  that water doesn't stop
0.05%:  that doesn't wash the
0.05%:  that's what they do to
0.05%:  that it's water
0.05%:  that's what that dentist was so
0.05%:  that's what I was planning to do either
0.05%:  they're not
0.05%:  that it's a to
0.05%:  that's at
0.05%:  that's what I was planning to do this past
0.05%:  at that
0.05%:  then pass
0.05%:  that it doesn't wash away to the
0.05%:  that I don't start stab
0.05%:  that's not to say that there
0.05%:  that they don't wear
0.05%:  they don't wash the
0.05%:  that I don't wash that away
0.05%:  that's way better than I had
0.05%:  that's not weird to say
0.05%:  that I was born with a
0.05%:  that this won't start
0.05%:  it stays there and
0.05%:  that we don
0.07%:  that we don't start
0.05%:  that it doesn't er
0.05%:  that it's so
0.05%:  I'd better wash that
0.05%:  that doesn't strip
0.12%:  that doesn't strip away
0.05%:  that I don't try to stab
0.05%:  it doesn't wear
0.05%:  that doesn't start the
0.05%:  that's why I do
0.12%:  that's why I do that
0.05%:  that stops
0.05%:  that when it says
0.05%:  that's what the dentist says too:
0.05%:  that there's no way that a
0.05%:  that is pretty
0.05%:  that I don't swap the
0.05%:  then that's what I
0.05%:  that there's a way to stop that
0.05%:  that I don't wash this
0.05%:  they don't taste
0.05%:  that's not what we do
0.05%:  that bath
0.05%:  that I don't spray the
0.05%:  what's the best way to show
0.05%:  it tastes
0.05%:  don't bother with
0.05%:  that it's hard
0.05%:  that it stays there and that'
0.05%:  that tiny dos
0.05%:  that's two
0.05%:  that it's not water that
0.08%:  that it's not water that was
0.22%:  that it's not water that washes away
0.05%:  that there's a stat
0.05%:  that's better than how
0.05%:  that that's the basis
0.05%:  that was the best day
0.05%:  that teeth don
0.05%:  that's what I spend the
0.05%:  that the poison's bad
0.05%:  the best part is: I don
0.05%:  that I don't E
0.05%:  that there's AL
0.10%:  that there's ALREAD
0.11%:  that there's ALREADY poison
0.05%:  the best part is that no
0.05%:  that's not a phrase
0.05%:  that it doesn't wash past the
0.05%:  that's why I do what
0.05%:  that's what I was planning to do at this party!
0.05%:  that was the worst
0.05%:  that's it! I don
0.05%:  that the poison tastes bad
0.05%:  that what's poison
0.05%:  that the spread
0.05%:  then throw away
0.05%:  that I was poison
0.05%:  that I don't wash with
0.05%:  that I don't wash with soap
0.05%:  they don't wash that part
0.05%:  that's not a bad start
0.05%:  don't try
0.05%:  that's when I start
0.05%:  that I spit the
0.05%:  that there's a way that I
0.05%:  that it stays there and I
0.05%:  that spit doesn't wash away what
0.05%:  that's based on a
0.13%:  that's based on a pretty
0.05%:  that's way better than what I was planning at
0.05%:  that the two are
0.05%:  the best part is that that
0.05%:  that there's a bat
0.05%:  that when I pass
0.05%:  that there isn't so
0.05%:  that I don't wash with water
0.05%:  that it's pot
0.05%:  that it doesn't both
0.05%:  that the D
0.05%:  that it's not spread by the
0.05%:  that's when I started to
0.05%:  that's how I spend this
0.05%:  that that doesn't AL
0.05%:  that's based on a pretty sh
0.05%:  that's the best way to do that
0.05%:  I do
0.40%:  I do that
0.13%:  I do that pretty
0.06%:  I do that at
0.05%:  that's not where this
0.08%:  that's not where this stops
0.05%:  that I don't waste it
0.05%:  then wait
0.05%:  that part'
0.05%:  then I spit the
0.05%:  what's to say that dent
0.05%:  that this won't be a
0.05%:  that there's a bad
0.05%:  that's what these past
0.05%:  that I don't try this at
0.05%:  that's not what we do with
0.05%:  that's where this stops
0.05%:  that that's a way
0.09%:  that that's a way that
0.05%:  that a person
0.05%:  that this doesn't waste
0.05%:  that there's ALREADY a poison
0.05%:  what better
0.05%:  that's way better!
0.05%:  that's what I was planning to do that is
0.05%:  that that's worth
0.05%:  that a poison
0.05%:  that a poison that
0.05%:  that's why we don
0.05%:  that death by poison starts
0.05%:  that '
0.05%:  that's now
0.05%:  that's now what
0.05%:  that I don't start bit
0.05%:  that it doesn't po
0.05%:  that there's not that
0.05%:  that it'd
0.05%:  that's a pretty sh
0.05%:  that's not that weird!
0.05%:  that I don't start so
0.05%:  that's how today went
0.05%:  in
0.08%:  in that
0.05%:  that I don't taste that
0.05%:  that's not the sort
0.05%:  that I'd want
0.05%:  that I'd want to be
0.05%:  that's what that weird taste was!
0.05%:  that's what I was planning to do this year!
0.05%:  that's when I start planning
0.05%:  what's to say that the dentist was
0.05%:  that the dentist that
0.05%:  then it
0.08%:  then it stays
0.05%:  that I don't show
0.05%:  that what the dent
1.07%:  that what the dentist says
0.08%:  that what the dentist was
0.05%:  that doesn't wash away the
0.05%:  that it's not sp
0.05%:  there's that!
0.05%:  it doesn't stay
0.05%:  that I do that with
0.05%:  that's the best way I
0.05%:  that it's stayed
0.05%:  don't wash it away
0.05%:  that doesn't short
0.05%:  that's the best way to do this
0.05%:  that I started at
0.05%:  that when that'
0.05%:  that's how this started
0.05%:  that's not the worst that
0.05%:  that it's not as bad as I
0.05%:  that the dentist who'
0.05%:  that's the way to do
0.05%:  that it RE
0.05%:  that's what they wanted!
0.05%:  then it passes
0.05%:  that doesn't pose its
0.05%:  that's not what I was planning to say at the
0.05%:  the best part is: that
0.09%:  the best part is: that's what
0.05%:  the best part is: that's what I do
0.05%:  the best part is: that's what I was
0.50%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning
0.58%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning to do any
0.40%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning on
0.22%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning to do!
0.07%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning on today
0.05%:  that I don't start pe
0.05%:  that's why the best
0.10%:  that's why the best part
0.05%:  that spit doesn't wash away to
0.05%:  that's what I want to do this
0.05%:  that what we
0.05%:  it's pretty
0.05%:  that it won't wash
0.05%:  that I won't pass this
0.05%:  that what I do
0.05%:  that there's a way to do this
0.05%:  that's not a weird way
0.05%:  that's not so
0.08%:  that's not so bad
0.05%:  that the poison AL
0.05%:  that it doesn't start at
0.05%:  that it's based
0.06%:  that it's based on the
0.05%:  that's it! D
0.05%:  the best part is: now
0.05%:  that I bat
0.05%:  that's not what I was planning this
0.05%:  then spread it to
0.05%:  why
0.05%:  that it's not a wasted
0.04%:  that it won't stop
0.04%:  with that I
0.04%:  that's what I was planning this
0.04%:  that that doesn't waste
0.04%:  that it tastes as
0.04%:  that's REAL
0.04%:  that's what pretty
0.04%:  that poetry doesn
0.04%:  that what the dentist says I
0.04%:  that is the best
0.04%:  that there hasn
0.04%:  it doesn't taste that
0.04%:  that's what it does!
0.04%:  that I don't asp
0.05%:  that I don't aspire to be
0.04%:  that I stop br
0.04%:  that's way better than I was planning to do
0.20%:  that's way better than I was planning to do with
0.08%:  that's way better than I was planning to do this
0.04%:  what's to say that other
0.04%:  that's what the dentist was planning to say!
0.04%:  that the dentist was planning
0.04%:  it doesn't wash away!
0.04%:  that's how this story ends: a
0.04%:  that they don't pass
0.04%:  that's what the dentist was AL
0.04%:  that's not the way
0.04%:  then wash that
0.04%:  what better way to show
0.06%:  what better way to show that
0.04%:  don't wash that
0.04%:  that's a pretty d
0.04%:  that's what I wanted to say!
0.04%:  that it's pretty
0.04%:  that the point
0.04%:  that both these
0.04%:  that what that does
0.04%:  that's how this ends
0.04%:  that I don't waste it by sp
0.04%:  that I don't stare
0.04%:  that it's not a badass
0.04%:  that pretty
0.04%:  that's how this story ends! I
0.04%:  that yes
0.04%:  that the dentist spray
0.04%:  that it's bad
0.04%:  that there's a tooth
0.04%:  that's what that says
0.04%:  don't share
0.06%:  don't share that
0.04%:  that the poison RE
0.04%:  then what
0.04%:  that it doesn't E
0.04%:  that doesn't piss
0.04%:  that it's spread that way too
0.04%:  it's the
0.04%:  that that isn't how
0.04%:  there's this
0.04%:  that I don't taste it!
0.04%:  the best part is: now that
0.04%:  the best part is that I was planning to do
0.04%:  it's not a bad
0.04%:  that the poison D
0.04%:  that the story ends with a

0.04%:  that I don't stop that
0.04%:  what's that they
0.04%:  that rab
0.04%:  that it tastes bad
0.04%:  that the poison has a taste
0.04%:  that's not the worst idea that
0.04%:  that the dentist I was
0.04%:  that this doesn't sp

0.04%:  as

0.03%:  then I throw
0.03%:  that this doesn't start to
0.03%:  then I pass
0.03%:  that's why I stand
0.03%:  that's what the word
0.03%:  that that's how it passes
0.03%:  that the answer is
0.03%:  that that's a bad
0.03%:  that's not wasted
0.03%:  that doesn't strip the
0.03%:  that by poison
0.03%:  that it spreads!
0.03%:  that's what I do at
0.03%:  that I don't spit at
0.03%:  what's the best way to start
0.03%:  I started
0.03%:  that's what I wanted to be
0.03%:  that this has no

0.03%:  don't throw away that
0.03%:  that I don't eat that
0.03%:  that I won't pass it
0.03%:  that's better than what I was planning at

0.03%:  I don't wash
0.03%:  that's not what I said at
0.03%:  what's to say that isn

0.03%:  that it's a pretty
0.03%:  that's the worst I
0.03%:  that this was not
0.03%:  that it stays there and stops
0.03%:  that it's not a death
0.03%:  then I spray
0.03%:  that that's what stops
0.03%:  YEA
0.03%:  that's what the dentist was prob

0.03%:  that we don't share
0.03%:  that that's what po
0.03%:  that's not a story
0.03%:  don't bother with that

0.03%:  that that's a way that poison
0.03%:  I do that with
0.03%:  that there's a way to wash
0.03%:  that the answer to both
0.03%:  that's the best part: this
0.03%:  that's what the dentist says at
0.03%:  that's how this went
0.03%:  that's a theory
0.04%:  that's a theory that
0.03%:  that's what I need

0.03%:  that's not the part
0.03%:  that the past is

0.03%:  that's not so hard
0.03%:  the worst
0.17%:  the worst that
0.04%:  the worst that'
0.03%:  that's how I started planning this
0.03%:  that it's not water based!
0.03%:  that that's better than sp
0.03%:  that I was born with that
0.03%:  that I don't spr
0.03%:  that's why I need to start a
0.03%:  that ass
0.03%:  I started this
0.03%:  that I say that
0.03%:  then I wash that
0.03%:  that it doesn't sat
0.03%:  by this
0.03%:  that what I said
0.03%:  that's better than I was planning!

0.03%:  that I don't waste this by
0.03%:  I start
0.03%:  there's AL
0.03%:  what's to say there isn

0.10%:  so that's what
0.05%:  so that's that
0.05%:  so that's why
0.03%:  that by this I
0.03%:  that's three
0.03%:  that was the best way
0.03%:  that the body treats that as a
0.03%:  that poison has that
0.03%:  that they don't swap
0.03%:  that they wash
0.03%:  that's better than I was planning today
0.03%:  that's what this story ends
0.03%:  that's what I was planning to do there
0.03%:  that's the part that nobody
0.03%:  that I respond
0.03%:  that the worst side
0.03%:  that's way better than what I do
0.03%:  that it doesn't pass by
0.03%:  then spray
0.03%:  then store
0.03%:  that it won't wear

0.03%:  body parts
0.03%:  to be
0.03%:  start
0.03%:  that this story hasn

0.03%:  that's not as bad
0.03%:  that I don't stop with

0.03%:  that's what I wanted to say to
0.03%:  that that's how it spread
0.03%:  that both those
0.03%:  that I don't toast
0.03%:  that was the best I
0.03%:  that won't destroy
0.03%:  what's the best way to do this
0.03%:  that I don't taste a
0.03%:  that a dentist'
0.03%:  that's why I went
0.03%:  that I pass the test
0.03%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: D
0.03%:  that I don't waste this power
0.03%:  that when I started

0.03%:  I'd better wash that tooth
0.03%:  that's yet to
0.03%:  that I don't spit the rest
0.03%:  that's not what they said at
0.03%:  that it's as potent as what they

0.03%:  the best part is that today
0.03%:  that it's not as bad as they
0.03%:  that's what I want to hear today
0.03%:  that the poison starts as
0.03%:  that I don't RE

0.02%:  that's why these
0.02%:  that waste
0.02%:  that's the best part! I don
0.02%:  that's what d
0.02%:  that when I start to
0.02%:  that I don't try that
0.04%:  that I don't try that with
0.02%:  that's the answer to today
0.02%:  that the body treats a
0.02%:  that isn't the worst way that
0.02%:  that's how we start the
0.02%:  that there's no REAL way
0.02%:  that it doesn't bother that
0.02%:  that I hadn
0.02%:  that's what we say when
0.02%:  that it's so pot
0.02%:  that I don't start beh
0.02%:  that there's two ways that
0.02%:  that's what the dentist saw:
0.02%:  I want
0.10%:  I want to stress
0.36%:  I want to stress that this
0.06%:  I want to stress that that
0.06%:  I want to stress that that's a
0.04%:  I want to stress:
0.04%:  I want to stress that the
0.03%:  I want to stress that'
0.05%:  I want to stress that's what
0.03%:  I want to say
0.13%:  I want to say that
0.14%:  I want to say that this
0.04%:  I want to say that that
0.05%:  I want to say that that's the
0.05%:  I want to say that that's a
0.04%:  I want to say that this has
0.03%:  I want to stress: that
0.05%:  I want to stress: that's what
0.03%:  I want to say that'
0.05%:  I want to say that's the
0.03%:  I want to stress: this
0.03%:  I want to stress: that's a
0.03%:  I want to say this
0.03%:  I want to stress that both
0.02%:  I want to stress that that's how
0.02%:  I want to say that this was
0.02%:  I want to stress that that is
0.02%:  I want to say that's the worst
0.02%:  I want to stress that that was
0.02%:  I want to say that's what
0.02%:  I bet
0.03%:  I bet that
0.16%:  I bet that's what
0.08%:  I bet that's what they
0.05%:  I bet that's what the
0.03%:  I bet that's how
0.03%:  I bet that's what dent
0.03%:  I bet that's what they do at
0.02%:  that that's what started
0.02%:  that's what that was!
0.02%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: L
0.02%:  that's better than sw
0.02%:  that's what I spent years
0.02%:  that I don't spit the water
0.02%:  that was what I was planning to spend
0.02%:  I want to stress this
0.02%:  that's better than it
0.03%:  that's better than it was
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do as
0.02%:  that it's not that hard to pass
0.02%:  that this doesn't w
0.02%:  that it then spread
0.02%:  what's the stat
0.02%:  what better way to pass
0.02%:  that when the bad
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do with a
0.02%:  what I
0.02%:  that this doesn't DE
0.02%:  that has been today
0.02%:  that that's not way worse
0.02%:  that's way better than was
0.02%:  what's the story
0.02%:  that's what they tried
0.02%:  then eat it
0.02%:  that the poison's what
0.02%:  that's the point at
0.02%:  that's what was bother
0.02%:  that I don't resist
0.02%:  that it does what I
0.02%:  then stop br
0.02%:  that's not what I was planning to say this
0.02%:  that's why I eat so
0.02%:  that's a story
0.03%:  that's a story that
0.02%:  I do that!
0.02%:  that it stays there! I don
0.03%:  that it stays there! I don't wash
0.02%:  that when it's spread
0.02%:  that it's not as easy
0.02%:  that when I do this
0.02%:  that it's not the other
0.02%:  that's the theory!
0.02%:  that I don't swap that
0.02%:  that I store
0.02%:  that it's a bad
0.02%:  I want to say that's the best
0.02%:  that the poison I was
0.02%:  that it stays down
0.02%:  that when I stop
0.02%:  that's better than what I do
0.02%:  that that is what'
0.02%:  there's an
0.02%:  I do that part
0.02%:  that they'd
0.02%:  that's on
0.02%:  that that doesn't piss
0.02%:  that's another way the
0.02%:  that I don't eat it
0.02%:  there's not that
0.02%:  that was worth
0.02%:  that's the worst news
0.02%:  stop
0.02%:  they don't show
0.05%:  they don't show that
0.29%:  they don't show that part
0.02%:  that's what an
0.02%:  that it doesn't pass that
0.02%:  that it doesn't pass that way
0.02%:  that that's what is
0.02%:  I was
0.04%:  I was planning
0.04%:  I was planning to
0.08%:  I was planning to do that this
0.05%:  I was planning to do that any
0.03%:  I was planning to do that pretty
0.03%:  I was planning to do that with
0.02%:  that's a story that ends
0.03%:  that's a story that ends with a
0.02%:  that a person'
0.03%:  that a person's body
0.02%:  at this rate
0.02%:  that's another day with
0.02%:  better
0.02%:  that the part that
0.02%:  that's how this day
0.04%:  that's how this day went
0.02%:  that's not part
0.02%:  that's how I won
0.04%:  that's how I won this
0.02%:  that that's where it stays! I
0.02%:  that the dentist was a spy who was
0.02%:  that it's based on a
0.02%:  that's why I was born to eat
0.02%:  that I spend the
0.02%:  that's the best worst
0.02%:  that that tiny
0.02%:  that's how I started a
0.02%:  that it sett
0.02%:  that's not AL
0.02%:  that the poison tastes as
0.02%:  that doesn't R
0.02%:  that doesn't stress
0.02%:  that's not the hard
0.02%:  that that doesn't throw
0.02%:  that's what that weird taste was on
0.02%:  that's what death
0.02%:  that's not badass
0.02%:  that they don't test
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do that!
0.02%:  that it's the best
0.02%:  that the dentist who's planning
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do when it
0.02%:  that that's what was
0.02%:  that is the best part
0.02%:  that's how today I
0.02%:  that's despite
0.02%:  that by now
0.02%:  that it's not a tast
0.02%:  that that's another
0.05%:  that that's another way
0.02%:  that it's the parts
0.02%:  that it's the parts that
0.02%:  that's way better than planning
0.02%:  that's not a bad way to phrase
0.08%:  that's not a bad way to phrase that
0.02%:  that I don't taste this
0.02%:  that's the news at
0.02%:  that we don't start with
0.02%:  that's when the
0.02%:  that stab
0.02%:  that that's its
0.02%:  that there's no dis
0.02%:  that it's easy
0.02%:  that this has been a
0.02%:  that the dentist says that's a
0.02%:  that what's shown
0.02%:  that's why I win
0.02%:  that I don't sit
0.02%:  that's what I say when
0.02%:  that that's the best way to pass
0.02%:  that's what bit
0.02%:  that I spit the rest
0.02%:  that it doesn't taste hor
0.02%:  that it passes the
0.02%:  that any other
0.02%:  it doesn't taste as
0.02%:  that that is an
0.02%:  that's not the way that
0.02%:  that isn't what the word
0.02%:  I AL
0.05%:  I ALREAD
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do with any spare
0.02%:  what's to say that when I start
0.02%:  that's what the best
0.02%:  that's what the best parts
0.02%:  that's how this ends!
0.02%:  that's it! I want
0.02%:  that that's not as weird
0.02%:  that's not why I was
0.02%:  that the show
0.02%:  that it po
0.02%:  that the dentist was R
0.02%:  that's not waste
0.02%:  that's way better than sw
0.02%:  hope that's the
0.02%:  that's what I do now
0.02%:  that it's not ALREADY spread
0.02%:  that that doesn't pass
0.02%:  that doesn't stay
0.02%:  the best part is that I do that
0.02%:  that the other ways
0.02%:  then I started
0.02%:  the best part is that as
0.02%:  that that's how it spreads!
0.02%:  that it's not a death ray
0.05%:  that it's not a death ray that
0.02%:  that it's not a path
0.02%:  that I don't wear shoes
0.05%:  that I don't wear shoes that
0.02%:  that it doesn't wear away at
0.02%:  that it spreads that way! I
0.02%:  what's not to say that that
0.02%:  that isn't too
0.02%:  I want to stress: that's the
0.02%:  that the person with
0.02%:  that's the worst way this
0.02%:  that it's started
0.02%:  what's with those
0.02%:  the answer to this
0.02%:  I want to say that that's what
0.02%:  that this won't wear
0.02%:  that I wanted
0.02%:  that death isn't as
0.02%:  that those two parts
0.02%:  that this was what
0.02%:  that it won't be passed
0.02%:  now that I say that it
0.02%:  that these ARE
0.02%:  that's what started the
0.02%:  that there's REAL
0.02%:  that's a pretty thin
0.02%:  that I respond to that
0.02%:  that I respond to that by
0.02%:  that p
0.02%:  that's the part they
0.02%:  that I don't try to wash this
0.02%:  that this doesn't hast
0.02%:  that stress
0.02%:  then spit the tooth
0.02%:  that's what I hope
0.02%:  that the way I
0.02%:  that I don't wash with tap
0.04%:  that I don't wash with tap water!
0.02%:  I start with
0.02%:  that what it
0.02%:  that what it says
0.02%:  that the poison ALREADY has
0.02%:  that's what I do best
0.02%:  that the body has an
0.02%:  that it's done
0.02%:  that's why it was
0.02%:  that it doesn't taste RE
0.02%:  that that's what starts
0.02%:  that I don't throw that
0.02%:  that it's the dent
0.02%:  that it's not bad that
0.02%:  that's where I stop with
0.02%:  why the
0.02%:  that's how I start planning
0.02%:  that there's ALREADY an
0.02%:  that's what I do in
0.02%:  that I don't breathe that way!
0.02%:  that's what the dentist was to
0.02%:  that's not the best part! I
0.02%:  that's what both
0.02%:  that's the best way this
0.02%:  that the third
0.02%:  that it doesn't re
0.02%:  that's how I spent today: planning
0.02%:  that it doesn't sw
0.02%:  that I don't wash those
0.02%:  that's way better than I was planning this
0.02%:  that's the shot
0.02%:  that the spit doesn't wash away!
0.02%:  that there's a distant
0.02%:  that that's not a weird way that
0.02%:  that's what they stand
0.02%:  that won't start
0.02%:  that's one way to start
0.02%:  that's the way I want it!
0.02%:  that was a pretty badass
0.02%:  that was today's news
0.02%:  that I don't see
0.02%:  that's what they base
0.02%:  that bat
0.02%:  that I won't die by
0.02%:  that's despite what
0.02%:  then spit a
0.02%:  that's not a bad start to the
0.02%:  that it's better
0.03%:  that it's better than
0.02%:  that was what I was planning on
0.02%:  that I don't try to eat the
0.02%:  that's not what these
0.02%:  that this doesn't LE
0.02%:  that's what pass
0.02%:  that I don't wash away this
0.02%:  that it's a pot
0.02%:  that the bit
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to be
0.02%:  that's what they spent
0.02%:  that it both
0.02%:  then I start stab
0.02%:  that the dentist's prob
0.02%:  that doesn't that
0.02%:  that part's not that
0.02%:  yeah that's what I was
0.10%:  yeah that's what I was planning
0.05%:  yeah that's what I was planning on
0.03%:  yeah that's what I was planning to do!
0.02%:  that this doesn't start the
0.02%:  that this dose
0.02%:  that there's nobody that
0.02%:  that what the dentist'
0.02%:  that there's no po
0.02%:  that's another day I
0.02%:  that that's not bad either
0.02%:  that's way better than I had it
0.02%:  that's a REAL
0.02%:  that's how it went
0.02%:  that's what bat
0.02%:  that there's bad
0.02%:  that's in the
0.02%:  that's an ass
0.02%:  that that doesn't waste away
0.02%:  then AL
0.02%:  that I won't pass that
0.02%:  that that doesn't taste
0.02%:  that deaths
0.02%:  that they don't show
0.02%:  that there's no by
0.02%:  that's not the worst I
0.02%:  that the poison's the bad
0.02%:  that trains
0.02%:  that there is no way
0.03%:  that there is no way that
0.02%:  that that was a
0.02%:  that is how I spent
0.02%:  that it doesn't sweat
0.02%:  that a body
0.03%:  that a body part
0.02%:  that I do this twenty
0.02%:  that's what I was planning when
0.02%:  that I won't stop
0.02%:  that that's the best way it
0.02%:  that's not what I was planning to say either
0.02%:  what's to say that those
0.02%:  that it's that easy and
0.05%:  that it's that easy and that
0.02%:  that that's not the basis
0.02%:  that's why I started that
0.02%:  then that's spread
0.02%:  that's what I said to
0.02%:  what's the best part is
0.03%:  what's the best part is that I don
0.03%:  what's the best part is that now
0.02%:  that tooth br
0.02%:  that'd be a
0.10%:  that'd be a pretty
0.02%:  I bet that's the
0.02%:  that's not that bad a
0.02%:  that the dentist's ass
0.02%:  that it's 
0.02%:  that when I stop br
0.02%:  that's the part that I don
0.02%:  that the poison had
0.02%:  yeah that's what dent
0.02%:  that I was born with these
0.02%:  why stop with
0.04%:  why stop with teeth
0.02%:  what's to say that it won
0.02%:  that it's not pass
0.02%:  that it doesn't rep
0.02%:  that when I say this
0.02%:  that's what that noise
0.02%:  that's what that noise was!
0.02%:  that was the best way I
0.02%:  that's the part I was
0.02%:  the answer to that is a
0.02%:  it's worth
0.02%:  that's the other way
0.02%:  that I don't habit
0.02%:  that there's not a L
0.02%:  that's the hard
0.02%:  they don't show that part!
0.02%:  that's when I started planning
0.02%:  that's when I started planning this
0.02%:  that the dose was
0.02%:  I was planning to do that either
0.02%:  the other
0.02%:  then D
0.02%:  that's what it says to do!
0.02%:  that's not why I started this
0.02%:  I'd better wash that poison
0.02%:  that the tiny dos
0.02%:  that water and
0.02%:  that's what it tastes
0.02%:  that's why I start
0.02%:  that's what they don
0.02%:  that's what the dentist was spray
0.02%:  that it's spread the
0.02%:  that that's the best word
0.02%:  that's how I passed
0.02%:  that the poison stays a
0.02%:  that doesn't hit
0.02%:  that I don't start b
0.02%:  that this doesn't stop at
0.02%:  that's where I stand:
0.02%:  that that isn't a bad way
0.02%:  I do that two
0.02%:  that I don't eat or
0.02%:  that's better than what it
0.06%:  that's better than what it was
0.02%:  that there's not a way that I
0.02%:  that there's a path
0.02%:  that I start to
0.02%:  that's why I spent the
0.02%:  that stays there and
0.02%:  that's how I started!
0.02%:  then bite
0.02%:  that as soon
0.02%:  that it has any sort
0.02%:  don't share the
0.02%:  that's not a bad way to phrase that!
0.02%:  that's what today has
0.02%:  that it stays there:
0.02%:  what's to say that I D
0.02%:  that it's so potent that I
0.02%:  that it's a type
0.02%:  that these poison
0.02%:  yes that's what I do
0.02%:  that it stays and
0.02%:  that's a hard
0.02%:  that it won't be wasted
0.02%:  that's what I spent the day planning
0.02%:  that I don't swap it
0.02%:  that the taste is
0.02%:  what's better than that:
0.02%:  that death isn't pretty
0.02%:  that's better than that
0.02%:  that the body re
0.02%:  don't spit at
0.02%:  that water doesn't wash it away to
0.02%:  that I don't piss away that
0.02%:  that that's any
0.03%:  that that's any better
0.02%:  that has to
0.02%:  this doesn't at
0.02%:  that ends
0.04%:  that ends this
0.04%:  that ends that
0.03%:  that ends this story
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do thirty
0.02%:  I do that with pretty
0.02%:  stat
0.02%:  that when this starts
0.02%:  that's how I spent this day:
0.02%:  that that's that
0.02%:  that's how I wasted another
0.02%:  that I had any
0.02%:  that post
0.02%:  it's not that the
0.02%:  that the shape
0.02%:  that doesn't sp
0.02%:  that it's not as bad to
0.02%:  I don't eat
0.02%:  that that was the best
0.02%:  that it's not shaped
0.02%:  that it's not a to
0.02%:  that's the way it went
0.02%:  that's what today is
0.02%:  that when that's said
0.02%:  that that's how I started
0.02%:  that's better than I had
0.02%:  that that's the worst way to die
0.02%:  that I don't strip
0.02%:  with that ass
0.02%:  that that doesn't at
0.02%:  that spreads to
0.02%:  that that's not a weird way to wash
0.02%:  there's that too
0.02%:  that there is an
0.02%:  that it was that
0.02%:  that it was that easy!
0.02%:  that I possess any
0.02%:  that's what the dentist was pray
0.02%:  then that's what I say
0.02%:  that it tastes the
0.02%:  both those
0.02%:  that won't stop
0.02%:  don't say that this
0.02%:  that's where I stand at
0.03%:  that's where I stand at this
0.02%:  the part
0.02%:  hope that I
0.03%:  hope that I don't start
0.02%:  that's what it does when
0.02%:  that I had this
0.02%:  that it doesn't wear away that
0.02%:  that that's not AL
0.02%:  that's what tooth br
0.02%:  yeah that's not
0.02%:  that it's not parad
0.02%:  that there's a way to pass this
0.02%:  head
0.02%:  that I breathe it
0.02%:  that's not hard at
0.02%:  that's why I AL
0.02%:  then they
0.02%:  that it doesn't star
0.02%:  that I don't repeat
0.04%:  that I don't repeat this
0.02%:  the best part: that
0.02%:  the best part: that's what
0.02%:  they said
0.02%:  it's not that bad a
0.02%:  that the dentist that says
0.02%:  that's what these two
0.02%:  that this won't start a
0.02%:  that there's no path
0.02%:  that those po
0.02%:  I hope that's a yes
0.02%:  why stop at the
0.02%:  that's the worst way I
0.02%:  that's the way I spent
0.02%:  that's how I stayed
0.02%:  that it doesn't start a
0.02%:  that it stays there a
0.02%:  that I say this
0.02%:  that that way it
0.02%:  that this doesn't ALREAD
0.02%:  that that's not how disease
0.02%:  that that's what a dentist was
0.02%:  that that's in
0.02%:  what's the story with dent
0.02%:  that's what it does:
0.02%:  that's how I start the day:
0.02%:  that is that
0.02%:  that death is the worst way
0.02%:  that it does not pass
0.02%:  what that
0.02%:  I don't say that with a
0.02%:  that's what I wanted to hear
0.02%:  that the way the
0.02%:  I hope that this
0.02%:  that there's a way to do that at
0.02%:  that's why the dentist AL
0.02%:  that that's not a way that
0.02%:  that poison stays there!
0.02%:  that it treats
0.02%:  that has no side
0.02%:  what's to say that in
0.03%:  what's to say that in the past
0.02%:  that there's ALREADY a poison that
0.02%:  what's that I
0.02%:  then do
0.06%:  then do that
0.02%:  that it's spread that way! I
0.02%:  that's L
0.02%:  that that's the best part!
0.02%:  that's what those ads
0.02%:  that I pay
0.02%:  that was what I was planning to do that
0.02%:  that was what I was planning to do that entire
0.02%:  that's not the worst way it
0.02%:  that it's not as bad as that
0.02%:  that there's LE
0.02%:  that I resist
0.02%:  that side
0.02%:  those ARE
0.06%:  those ARE pretty
0.02%:  what's to say that instead
0.02%:  yeah that's how
0.02%:  that this doesn't er
0.02%:  that I stop at
0.02%:  the answer to that is: why
0.02%:  then shoot
0.02%:  that's not water
0.02%:  hope that's how
0.02%:  that I don't pass that sweet
0.02%:  that it doesn't trap
0.02%:  that's how I started to
0.02%:  that it has a taste
0.02%:  that I don't strip away
0.02%:  that the bath
0.02%:  that I don't tear
0.02%:  that nobody's planning
0.02%:  that's how I started with
0.02%:  that sweet
0.02%:  that I don't start w
0.02%:  taste
0.02%:  that the person who said
0.02%:  that poison tastes bad
0.02%:  that's hard
0.02%:  that's hard to say
0.02%:  it's not that easy
0.02%:  I want to stress that it
0.02%:  that it stays there so
0.02%:  that I don't start y
0.02%:  that I don't start planning ways
0.02%:  that words
0.02%:  what's the best way to stop
0.02%:  that's what I want to say to the
0.02%:  that there's not way that
0.02%:  that I don't taste with
0.02%:  that I don't treat
0.02%:  that I don't treat this
0.02%:  that they don't start was
0.02%:  that the d
0.02%:  that's what that sweet
0.02%:  that's the short
0.02%:  this doesn't stop
0.02%:  that I end
0.02%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: DR
0.02%:  that it's not a trap
0.02%:  that when I say 'po
0.02%:  then press it
0.02%:  that's what I want!
0.02%:  that the body treats top
0.02%:  that I don't eat straw
0.02%:  that's why I spent this
0.02%:  at that rate
0.02%:  that it's not REAL
0.02%:  that's why instead
0.02%:  that I RE
0.02%:  that it's both
0.02%:  that it's not a water
0.02%:  that's that then
0.02%:  that 'po
0.02%:  that there isn't a bad
0.02%:  that's what the dentist say
0.02%:  that it stays R
0.02%:  that there's no way that was
0.02%:  that there's a way that poison
0.02%:  that's how I won the war
0.02%:  what do
0.02%:  that poison that'
0.02%:  that there's a shot
0.02%:  that that's how it stays
0.02%:  that's why I need to stop br
0.02%:  that poison AL
0.02%:  that's the answer to what
0.02%:  the best part is that what
0.02%:  that I don't stop with the
0.02%:  that I don't try that at
0.02%:  that with the
0.02%:  don't wash the
0.02%:  that's the word
0.02%:  that death is pretty
0.02%:  that's the part that we
0.02%:  that's what it does to
0.02%:  besides
0.05%:  besides that
0.02%:  that I had that
0.02%:  that it's not wasted by
0.02%:  that soap doesn't wash away
0.02%:  that the worst way
0.02%:  that's an A
0.02%:  that's what I was planning to do with pretty
0.02%:  that this doesn't by
0.02%:  what's to say that with
0.02%:  tons
0.02%:  that that's not what I
0.02%:  what's that other
0.02%:  I want to stress that's the
0.02%:  there's no way that was
0.02%:  that this doesn't betray a
0.02%:  that's not that weird a
0.02%:  then try
0.02%:  then try to wash
0.02%:  that's what those spots
0.02%:  that it's shown
0.02%:  that it's not that bad a
0.02%:  that was an
0.02%:  that's what they paid
0.02%:  that's better than what I was planning to day
0.02%:  that doesn't w
0.02%:  that the dentist saw that
0.02%:  that dentist hy
0.02%:  that taste
0.02%:  then those
0.02%:  then wash it away!
0.02%:  that it stays there past
0.02%:  that's what stories
0.02%:  that water doesn't wash this away
0.02%:  then that's passed
0.02%:  that in that
0.02%:  that's no way
0.02%:  that this power
0.02%:  that this power doesn
0.02%:  that isn't the worst way I
0.02%:  at that point I
0.02%:  then that's how I started
0.02%:  that's why I need a
0.02%:  I want to stress that those
0.02%:  that that's what poetry
0.02%:  third
0.02%:  what's to say that this new
0.02%:  that I don't start that
0.02%:  that's what parents do!
0.02%:  that I don't R
0.02%:  that the dentist's shop
0.02%:  that passes
0.02%:  that's a pretty wide
0.02%:  that water doesn't wash away both
0.02%:  breasts
0.02%:  that this story wasn
0.02%:  that doesn't st
0.02%:  that doesn't spray
0.02%:  hope that it stays on
0.02%:  that the bat
0.02%:  that there's a hand
0.02%:  that this doesn't LEAD to
0.02%:  that's how the story ends: I
0.02%:  the answer to that is: who
0.02%:  pray that it'
0.03%:  pray that it's not
0.02%:  that it stops when
0.02%:  that I don't breathe so
0.02%:  that I was planning to do
0.06%:  that I was planning to do this
0.05%:  that I was planning to do that in
0.02%:  that I was planning to do that with
0.02%:  that the poison has a taste!
0.02%:  that when it's passed
0.02%:  that it does the
0.02%:  that that isn't bad
0.02%:  that this theory stands
0.02%:  that they are
0.02%:  that I treat
0.02%:  that's not bad!
0.02%:  that they don't resist
0.02%:  that was today's trip
0.02%:  that the dentist pays
0.02%:  that there's a stand
0.02%:  that's how I do
0.02%:  that's not what we do at
0.02%:  that's not bad either
0.02%:  I don't stop
0.02%:  that the dentist was a spy who was planning
0.02%:  hope that it'
0.02%:  that's how the day
0.03%:  that's how the day went
0.02%:  it doesn't stop at
0.02%:  that way I
0.02%:  then I press
0.02%:  that it stops at that
0.02%:  boy
0.02%:  don't spray
0.02%:  don't breathe at
0.02%:  that's how I want to die
0.02%:  that I then wash
0.02%:  that's what poetry
0.02%:  that's how I passed that
0.02%:  that I don't start the habit
0.02%:  that the poison's based
0.02%:  that E
0.02%:  bit
0.02%:  that the body is not
0.02%:  that's not what I was planning with
0.02%:  that's the way that poison
0.02%:  that it stays there on
0.02%:  that this won't destroy the
0.02%:  that I wash this
0.02%:  that that's the way we
0.02%:  that I do that pretty
0.02%:  that the path to
0.02%:  that the water I'
0.02%:  that we both
0.02%:  that's not what I started this
0.02%:  that's how I started that
0.02%:  that's what the dentist was planning to say:
0.02%:  that I wash the poison away
0.02%:  that's why the rest
0.02%:  yeah that's what I do!
0.02%:  that that's not RE
0.02%:  that the dentist has to
0.02%:  that's not a story that
0.02%:  that poison was
0.02%:  that I wash and
0.02%:  that's where I was
0.04%:  that's where I was planning
0.03%:  that's where I was planning on
0.02%:  that's where I was planning to stop
0.02%:  that's where I was planning to stop with
0.02%:  that there won
0.02%:  the dent
0.05%:  the dentist'
0.04%:  the dentist says
0.03%:  the dentist was
0.02%:  the dentist says that
0.12%:  the dentist says that's what
0.04%:  the dentist says that's how
0.02%:  the dentist!
0.02%:  the dentist has
0.02%:  that there's a way this
0.02%:  that doesn't er
0.02%:  that bod
0.02%:  that isn't the sort
0.02%:  that it doesn't bat
0.02%:  I want to say that that's how
0.02%:  that I want to stay this
0.02%:  that it doesn't h
0.02%:  then I pass it
0.02%:  what's to say that other dent
0.03%:  what's to say that other dentist
0.02%:  that is what we
0.02%:  that the dentist says what
0.02%:  this was
0.02%:  that's not what I was planning to be
0.02%:  that it's not a death by
0.02%:  that's the phrase
0.02%:  that as the
0.02%:  that's what I want to start
0.02%:  that's how I want it
0.02%:  that there's a DI
0.02%:  that it spreads when
0.02%:  that that doesn't pose its
0.02%:  that's what they want to
0.02%:  that it doesn't spr
0.02%:  that doesn't po
0.02%:  that's what I want this
0.02%:  that's yet another ass
0.02%:  that's why I wear pants
0.02%:  that that's not a weird way to pass
0.02%:  I'd better stop with that
0.02%:  that I don't waste what
0.02%:  that that's the best way to dis
0.02%:  hope that it's not
0.02%:  I don't stop there
0.02%:  that there's no way that stops
0.02%:  that's not why this
0.02%:  that I was planning to spend this
0.02%:  it's not that hard to wash
0.02%:  that I don't short
0.02%:  that's what I started to
0.02%:  with the
0.02%:  that that doesn't stop with
0.02%:  that isn't as
0.02%:  the answer is
0.02%:  that I don't waste away to
0.02%:  don't that
0.02%:  that the '
0.02%:  that it both stays
0.02%:  what's to say that what I
0.02%:  that the poison was the
0.02%:  that the best way to pass
0.02%:  that's not what they said!
0.02%:  that it doesn't wash away the top
0.02%:  that that's a better way than
0.02%:  that ends this story!
0.02%:  that I don't swap this
0.02%:  that their
0.02%:  the answer to that is: I'
0.02%:  that the poison that I
0.02%:  that I won't D
0.02%:  that a body part that
0.02%:  that's what toast
0.02%:  that death isn't that
0.02%:  that's how I start a new
0.02%:  that the dose isn
0.03%:  that the dose isn't so
0.02%:  that they do
0.02%:  that I was not
0.02%:  that dentist who
0.02%:  that I pass on
0.04%:  that I pass on this
0.02%:  that's not what was
0.02%:  that I don't share with
0.02%:  then po
0.02%:  that's what we say to
0.02%:  by teeth
0.02%:  that I'd be poison
0.02%:  to the
0.03%:  to the rest
0.02%:  that I was planning this
0.02%:  that I don't hear
0.02%:  that the way poison
0.02%:  that I don't spit!
0.02%:  that I don't stop the
0.02%:  that's another step
0.02%:  that I don't stop at this
0.02%:  that soap doesn't wash that
0.02%:  that started
0.02%:  it starts
0.02%:  that what this says
0.02%:  that's what those two
0.02%:  that is what'
0.02%:  that I don't eat this
0.02%:  that's the way I spend
0.02%:  that I ALREADY started this
0.02%:  that this doesn't E
0.02%:  that doesn't threat
0.02%:  that's not what I was planning to try
0.02%:  that's it: the
0.02%:  that I don't try to pass
0.02%:  that the two ways
0.02%:  then throw that
0.02%:  that that poison was
0.02%:  the best part is: now I'
0.02%:  that the poison tastes bad!
0.02%:  I hope this
0.02%:  that I don't eat paste
0.02%:  that I pass on the
0.02%:  that I don't start piss
0.02%:  that isn't a bad way
0.02%:  I don't say that to br
0.02%:  that the type
0.02%:  that the body treats that as an
0.02%:  they don't test
0.02%:  the answer to that is that I'
0.02%:  that's another two
0.02%:  say
0.02%:  that I spit that
0.02%:  that's why I started this post
0.02%:  that it doesn't A
0.02%:  I want to stress that what
0.02%:  that's what that says on
0.02%:  that we're both not
0.02%:  that's worth it
0.02%:  then it'
0.02%:  that's what I started to say
0.02%:  that it's not days
0.02%:  that there's at LE
0.02%:  don't bite
0.02%:  at that point why
0.02%:  that I don't repeat that
0.02%:  that there's nobody planning
0.02%:  that's the day I stop
0.02%:  that that's the story
0.02%:  that's it: that
0.02%:  that they don't strip
0.02%:  that that's not a bad way to phrase it:
0.02%:  that the dentist stays
0.02%:  that I then sp
0.02%:  that the person who stab
0.02%:  that's not a badass
0.02%:  that's what to
0.02%:  then spit what
0.02%:  it's not the sort
0.02%:  then I spit!
0.02%:  don't say that I
0.02%:  that water isn't the
0.02%:  tooth
0.02%:  that it does what the
0.02%:  that it doesn't bo
0.02%:  that that isn't way
0.02%:  that there's no body swap
0.02%:  not the
0.02%:  that's better than how I
0.04%:  that's better than how I was
0.14%:  that's better than how I was planning
0.02%:  that it's to
0.02%:  that those tiny dos
0.02%:  that's how I end this
0.02%:  that's how I end this story
0.02%:  that's what they want!
0.02%:  that that's what I started
0.02%:  that it's not worse
0.02%:  that that's what an
0.02%:  that that doesn't set
0.02%:  that isn't so
0.01%:  that I don't stay this
0.01%:  what better way to pass that
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to do in the bat
0.01%:  that it's ALREADY had
0.01%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: LE
0.01%:  that's not what a
0.01%:  that this doesn't start a path
0.01%:  that's not that bad a way
0.01%:  that poison's teeth
0.01%:  the best part is that any
0.01%:  that she'
0.02%:  that she's not
0.01%:  that on
0.01%:  the best part: it
0.01%:  that the poison was what
0.01%:  I hope that's not the
0.01%:  that this doesn't stop the
0.01%:  that doesn't waste a
0.01%:  that's what the dentist AL
0.01%:  that I don't say what
0.01%:  that's it and
0.01%:  I hope that's an
0.01%:  that's the one
0.01%:  that's how I spent a third
0.01%:  that's what these past two
0.02%:  that's what these past two days
0.01%:  that the rest is
0.01%:  then I stop br
0.01%:  that I don't test
0.03%:  that I don't test this by
0.02%:  that I don't test this theory
0.01%:  that's what I do at the
0.01%:  that I was born a
0.01%:  that it's been two
0.04%:  that it's been two days
0.01%:  that!
0.01%:  that it's the worst
0.01%:  that that's not so
0.02%:  that that's not so bad
0.01%:  then that's that
0.01%:  that the worst that's
0.01%:  that bothers
0.01%:  that's what the past twenty
0.01%:  today
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to write
0.01%:  that's what I do:
0.01%:  that's what that taste is:
0.01%:  that's what I tried
0.02%:  that's what I tried to say
0.01%:  that there's that!
0.01%:  the best part is that I AL
0.03%:  the best part is that I ALREADY had
0.01%:  that the spit doesn't wash away at
0.01%:  that's why I started a
0.01%:  that's not the worst bit
0.01%:  that they aren
0.01%:  that's not weird that I say
0.01%:  that don
0.01%:  that it's wasted
0.01%:  that's bad
0.02%:  that's bad news
0.01%:  that I said
0.02%:  that I said that
0.01%:  that it doesn't say that
0.01%:  that the state
0.01%:  then I do
0.07%:  then I do that
0.02%:  then I do this
0.01%:  that I don't spray it at
0.01%:  don't wash the rest
0.01%:  that it does not wash
0.01%:  that's what I was trained
0.01%:  that what they'
0.01%:  what's to say that one
0.01%:  that's not a parad
0.01%:  that water isn't a
0.01%:  that it starts at
0.01%:  that I was b
0.01%:  that the dose that
0.01%:  that's the best way that
0.01%:  that that's the worst way to be
0.01%:  that that's the RE
0.04%:  that that's the REAL reason I
0.03%:  that that's the REAL way
0.01%:  that's not weird that I say that!
0.01%:  that the dentist saw what
0.01%:  that the dentist saw what was
0.01%:  that's how these
0.01%:  that's how the story ends! I
0.01%:  that there's a DE
0.01%:  that a dose
0.01%:  that the two aren
0.01%:  that others
0.01%:  that it doesn't sap the
0.01%:  that's the state
0.01%:  that doesn't eat
0.01%:  that was the best way to start
0.01%:  that I don't start by
0.01%:  that it's had
0.01%:  that's the way it starts
0.01%:  that's what these tiny
0.01%:  that there'd
0.01%:  with those
0.01%:  that there's L
0.01%:  pray that it doesn't taste
0.01%:  don't bat

0.01%:  the best part is that today I
0.01%:  that's how I spent the start
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash past
0.01%:  that's what that taste was:
0.02%:  that's what that taste was: poison
0.01%:  that's not hard!
0.01%:  that's what today has been
0.01%:  that I don't spray this

0.01%:  that I don't hate this
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash away bits that I
0.01%:  that there's no DE
0.01%:  don't waste it by

0.01%:  that's what has to
0.01%:  what better way to show this
0.01%:  it stays on the

0.01%:  then that's what spreads to
0.01%:  that the poison shares
0.01%:  that's the answer!
0.01%:  then I spread
0.01%:  that's better than what I said
0.01%:  that I paid
0.01%:  that's what that taste was! I
0.01%:  the answer to that is: that
0.01%:  that I don't spray that
0.01%:  that not br
0.01%:  that that doesn't R
0.01%:  I don't say that this

0.01%:  that doesn't par

0.01%:  that parad
0.01%:  that and that'
0.02%:  that and that's what
0.02%:  that and that's pretty
0.01%:  that and that's how
0.01%:  that's where today
0.01%:  that was what they
0.01%:  the dentist says that's how I
0.01%:  I was planning to start
0.01%:  that it's not the body parts
0.01%:  that that is what we
0.01%:  that's what the words
0.01%:  that is what they
0.01%:  that's a better way
0.01%:  that's a better way to do
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to end
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to end the
0.01%:  that there's not a sp
0.01%:  it's not that hard to stay
0.01%:  then that's why I started
0.01%:  that teeth don't stop
0.01%:  that doesn't betray
0.01%:  that the dentist who was planning
0.01%:  what's the worst than
0.01%:  that I don't taste it or
0.01%:  that the dentist I saw
0.01%:  that the dentist I saw was
0.01%:  that that's now
0.01%:  that that's passed into
0.01%:  that the poison st
0.01%:  that's what those weird
0.01%:  that's what I started with
0.01%:  what's to say that when it
0.01%:  that's not a bad way to start planning
0.01%:  that's with a
0.01%:  that hands
0.01%:  that that's what D
0.01%:  that's how I passed the
0.01%:  the best part is: that's what I was planning to do A
0.01%:  that I won't start spe
0.01%:  that I don't pass by
0.01%:  that's what that was:
0.01%:  that's the way to spend
0.01%:  that I don't yet
0.01%:  that that's how poetry
0.01%:  that the dentist's sy
0.01%:  that's what they are
0.01%:  it doesn't show
0.01%:  that's the way it has
0.01%:  that's the way it has to be!
0.01%:  that that's not a bad way to write
0.01%:  that it tastes the way
0.01%:  that's I
0.01%:  the best part is that'
0.02%:  the best part is that's what
0.01%:  the best part is that's what I was
0.10%:  the best part is that's what I was planning
0.09%:  the best part is that's what I was planning to do any
0.09%:  the best part is that's what I was planning on
0.03%:  the best part is that's what I was planning to do!
0.01%:  the best part is that's what I was planning on today
0.01%:  that I won't drop
0.01%:  that that's what any
0.01%:  that it's based on what
0.01%:  that there's no spots
0.01%:  that I wear
0.01%:  then start a
0.01%:  that it doesn't pat
0.01%:  that's how I spent today with
0.01%:  that's what I say to dent
0.01%:  that that's where it stays! I don
0.01%:  that is how I'
0.01%:  that's how I see
0.01%:  that's how I see this
0.01%:  spit that
0.01%:  that this doesn't st
0.01%:  that I don't start to sp
0.01%:  that this doesn't rob
0.01%:  that this won't short
0.01%:  that the body passes
0.01%:  that's what I D
0.01%:  that's what birds
0.01%:  the dentist says that's a
0.01%:  that what I say doesn
0.01%:  that I do that at LE
0.01%:  that it doesn't ERA
0.01%:  that I started the
0.01%:  that's the best this
0.01%:  don't I
0.01%:  that's when I started this
0.01%:  that it's not spread by sweat
0.01%:  pray that it does what
0.01%:  I do that at LE
0.01%:  that's what the bad
0.01%:  that I stand with
0.01%:  that what I want to be
0.01%:  that's why I went with
0.01%:  that was what the
0.01%:  that was what the dent
0.03%:  that was what the dentist was planning
0.02%:  that was what the dentist was planning to
0.01%:  that's why a
0.01%:  then I was
0.01%:  best
0.01%:  that there's a two
0.01%:  that's not where I stop
0.01%:  that's not a yes
0.01%:  that I won't spread
0.02%:  that I won't spread this
0.01%:  that I ALREADY possess
0.01%:  that I pass it
0.01%:  what are
0.01%:  then I wash the
0.01%:  that I started at the
0.01%:  that it stays there so that
0.01%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do 
0.01%:  that's not what disease
0.01%:  that another
0.01%:  that this doesn't stay
0.01%:  that it stays a
0.01%:  that that's not weird to
0.01%:  that that's not weird to say
0.01%:  that spit doesn't wash away at
0.01%:  that doesn't sap
0.01%:  that's what the dentist sw
0.01%:  that they don't eat
0.01%:  that's it! I stand
0.01%:  teeth ARE poison
0.01%:  that dentist who says
0.01%:  that there's now
0.01%:  that stars
0.01%:  that I don't stay that
0.01%:  that dentist says
0.01%:  that's pretty based
0.07%:  that's pretty based on what
0.01%:  that it's not tast
0.01%:  that it's that brand
0.01%:  that's what teeth ARE:
0.02%:  that's what teeth ARE: poison
0.01%:  that the rab
0.01%:  that those two are
0.01%:  that it's as potent as a
0.01%:  that the sw
0.01%:  hope that that's a
0.01%:  that it doesn't stop what
0.01%:  that the body ass
0.01%:  that I don't say phrases
0.01%:  then I start a
0.01%:  what's to say that the person
0.01%:  that it passes that
0.01%:  that's what body
0.01%:  that that's why it doesn
0.01%:  that doesn't waste that
0.01%:  that that's how it started
0.01%:  that is what the
0.01%:  that's how that went today
0.01%:  they don't resist
0.01%:  that's it! I need
0.02%:  that's it! I need to start
0.01%:  that I say that phrase
0.01%:  that's what parents do to
0.01%:  that hand
0.01%:  pray that the dentist'
0.01%:  that that's not where I
0.01%:  that it's as potent as I
0.01%:  that's not the worst side
0.01%:  that when those
0.01%:  that's why there was
0.01%:  that that's not so weird that I
0.01%:  that's its
0.01%:  so that's how I spent
0.01%:  to be honest with
0.01%:  that they're so
0.01%:  it tastes so
0.01%:  that's the worst way to spend
0.01%:  that it has stayed
0.01%:  that it's not pat
0.01%:  they don't throw
0.01%:  that I don't start ha
0.01%:  I don't breathe that
0.01%:  it's not that bad!
0.01%:  that's not a body
0.18%:  that's not a body part that
0.03%:  that's not a body part that I
0.03%:  that's not a body part that has
0.01%:  that's not a body part with
0.01%:  that's not a body part that is
0.01%:  to that I say: what
0.01%:  that there's ALREADY a way
0.01%:  that I do that 
0.01%:  then the worst
0.01%:  then the worst that'
0.01%:  that I try
0.01%:  that I don't stop there
0.01%:  that I do that as
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to do here
0.01%:  that besides
0.01%:  that that doesn't stop the
0.01%:  that it's a short
0.01%:  that they're as
0.01%:  that's why I need to start sp
0.01%:  that I was born to
0.01%:  that it's not a hard
0.01%:  that that's what poetry is!
0.01%:  it hasn
0.01%:  that's how I wasted the
0.01%:  that shit
0.01%:  that the spit I
0.01%:  that that doesn't pose a
0.01%:  that breasts
0.01%:  that's why what
0.01%:  that the way the poison
0.01%:  that's what the news today
0.01%:  that's not what they said to
0.01%:  that I don't eat other
0.01%:  that I don't wash that away!
0.01%:  that's why the D
0.01%:  that I don't trash
0.01%:  it's not that I was
0.05%:  it's not that I was planning
0.01%:  that the poison I'd be
0.01%:  that it spreads the way that
0.01%:  yes that's the
0.01%:  that's how I won the day
0.01%:  that they don't waste
0.01%:  that when I stab
0.01%:  that show
0.23%:  that showers don't wash
0.13%:  that showers don't wash it away
0.10%:  that showers don't wash away
0.09%:  that showers don't wash it away!
0.01%:  that showers and
0.01%:  that showers and bath
0.01%:  that doesn't waste what
0.01%:  that there's what
0.01%:  then at
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to start
0.01%:  that that's how I was
0.02%:  that that's how I was planning
0.10%:  that that's how I was planning to spend
0.01%:  that's what the news says
0.01%:  that's how they do
0.01%:  I'd be
0.02%:  I'd be pretty
0.01%:  it's AL
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to spend the start
0.01%:  that doesn't spare
0.01%:  that there's ALREADY a tiny
0.01%:  that when they start
0.01%:  that isn't how the
0.01%:  that isn't how the body
0.01%:  that sort
0.01%:  that spit doesn't wash those
0.01%:  that it's spread by a
0.01%:  that's another way that D
0.01%:  that's D
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash away to
0.01%:  that's the basis on
0.01%:  that it doesn't taste how
0.01%:  that I don't swear
0.01%:  that's what I say to the dentist:
0.01%:  that doesn't stab
0.01%:  that I was planning on this
0.01%:  don't throw away the sp
0.04%:  don't throw away the spit that
0.01%:  that I don't betray
0.01%:  that doesn't trap
0.01%:  that this doesn't A
0.01%:  that the dentist was a robot
0.01%:  that I won't stab
0.01%:  I want to say that's a bad
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to try
0.01%:  that white
0.01%:  by '
0.01%:  that r
0.01%:  I do that by
0.01%:  that today is the
0.01%:  it doesn't sp
0.01%:  that it stays there! D
0.01%:  there's two
0.01%:  that's now the best part
0.01%:  that I don't pass away with
0.01%:  that the body has no
0.01%:  that's not where that
0.01%:  that's what we want!
0.01%:  that's what I went
0.01%:  that's what I went with
0.02%:  that's what I went with today
0.01%:  that nobody's sp
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to do in a
0.01%:  what's to say the dentist was
0.01%:  that it was worth
0.01%:  that's what the pretty
0.01%:  that it's a top
0.01%:  that is why I don
0.01%:  that I don't strip the
0.01%:  I want to stress that it's the
0.01%:  that's the way to start
0.01%:  that it doesn't shr
0.01%:  that has been today's trip
0.01%:  that that's the basis on
0.01%:  that's the part I was planning to
0.01%:  that it's not the type
0.01%:  that I wash that down
0.01%:  I want to say that that was
0.01%:  that it has no ad
0.01%:  what with the
0.01%:  that is how I spend
0.01%:  what's to say that these two
0.01%:  that's the side
0.01%:  that the dentist shops
0.01%:  that there's no sw
0.01%:  what's that noise
0.01%:  that we don't stop
0.01%:  then do that two
0.01%:  that that has an
0.01%:  don't r
0.01%:  that when this story
0.01%:  that I don't wash away the parts
0.01%:  they don't start with the
0.01%:  that's the worst way to be
0.01%:  that this doesn't war
0.01%:  that's a story that I
0.01%:  then I start sp
0.01%:  that I don't r
0.01%:  it doesn't st
0.01%:  that doesn't stop what
0.01%:  that that's not what we
0.01%:  that teeth don't wash
0.01%:  I RE
0.01%:  that's what tatto
0.01%:  hope it
0.04%:  hope it doesn't wash
0.03%:  hope it stays
0.03%:  hope it stays that
0.02%:  hope it doesn't start
0.01%:  hope it doesn't wash away
0.01%:  the best part is: no
0.01%:  that's the answer to that!
0.01%:  don't eat!
0.01%:  that that's what I was born
0.01%:  hope that's the way
0.01%:  that I was planning to start
0.01%:  that's way better than what I was planning to sp
0.01%:  I'd better wash this
0.01%:  I'd better wash this tooth
0.01%:  that's how I was born
0.01%:  don't say this
0.01%:  that's the body part that I
0.01%:  that that's a better way!
0.01%:  don't wash that shit
0.01%:  that I pass on that
0.01%:  that's not what is
0.01%:  that I don't say this to
0.01%:  then I spread it to
0.01%:  that's the new
0.01%:  that's the new story
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to do R
0.01%:  that's how I beat this
0.01%:  that that's not a way to spread the
0.01%:  that's how I spend a
0.01%:  then I do that with
0.01%:  that I stay a
0.01%:  that I don't wash it away at
0.01%:  the best part is that I had to
0.01%:  that's where it
0.04%:  that's where it stops
0.02%:  that's where it stops!
0.01%:  that's where it stays:
0.01%:  that I don't wear this
0.01%:  then twist
0.01%:  this was the
0.01%:  this was the best
0.01%:  that that was how
0.01%:  then two
0.03%:  then two days
0.01%:  then two days pass
0.01%:  what's that based
0.01%:  that it's not a part
0.01%:  that there's not a 
0.01%:  that doesn't stop that
0.01%:  that it doesn't taste A
0.01%:  that I need to wash
0.01%:  it's not bad
0.01%:  that's what water tastes
0.01%:  that we don't both
0.01%:  that's not how they
0.01%:  that this one
0.01%:  that poison's taste
0.01%:  that it's not a story that
0.01%:  that it's not de
0.01%:  that that is how I
0.01%:  that has not
0.01%:  I say that'
0.01%:  that it doesn't step
0.01%:  that I ALREADY had that
0.01%:  that poison tastes the way
0.01%:  then that's why I was
0.01%:  that's why I do this!
0.01%:  that's the way that dent
0.01%:  I'd better not stop
0.01%:  that the dentist show
0.01%:  that that's not so bad either
0.01%:  that's how I passed this
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to do then
0.01%:  what's to say that teeth
0.01%:  that doesn't LEAD to a
0.01%:  the ins
0.01%:  that doesn't pass it
0.01%:  what's to say that we
0.01%:  that it's the brand
0.01%:  that's how that story
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to start the
0.01%:  what's to stop the
0.01%:  that doesn't taste so
0.01%:  that's what the posters said
0.01%:  that it's not passed to
0.01%:  that's why I need to start bath
0.01%:  that it's REAL
0.01%:  that's what the stories say!
0.01%:  yeah that's a
0.01%:  that it stays there to
0.01%:  yeah that's not what
0.01%:  yeah that's the
0.01%:  that I don't spit or
0.01%:  that I don't spit or wash
0.01%:  that's what teeth do:
0.01%:  that the DE
0.01%:  what's with those dent
0.01%:  star
0.01%:  that I had an
0.01%:  that's what a dentist says!
0.01%:  that that's not a parad
0.01%:  that this was the reason
0.01%:  that I don't wipe the
0.01%:  that's not what these words
0.01%:  that's why we started
0.01%:  that's not what I was planning to start
0.01%:  that's R
0.01%:  that's not weird to say at
0.01%:  that's the way I want to start
0.01%:  what better way to do that than D
0.01%:  we both
0.01%:  that the dentist's par
0.01%:  that it's not that easy to wash
0.01%:  that so
0.01%:  that there's no way that po
0.01%:  that it's as easy to spread
0.01%:  then that's what starts
0.01%:  they don't wear
0.01%:  that's the part we don
0.01%:  that's how today was
0.02%:  that's how today was spent
0.01%:  that's where I stand this
0.01%:  now that I say that:
0.01%:  that this has a
0.01%:  that I won't trip
0.01%:  that I want to test this by
0.01%:  that doesn't hast
0.01%:  that it washes
0.01%:  that's how I want to start this
0.04%:  that's how I want to start this day
0.01%:  that's how I want to start this day:
0.01%:  that bit's not
0.01%:  that this doesn't b
0.01%:  that it's as easy as that to be
0.01%:  don't try that
0.01%:  that they won
0.04%:  that they won't start
0.01%:  that it stays there! I'd
0.01%:  that it stays on those
0.01%:  that it doesn't wash or sweat
0.01%:  that it doesn't store
0.01%:  that I don't repeat what
0.01%:  that stat
0.01%:  that when it was
0.01%:  that's what I was planning today:
0.01%:  that it's not that the
0.01%:  those are both RE
0.01%:  don't share this
0.01%:  that it's not a top
0.01%:  that it doesn't start the
0.01%:  that's why I sp
0.01%:  that's why I spit tooth
0.01%:  that's why I spit the
0.01%:  that there's any basis
0.01%:  that's what parents say
0.01%:  that there's not a bit
0.01%:  two
0.01%:  that it doesn't taste a
0.01%:  it stops
0.01%:  it stops there
0.01%:  then pray
0.04%:  then pray that
0.01%:  then pray that it
0.01%:  then pray that this
0.01%:  then pray that the
0.01%:  that's the body parts
0.01%:  that's the body parts that
0.01%:  that's what the dentist spray
0.01%:  that doesn't show the
0.01%:  that I stop at two
0.01%:  then I stab the
0.01%:  that I say that with
0.01%:  yes!
0.01%:  that I don't try to eat a
0.01%:  that I don't wear the
0.01%:  that's how it ends
0.01%:  that the body parts we
0.01%:  that's the reason to
0.01%:  that that's not a better
0.01%:  that there's poison at
0.01%:  that's what that weird taste was:
0.01%:  what's the down
0.01%:  that it doesn't wrap
0.01%:  that's not the worst way the
0.01%:  the best part is: that's not
0.01%:  the best part is now
0.01%:  the best part is now that
0.01%:  that's what western
0.01%:  don't spit at the
0.01%:  that water is not
0.01%:  that's not two
0.01%:  that's how I started a new
0.01%:  that's the REAL reason why I was
0.01%:  that I don't try to bat
0.01%:  that there's no way to diss
0.01%:  that word
0.01%:  that the bath water
0.01%:  then I die
0.01%:  that's what ends
0.01%:  that the dentist part
0.01%:  that the dentist part was
0.01%:  that's how we start today
0.01%:  that there's no bath
0.01%:  that's not to say that this was
0.01%:  that what I say in
0.01%:  that the poison was that
0.01%:  that when I spit the
0.01%:  that's the thesis

0.01%:  that I don't throw that away
0.01%:  that spit doesn't waste
0.01%:  in the past
0.01%:  that I spit and
0.01%:  that's how I won this day
0.01%:  that there's a way to stand
0.01%:  that it doesn't wash away the po
0.01%:  that water doesn't stop that
0.01%:  that it doesn't ob
0.01%:  that's why these past

0.01%:  that sword
0.01%:  that I stay at
0.02%:  that I stay at this
0.01%:  don't waste the
0.01%:  the answer to that is: that's a
0.01%:  that soap doesn't wash away that
0.01%:  that is the power
0.01%:  that's the way it was done
0.01%:  what's the best way to wash it
0.01%:  that the poison stays as
0.01%:  that it has to pass
0.01%:  that it's not watery
0.01%:  that the st
0.01%:  this has been today
0.01%:  that's a pretty st
0.01%:  that's what the dentist was DR
0.01%:  I want this
0.01%:  that's not what I was planning either
0.01%:  that it's not spray
0.01%:  the past
0.01%:  what started
0.01%:  that it does what they
0.01%:  that it has spread to the
0.01%:  that it's not a taste
0.01%:  I don't say that with sass
0.01%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: DE
0.01%:  that's the path to
0.01%:  that's not a weird way that
0.01%:  that the person who's stab
0.01%:  that's why I was so
0.01%:  stand
0.01%:  that poison was the
0.01%:  that I don't start we
0.01%:  that we don't say
0.01%:  that I don't taste how
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash away that bit
0.01%:  that the poison's at
0.01%:  that I was planning to stab
0.01%:  on the rest
0.01%:  yes I
0.01%:  that that's not as weird as I
0.01%:  that doesn't throw the
0.01%:  that it tastes as bad
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash this away!
0.01%:  that's the REAL reason I was
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash that way
0.01%:  that's what that taste is! I
0.01%:  that's how we start this new
0.01%:  that trees
0.01%:  it's not RE
0.01%:  that it's not top
0.01%:  that's what I was planning on today:
0.01%:  that it's the way
0.01%:  that it's the way that
0.01%:  E
0.01%:  that that is what's been
0.01%:  that the taste and
0.01%:  I don't say that to be a
0.01%:  that that's the way I want
0.01%:  that it's not a death sp
0.01%:  that birds
0.01%:  that that way I
0.01%:  that those are both
0.01%:  that it's not what they
0.01%:  that it doesn't pre
0.01%:  that's what that does
0.01%:  the best part is that a
0.01%:  I bet that's a
0.01%:  I bet that's a pretty
0.01%:  that I wash with
0.01%:  that that's not bat
0.01%:  that it's passed that way to
0.01%:  that the showers and
0.01%:  that I wait
0.01%:  that's ALREADY what I was planning on today
0.01%:  that's not a bad way to waste
0.01%:  that I don't wish to be
0.01%:  that's set
0.01%:  what's to say that we don
0.01%:  that I don't eat soap bars
0.01%:  what's to say that when I die
0.01%:  that that's E
0.01%:  that it's not a spray
0.01%:  that it's not a spray that
0.01%:  that there isn't a DE
0.01%:  that I don't waste years
0.01%:  then I stab it
0.01%:  that's why I stop
0.01%:  what's to say that a dent
0.01%:  so that's what they
0.01%:  it's not that hard to see
0.01%:  that when I say 'ass
0.01%:  that that's what I wanted
0.01%:  that's what the news story
0.02%:  that's what the news story said!
0.01%:  that's what the news story was
0.01%:  that the poison r
0.01%:  that the poison rash
0.01%:  beyond
0.01%:  that's better than say
0.01%:  then dro
0.01%:  that that's not a dirty
0.01%:  that's it! A
0.01%:  what's better than two
0.01%:  that's way better than what I was planning to do: R
0.01%:  that doesn't LEA
0.01%:  I want to say that the
0.01%:  that dentist was a
0.01%:  that this doesn't show I
0.01%:  then eat it!
0.01%:  that at any
0.01%:  that's with a pretty
0.01%:  that that's why we
0.01%:  that it's not that bad a way
0.01%:  that we don't swap
0.01%:  that I don't pass these
0.01%:  that's what these words in

0.01%:  that I stay the
0.01%:  that the dentist saw what I was planning
0.01%:  then I bite
0.01%:  that's how I was planning to spend this year!

0.01%:  that it'd be that
0.01%:  that it'd be that easy!
0.01%:  I'd better stop planning

0.01%:  that's the way it ends
0.01%:  that based
0.01%:  that based on that
0.01%:  that based on this
0.01%:  it ends
0.01%:  that the story has
0.01%:  that I do this on
0.01%:  that there is a way
0.01%:  there's no way that stops with
0.01%:  that's how I started planning to
0.01%:  that that part was
0.01%:  that's what the story was
0.01%:  that the poison sw
0.01%:  that poison's that
0.01%:  that it doesn't wash away what
0.01%:  that I won't start with
0.01%:  pray that the dentist has
0.01%:  that radio
0.01%:  wait!

0.01%:  that's what I was ALREADY planning to do in that
0.01%:  what's the best way to start a
0.01%:  that's what I spend two
0.01%:  that I do this three
0.01%:  that I don't wash that paste
0.01%:  that it's the water
0.02%:  that it's the water that
0.01%:  that it's the D
0.01%:  that I do this at LE
0.01%:  that pray
0.01%:  then spit those
0.01%:  that I pass on this sweet
0.01%:  that it's not L
0.01%:  that's way better than planning to
0.01%:  that's what dentist says
0.01%:  that's what I was planning with
0.01%:  pray that the dentist shows
0.01%:  that the body parts that I'
0.01%:  that what this story
0.01%:  that what this story needs
0.01%:  that's what this entry
0.01%:  there's no way that it
0.01%:  an
0.01%:  that's why the past
0.01%:  I don't stop at that
0.01%:  that was the worst day I
0.01%:  then that's what stays
0.01%:  that I start sp
0.01%:  that's the day I stop br
0.01%:  that it's not AD
0.01%:  that's what the worst
0.01%:  don't breathe that way
0.01%:  that the body stores this
0.01%:  that in that way
0.01%:  I was planning on that
0.01%:  that that's the best way to rid
0.01%:  then it spread
0.01%:  that it's a part
0.01%:  that I store it
0.01%:  that her
0.01%:  that this story was
0.01%:  that that's not a step towards
0.01%:  then do that a
0.01%:  that's not planning
0.01%:  that's the part that I was
0.01%:  that's pretty based on how
0.01%:  that it's not as bad as what
0.01%:  that it's not as bad as what they
0.01%:  I hope that's what it says
0.01%:  that's now a
0.01%:  that doesn't show that I was
0.01%:  that what I say and
0.01%:  that's what I was ALREADY planning to spend this
0.01%:  that I read
0.01%:  then star
0.01%:  that it's been a
0.01%:  that I don't trap
0.01%:  that's what death by poison tastes
0.01%:  that the dentist who saw
0.01%:  that that's how it starts
0.01%:  that the dentist's hy
0.01%:  that's what that dentist says
0.01%:  what's to say that another
0.01%:  that's based on how
0.01%:  that there's no way that D
0.01%:  that it doesn't taste or
0.01%:  that's what that weird taste on
0.01%:  what do they
0.01%:  that the story was
0.01%:  that's not as weird as that
0.01%:  that ant
0.01%:  that I don't say a
0.01%:  that I was planning to do that at
0.01%:  that it's ALREADY done that!
0.01%:  that's not pretty
0.01%:  that they're not planning
0.01%:  that I won't die a
0.01%:  that it's not the bad
0.01%:  that is what dent
0.01%:  at that point why bother
0.01%:  I want to stress: that's the way
0.01%:  that it doesn't s
0.01%:  that part's not a
0.01%:  that I share that
0.01%:  what's to say what
0.01%:  those ARE two
0.01%:  the best part is that as I
0.01%:  that I pass this down
0.01%:  that brands
0.01%:  that to be
0.01%:  that the threat is
0.01%:  that I don't breath with
0.01%:  that's why I taste
0.01%:  that water'
0.01%:  yes that's what I was planning to do!
0.01%:  that the dentist's a
0.01%:  that the reason this
0.01%:  that does the
0.01%:  that it's not bath water
0.01%:  that isn't that a pretty
0.01%:  that it's not po
0.01%:  then I stab that
0.01%:  that that won't stop
0.01%:  that it doesn't trash
0.01%:  then that's how it stays
0.01%:  that I don't write that
0.01%:  the taste!
0.01%:  that it's the best part
0.01%:  that's the down
0.01%:  that I don't breathe it at
0.01%:  that it doesn't DEL
0.01%:  that's a he
0.01%:  that there's no way that bit
0.01%:  that this doesn't betray that
0.01%:  then post
0.01%:  don't say that the
0.01%:  that it doesn't bar
0.01%:  then I throw that
0.01%:  that's not a bet
0.01%:  that has the
0.01%:  that it doesn't shower
0.01%:  that I d
0.01%:  that's what that noise was:
0.01%:  that the body stores that
0.01%:  I bet that's the part
0.01%:  I bet that's the part that
0.01%:  I bet that's the way
0.01%:  that that stops there
0.01%:  that I won't waste that
0.01%:  then that's how I stay
0.01%:  that that was the best part
0.01%:  that this has started
0.01%:  that I'd want to test
0.01%:  that I'd want to test this by
0.01%:  that's the way I want to do
0.01%:  that I spent the
0.01%:  that that's how any
0.01%:  that's it! I spent
0.01%:  that's why I want to be the
0.01%:  that when it tastes
0.04%:  that when it tastes bad
0.01%:  that the past is the
0.01%:  that's not where this stops:
0.01%:  what was
0.04%:  what was that
0.03%:  what was the point
0.01%:  that it won't do
0.01%:  what's not to say that I D
0.01%:  that it's the type that
0.01%:  then store that
0.01%:  that the poison's bad taste
0.01%:  what's a
0.01%:  that I don't stab or
0.01%:  that's the worst it
0.01%:  that's why I need to start planning that
0.01%:  that's why the worst
0.01%:  that spit doesn't AL
0.01%:  I hope that's not a bad way
0.01%:  don't spit that water
0.01%:  that is why the
0.01%:  that that's worth it
0.01%:  that there's A
0.01%:  that the poison's that easy
0.01%:  that speed
0.01%:  that's what I wanted to say to the
0.01%:  I want to say that's the best part
0.01%:  that DR
0.01%:  that it doesn't DIL
0.01%:  breathe in
0.01%:  that I don't pat
0.01%:  that's what spit
0.01%:  that spr
0.01%:  that it doesn't ab
0.01%:  that it bothers the
0.01%:  that poison has teeth
0.01%:  what is
0.02%:  what is that
0.01%:  that when I start sp
0.01%:  yes that is
0.01%:  that that has no
0.01%:  that's not the part that was
0.01%:  that water isn't that
0.02%:  that water isn't that bad
0.01%:  that's when I say
0.01%:  that there's no soap
0.01%:  that that's not weird to say!
0.01%:  that's what they want to do
0.01%:  that I ALREADY had an
0.01%:  that I don't piss away the
0.01%:  this has been a story
0.01%:  that's what I stand
0.01%:  that's that on
0.01%:  the best part is that at
0.01%:  what's to say that dentist
0.01%:  that was the best worst
0.01%:  that there's a way to dis
0.01%:  that's when I start planning to
0.01%:  that that's the worst way I
0.01%:  that I don't both
0.01%:  that it tastes so
0.01%:  that it tastes so bad
0.02%:  that it tastes so bad that I'
0.01%:  that it doesn't wash that away
0.01%:  I want to stress: that is what
0.01%:  that I do this by
0.01%:  that this doesn't betray how
0.01%:  that it doesn't tear
0.01%:  that's how I pass
0.01%:  worst
0.01%:  that isn't a waste
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to spend that
0.01%:  the best part is that I was ALREADY planning to do a
0.01%:  that's why I eat the
0.01%:  that's what I want to do at
0.02%:  that's what I want to do at this
0.01%:  that isn't how that
0.01%:  that's what those weird spots
0.01%:  that I'd want to stay
0.01%:  that's not a bit
0.01%:  that the story hasn
0.01%:  that it's not LI
0.01%:  the best part is that I was ALREADY planning to d
0.01%:  that nearby
0.01%:  that's what I was planning to say the
0.01%:  that it's not death by water
0.01%:  what's to say this won
0.01%:  that's not to say that what I said
0.01%:  that the body treats what I
0.01%:  that's what I was ALREADY planning to do the
0.01%:  that it's hard to say
0.02%:  that it's hard to say what
0.01%:  I ALREADY started with
0.01%:  that's not dirty
0.01%:  that the person I stab with
0.01%:  that's not what we say
0.01%:  that the dentist's planning
0.01%:  that the poison was a
0.01%:  that what's that
0.01%:  then I spread that
0.01%:  that doesn't show that I was planning
0.01%:  that's a bet
0.01%:  that's how instead
0.01%:  that it's not r
0.01%:  both these
0.01%:  that sett
0.01%:  that I had parents that
0.01%:  that that's the word
0.01%:  that I don't hate that
0.01%:  that's a best
0.01%:  that I do that by
0.01%:  there's no bad
0.01%:  that was what this
0.01%:  I don't sp
0.01%:  I don't spit that
0.01%:  that this won't be the worst way
0.01%:  that's way better than spit!
0.01%:  that this doesn't betray what
0.01%:  yes that's a
0.01%:  that it's not years
0.01%:  that they're planning
0.01%:  that's what we say to the
0.01%:  that's what I paid
0.01%:  that's the part that I was planning
0.01%:  nose
0.01%:  that isn't too bad
0.01%:  hope that that's as
0.01%:  that that's a worthy
0.01%:  that the anti
0.01%:  that's how I won at
0.01%:  that's the best this day
0.01%:  that it doesn't stay at
0.01%:  that it's ALREADY done the
0.01%:  that that's not wasted
0.01%:  they don't wash this
0.01%:  that's why I do the
0.01%:  the answer is Y
0.01%:  I was planning on that today
0.01%:  I hope this doesn
0.03%:  I hope this doesn't start
0.01%:  that poison's what
0.01%:  that's that! D
0.01%:  this past
0.01%:  there is
0.01%:  that that's how anti
0.01%:  that's the body part with
0.01%:  that the shape and
0.01%:  that there isn't a two
0.01%:  that it's not tap
0.01%:  it's not that they
0.01%:  that I taste it
0.01%:  that the dentist was a spy who'
0.01%:  that the poison w
0.01%:  I bet that's what they said
0.01%:  that I don't eat the straw
0.01%:  the best part is that I was ALREADY planning on sw
0.01%:  that's what I want this to
0.01%:  that the poison's that bad
0.01%:  that that's what stories
0.01%:  it's not a bad taste
0.01%:  that it doesn't wash away:
0.02%:  that it doesn't wash away: that
0.01%:  that's what the dentist was stab
0.01%:  that death isn't a pretty
0.01%:  that the dentist sw
0.01%:  that spit doesn't re
0.01%:  that water doesn't wash it away E
0.01%:  that it's not bat
0.01%:  that I start with the top
0.01%:  that that doesn't pre
0.01%:  that's what we started
0.01%:  that I breathe in
0.01%:  I'd say that these
0.01%:  that it's not that hard to sp
0.01%:  that's sorta what they
0.01%:  that in the past I was
0.01%:  that I don't re
0.01%:  that part's been
0.01%:  what's with the two
0.01%:  that tap water and
0.01%:  that bones
0.01%:  that this doesn't taste as
0.01%:  it doesn't stab
0.01%:  that it's the brand that
0.02%:  that it's the brand that says
0.01%:  that I went
0.01%:  then that it
0.02%:  then that it stays
0.01%:  that's what they saw on
0.01%:  that I wash that away
0.01%:  that there's any data
0.01%:  that's the story we
0.01%:  pretend
0.04%:  pretend that

0.01%:  that I don't stop by a
0.01%:  that's what bad
0.01%:  that's what bad parents
0.01%:  that doesn't D
0.01%:  that's why I wanted to stop
0.01%:  then I shoot
0.01%:  that I taste the
0.01%:  now that'
0.03%:  now that's what
0.01%:  that sweat
0.01%:  that we don't wash

0.01%:  that there's not a host
0.01%:  that I don't wear those
0.01%:  that I don't breath!

0.01%:  that a person who
0.01%:  the best part is that today'
0.01%:  that doesn't abs
