0.04%:  I bet you were
0.04%:  I have to say no to

0.04%:  that would be a real one!
0.04%:  I find that to be even

0.04%:  if I read only
0.07%:  if I read only one salad
0.04%:  I would have to get
0.04%:  that would beat a good non

0.07%:  I doubt that will ever be as good a
0.04%:  odds
0.15%:  odds are that
0.14%:  odds are you
0.10%:  odds are it

0.13%:  then I too would find it a very
0.04%:  then I would eat it of
0.04%:  if you want to get all hard
0.04%:  if so that would be a deal
0.04%:  I lost

0.04%:  that would be so in
0.04%:  the only one
0.04%:  I have good news for you all
0.04%:  if you are so
0.04%:  I will give you a bad
0.04%:  that would be salad too

0.04%:  I was told that no
0.04%:  that salad would be ever
0.04%:  if not then all
0.10%:  if not then all you did
0.09%:  if not then all you did was go
0.04%:  if you read that I will go
0.04%:  if I only want
0.12%:  if I only want to eat
0.04%:  then it would only be as
0.04%:  if I read a list
0.04%:  if so I will go out and try
0.04%:  I have read a list
0.04%:  then I would do it for
0.04%:  the only salad I do
0.04%:  if is that
0.04%:  if so then I doubt your
0.04%:  I bet it would have
0.04%:  if all you have to read to
0.04%:  I got a new
0.06%:  I got a new salad
0.04%:  if I ever get that
0.04%:  I read how to fo
0.04%:  that salad would not be on
0.04%:  if you read and then
0.04%:  the real way to a
0.04%:  I would eat even that
0.04%:  I read a good bit on how
0.04%:  all you need to do that is give
0.04%:  then I will no
0.07%:  then I will no doubt
0.04%:  I read how to live long
0.04%:  I would have to go
0.04%:  then I for one would love it
0.04%:  all I have are
0.04%:  I love to read how to eat
0.04%:  if I have to see you
0.04%:  I would hate to get salad
0.04%:  I would eat it and then go
0.04%:  that would be very good on its
0.04%:  when I eat a
0.04%:  then no salad
0.05%:  then no salad would
0.10%:  then no salad would ever
0.04%:  I fail to see how to
0.04%:  I want to eat you!
0.04%:  that is bad and
0.04%:  that is bad and you
0.04%:  I have a fool
0.04%:  I would date
0.04%:  then all you need is for
0.04%:  that one I read on
0.04%:  then it would rate
0.04%:  I need to go read that
0.04%:  to be fair that
0.13%:  to be fair that would
0.04%:  I read how to get a full body tan in
0.04%:  I only find
0.04%:  I read how not to get a
0.04%:  I have a lot of it and
0.04%:  I would only read that in
0.04%:  I sort of have to
0.04%:  I have a tiny
0.04%:  I love salad with a
0.04%:  that would be as good of
0.04%:  I will eat you for that
0.04%:  I tell ya
0.04%:  I need to tell you what
0.04%:  I read how to tell if you and
0.04%:  all you have to do is bang
0.04%:  I read that you do
0.04%:  all I want is to have
0.04%:  that would be even sad
0.04%:  if I was in
0.04%:  I do not feel good
0.04%:  I bet if you gave that
0.04%:  if you go down to the end
0.04%:  then your salad life
0.04%:  all you ever do is eat that
0.04%:  the salad you gave
0.04%:  then I would read it 
0.04%:  all the ones
0.04%:  I have been told it is good for
0.04%:  if so I will go and read that one
0.04%:  all I want to do is get you
0.04%:  as a rule I find that
0.04%:  if you want to get laid on
0.04%:  then you will not get
0.04%:  I want to feed
0.04%:  then I for one would give
0.04%:  I love that salad too
0.04%:  if that one is
0.07%:  if that one is good
0.04%:  if so I read an
0.04%:  I tend to get
0.04%:  I find the very idea so
0.04%:  I bet if you read what
0.04%:  if I only get one salad out
0.04%:  that would be real easy if
0.04%:  then I will go and buy
0.04%:  I told you this
0.04%:  I went to your
0.04%:  if so I read how to deal
0.04%:  I have one last
0.04%:  if so I have to tell you now
0.04%:  if you want to have real
0.04%:  in the old west

0.03%:  all you had to do is be
0.03%:  all I ever want to eat is food
0.03%:  that too is an
0.03%:  I would be the only

0.03%:  I see what
0.03%:  you need to read a
0.03%:  all you had to do was not give it
0.03%:  odds are if you want

0.03%:  if you do have to read it
0.03%:  if we get
0.03%:  I have no use for it!
0.03%:  if you go over to that
0.03%:  I would not eat salad!
0.03%:  I also read how to do it
0.03%:  if I want salad then
0.03%:  that would be one last
0.03%:  I would then read it too
0.03%:  I will save
0.03%:  if you ever want to do the salad

0.03%:  that in and
0.03%:  I would find that very ob
0.03%:  I hate salad even
