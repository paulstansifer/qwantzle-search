0.20%:  I think it's hard
0.20%:  this isn
0.20%:  it's more that
0.27%:  it's more that he was
0.20%:  this last
0.20%:  it's more like he's had
0.20%:  it's more like he did
0.20%:  that's all I've got!!
0.19%:  that might've worked
0.19%:  it's made him the world
0.19%:  it's not clear
0.19%:  it's hard to know
0.19%:  I'm making that all
0.19%:  all I did
0.22%:  all I did was write
0.21%:  all I did was change
0.39%:  all I did was change the words
0.23%:  all I did was change the word
0.19%:  he never did
0.19%:  wait I'
0.19%:  I never said
0.19%:  it makes him the god
0.19%:  I like this
0.19%:  I think that's more
0.19%:  there's a slight
0.19%:  it's more his
0.19%:  I've said this
0.19%:  this rh
0.19%:  I've made him that;
0.19%:  I think he's more a
0.19%:  we don't call them
0.19%:  I think he gave
0.19%:  it's like the most
0.19%:  that was more
0.23%:  that was more like
0.19%:  he never asked
0.19%:  he's still active
0.19%:  that's the world
9.23%:  that's the world we lived
0.19%:  that's not
0.19%:  I'm making those words
0.18%:  we're living
0.18%:  that's made
0.18%:  I am
0.18%:  I think what
0.18%:  this is making me wish
0.18%:  there's lots
0.18%:  I think it was his
0.18%:  I made his
0.18%:  it's called that
0.18%:  it's more like he showed
0.18%:  the other
0.18%:  it's made him like
0.18%:  I think he's still dead
0.18%:  it's more like when
0.18%:  it was named
0.18%:  I'd like to see him
0.18%:  it's real
0.18%:  he never liked
0.18%:  I added the last line
0.18%:  he likes it
0.18%:  he called the
0.18%:  the world we live in makes
0.18%:  we're still not
0.18%:  there's a good
0.18%:  I think we missed
0.18%:  this is the most
0.18%:  it's more like an
0.18%:  I think it was more
0.18%:  this is kind
0.18%:  I might'
0.21%:  I might've mess
0.21%:  I might've made all
0.18%:  he doesn
3.27%:  he doesn't like
0.38%:  he doesn't like it
0.30%:  he doesn't have
0.28%:  he doesn't have a middle
0.20%:  he doesn't get
0.46%:  he doesn't get credit
0.18%:  that's his nick
0.18%:  it's what
0.18%:  that's a lie;
0.18%:  we call this
0.18%:  I don't like this
0.32%:  I don't like this world
0.22%:  I don't like this world we
0.18%:  it's like the hard
0.18%:  that made me
0.18%:  he's kind
0.18%:  those were
0.18%:  he got
0.17%:  he's worked
0.17%:  I might need
0.17%:  it makes him that
0.17%:  I mess
0.17%:  I think he gets
0.24%:  I think he gets credit
0.17%:  I think he gets called
0.17%:  I still have
0.17%:  in
0.17%:  I read this
0.17%:  it's math
0.17%:  what I've
0.52%:  what I've said here
0.46%:  what I've said there
0.22%:  what I've said there makes
0.17%:  this all
0.17%:  it made him win
0.26%:  it made him win the
0.17%:  the words
0.17%:  it's more like he's an
0.17%:  there's a little
0.17%:  he died in '
0.17%:  it might have made
0.17%:  now that I'
0.20%:  now that I've read
0.17%:  he's right
0.17%:  it's less
0.17%:  he's got like
0.17%:  he's still a
0.17%:  wait I think
0.17%:  I wrote all
0.17%:  he wrote it with
0.17%:  it's this whole
0.17%:  it's more like how
0.17%:  that's called the
0.17%:  he doesn't write
0.17%:  it's a weird
0.17%:  that second
0.17%:  I think it's worth
0.17%:  all the
0.17%:  it was a
0.17%:  it's worse
0.17%:  there's like no
0.17%:  most
0.17%:  there's also like
0.17%:  he wrote a
0.17%:  it's making me wish
0.17%:  it makes him the second
0.17%:  that might've made
0.17%:  this is the world we've all
0.17%:  what I've said is wrong
0.17%:  he had
0.17%:  we all know
0.17%:  who
0.25%:  who cares
0.17%:  there was like
0.17%:  I might have made it
0.17%:  I was wrong
0.17%:  I made some
0.16%:  he's still alive so he
0.16%:  he was like
0.16%:  that gives
0.16%:  he's more like a god
0.16%:  while I'm here
0.16%:  it's more like he got
0.16%:  what he said
0.16%:  I think he's still alive;
0.16%:  he doesn't care
0.16%:  this is where I'
0.16%:  we think
0.16%:  I think we've all made
0.16%:  I'm doing
0.22%:  I'm doing this
0.16%:  I'm making this last
0.16%:  he gets
0.18%:  he gets credit
0.16%:  it's the world's most
0.16%:  he never called
0.16%:  I made most
0.16%:  I got
0.16%:  he wrote it while
0.16%:  it's a thing
0.16%:  it's made him win
0.19%:  it's made him win the
0.16%:  I wrote this when
0.16%:  he's made
0.16%:  I've said this wrong
0.16%:  there's a whole song
0.16%:  it's that
0.16%:  this was all
0.16%:  I might have missed
0.16%:  I'm making the last
0.16%:  their
0.16%:  it's the third
0.16%:  it's made him the world's second
0.16%:  he's still dead
0.16%:  that's kinda gross
0.16%:  I've lost
0.31%:  I've lost track
0.16%:  there's still some
0.16%:  that's wrong; he
0.16%:  I think he missed
0.16%:  this was a
0.16%:  I think we've all agreed this
0.16%:  I've made all
0.23%:  I've made all this
0.15%:  I'm making that shit
0.15%:  it's got
0.15%:  when I said
0.15%:  now that I'm
0.15%:  I'll never
0.15%:  I've got this
0.15%:  we don't have a word
0.15%:  wait hold
0.15%:  it's more like he's the second
0.15%:  it's more like he's a dad
0.15%:  I might've added
0.17%:  I might've added the
0.15%:  it's hard to tell what's making
0.15%:  when he
0.16%:  when he wrote
0.15%:  I don't have time
0.15%:  it's an
0.15%:  that's making me
0.15%:  he has
0.15%:  it's a little weird how he
0.15%:  it's so
0.15%:  this is where I get
0.15%:  this entire
0.15%:  it's hard to know what
0.17%:  it's hard to know what'
0.15%:  this whole time I was making
0.15%:  that's more like his
0.15%:  I think the word was
0.15%:  this is all I
0.25%:  this is all I've come
0.18%:  this is all I'm
0.15%:  this is kinda
0.15%:  it's still hard
0.15%:  I threw
0.15%:  that might've come
0.15%:  it's a whole
0.15%:  it's the world we lived in last week!!
0.15%:  it's more like he had
0.15%:  there's so
0.15%:  what I've said makes
0.15%:  that's what I'
0.23%:  that's what I've
0.15%:  that's what I'm doing
0.15%:  what I've said here makes
0.15%:  I might've made this
0.15%:  I think he's still alive so
0.15%:  he's more like the middle
0.15%:  he hated
0.14%:  I'd love
0.15%:  I'd love to hear
0.14%:  I've made some
0.21%:  I've made some slight
0.15%:  I've made some slight alter
0.14%:  the name
0.14%:  I've read the
0.14%:  I made his middle
0.14%:  it never
0.14%:  I think he was more well
0.14%:  we're having
0.15%:  we're having this
0.14%:  there's still a lot we
0.14%:  that was weird
0.14%:  it's the most
0.14%:  that's a lie I
0.14%:  it's kinda the
0.14%:  what he did is
0.14%:  I've added the last line
0.14%:  I liked
0.14%:  I like this world
0.14%:  he's still alive; I'
0.14%:  it's the world we'
0.14%:  I think we've said
0.14%:  he made it
0.14%:  what he did was solve
0.14%:  he gets called
0.14%:  he's more the god
0.14%:  I tried
0.14%:  I kinda mess
0.14%:  I don't recall
0.14%:  that's all I've got;
0.14%:  it's more like a sem
0.14%:  he was a
0.14%:  that doesn
1.08%:  that doesn't work
0.73%:  that doesn't make
0.65%:  that doesn't work well
1.18%:  that doesn't work well with
0.31%:  that doesn't work with
0.21%:  that doesn't rh
0.20%:  that doesn't make him
0.15%:  that doesn't work well as
0.14%:  I made those words
0.14%:  he was never
0.14%:  I think we'd
0.14%:  he died like two
0.14%:  I've heard
0.14%:  the second is
0.14%:  it's in
0.14%:  I'm kinda glad this
0.14%:  it's hard to tell how
0.14%:  what he wrote
0.14%:  it's more that he's like
0.14%:  it's more like the second
0.14%:  I think we'd all agree
0.14%:  this makes me want
0.14%:  it makes him the world
0.16%:  it makes him the world's second
0.14%:  this is what I'
0.19%:  this is what I've
0.14%:  that was me who
0.14%:  that gives me ideas
0.14%:  it's hard to make
0.14%:  I've made it all
0.14%:  the world we live in is that
0.14%:  I think we've made
0.14%:  I might've made the
0.14%:  I made the word
0.14%:  that's where it
0.14%:  I'd still
0.40%:  I'd still like to hear
0.32%:  I'd still like to hear what
0.14%:  he solved
0.14%:  it's more like his dad
0.14%:  no wait
0.14%:  that's more like the
0.14%:  it doesn
0.74%:  it doesn't rh
0.70%:  it doesn't have
0.60%:  it doesn't make
0.73%:  it doesn't make him either
0.39%:  it doesn't work
0.38%:  it doesn't make him a
0.37%:  it doesn't work with
0.18%:  it doesn't work well
0.37%:  it doesn't work well with
0.16%:  it doesn't make him the
0.14%:  the world we live in has
0.14%:  I don't like this world we'
0.14%:  it's sort
0.14%:  I can't write
0.14%:  that's the world we'
0.14%:  it's a little weird when I
0.14%:  I read the
0.14%:  I've got a
0.14%:  I did this
0.14%:  this is all I'm doing
0.14%:  that worked
0.14%:  all the credit
0.14%:  it's the world we lived in a
0.13%:  it's more that his
0.13%:  it's the world we lived in like
0.13%:  I think it's weird
0.13%:  he's a mat
0.13%:  this seems
0.13%:  I like the
0.13%:  I might have to write
0.13%:  I don't care
0.13%:  I think that's weird
0.13%:  it was me
0.44%:  it was me who wrote
0.16%:  it was me who came
0.15%:  it was me who wrote this
0.14%:  it was me who wrote the
0.13%:  he kinda
0.13%:  I think there's a com
0.13%:  this is me
0.13%:  it's like three
0.13%:  the last word
0.13%:  he gave
0.13%:  that's like the world
0.13%:  that's all I've come
0.13%: !!
0.13%:  wait that
0.38%:  wait that's wrong
0.13%:  he calls
0.13%:  the real
0.13%:  I said
0.13%:  we're still living
0.13%:  it's called '
0.13%:  it's more like he was given
0.13%:  we're doing
0.23%:  we're doing this
0.13%:  I've kinda
0.13%:  we still need
0.13%:  he is
0.13%:  it's made him the latter
0.13%:  it's more like he was a
0.13%:  it's a term
0.13%:  I think it's more the
0.13%:  it's like the whole
0.13%:  I screw
0.13%:  this was more
0.13%:  that's less
0.13%:  it's more like he's the second dad
0.13%:  we have to
0.13%:  wait that's weird
0.13%:  it's now
0.26%:  it's now called
0.13%:  I've got this whole
0.13%:  I might have messed it
0.13%:  when I read
0.13%:  it's making him that
0.13%:  it's weird how that
0.13%:  he's still alive so he'd
0.13%:  let
0.13%:  that's a great
0.13%:  that's not right
0.13%:  it's the same word
0.13%:  it's short
0.13%:  it's more like he gets
0.13%:  this is where we
0.13%:  that's like the worst lim
0.13%:  we can
0.13%:  I might've added the last line
0.13%:  that's the world we lived in like
0.13%:  what I did
0.38%:  what I did there was make
0.36%:  what I did there is
0.29%:  what I did there was take
0.21%:  what I did there is called
0.14%:  what I did was
0.13%:  what I did there was called
0.13%:  it's not clear how
0.13%:  I don't see
0.13%:  it's the second sem
0.13%:  it's me
0.17%:  it's me who
0.18%:  it's me who's made
0.17%:  it's me who's the
0.17%:  it's me who wrote
0.13%:  that was kind
0.13%:  this is how
0.13%:  this verse
0.13%:  I think he solved
0.13%:  I think it'd
0.13%:  we don't call him a
0.13%:  it makes me
0.13%:  it's more like that
0.12%:  these were
0.12%:  it's great
0.12%:  I wish
0.12%:  even
0.12%:  I've got the
0.12%:  he's a little
0.12%:  I might've made it
0.12%:  I think he'll
0.12%:  it's like that
0.12%:  this is what I'm doing
0.12%:  it's like the least
0.12%:  these two
0.12%:  it's a little hard
0.12%:  that was like the
0.12%:  I write
0.12%:  that's worse
0.12%:  it's what he
0.15%:  it's what he did
0.12%:  that's all I've got with
0.12%:  that's where I get
0.12%:  I made the second
0.12%:  it's him
0.12%:  man
0.12%:  I might've screw
0.12%:  that seems
0.29%:  that seems like
0.15%:  that seems weird
0.12%:  I made this all
0.12%:  it's made him the god
0.12%:  that seems like a weird
0.12%:  it's more like he has
0.12%:  it's like 
0.12%:  it's still worth
0.12%:  it's a little more
0.12%:  I heard
0.12%:  it's more like he's god
0.12%:  that's like the world we
0.24%:  that's like the world we lived
0.12%:  I've no
0.41%:  I've no idea what
0.15%:  I've no idea who
0.14%:  I've no idea what the
0.13%:  I've no idea where
0.12%:  I've no idea how
0.12%:  we call him the god
0.12%:  I messed that
0.12%:  either
0.12%:  I think there's still
0.12%:  I don't like this world we've
0.12%:  I think we'd all agree that'
0.12%:  it's like the worst song
0.12%:  the title'
0.12%:  it's this weird
0.12%:  it's more like he gave the
0.12%:  this is called
0.12%:  I'm kind
0.12%:  he's still alive so we'
0.12%:  it's more like he did some
0.12%:  that's all I've got there
0.12%:  it's a weird thing
0.12%:  we're all living
0.12%:  I'm the
0.12%:  he did the
0.15%:  he did the work
0.12%:  it's the world we live in!!
0.12%:  it's like the third most
0.12%:  this is weird
0.12%:  that's right
0.12%:  he called his
0.12%:  it's still the world
0.12%:  I've got like
0.12%:  I think it's time
0.12%:  I might have missed a word
0.12%:  wait this makes
0.12%:  I don't get
0.12%:  he's more a
0.12%:  I wrote it while
0.12%:  what he did was work
0.12%:  this didn
0.12%:  it wasn
0.12%:  I think we call
0.14%:  I think we call him
0.12%:  he's still alive and worked with me at
0.12%:  I think it might'
0.12%:  it was me who made
0.12%:  a
0.12%:  his work was called
0.12%:  there's a video game called this
0.12%:  it's kinda racist
0.12%:  it's more like he came
0.12%:  that's like his
0.12%:  that's where we
0.14%:  that's where we got
0.12%:  I've got it
0.12%:  I make
0.12%:  that's him over
0.12%:  there is a
0.12%:  I've read his
0.12%:  the answer
0.11%:  we've got
0.11%:  the world is
0.11%:  it doesn't make him this
0.11%:  I think we've made him
0.11%:  he's never said what
0.11%:  what'
0.13%:  what's the
0.12%:  what's the deal
0.11%:  he doesn't write his
0.11%:  it's a lie
0.11%:  it's like this whole
0.11%:  these are the
0.11%:  I looked
0.11%:  I think we all
0.11%:  this is worse
0.11%:  the latter'
0.11%:  I wrote this with
0.11%:  his work was in
0.11%:  it's a thing where
0.11%:  he still works
0.11%:  he died a
0.11%:  here
0.12%:  here's the
0.11%:  it's wrong
0.11%:  it's kinda weird how he
0.11%:  he did it with
0.11%:  that's like a
0.11%:  I think he's died
0.11%:  the world we live in is a
0.11%:  he's still alive and wrote
0.11%:  it's hard to decide who
0.11%:  it's now called the
0.11%:  I think we'll have
0.11%:  I think we're the
0.11%:  it's also
0.11%:  this makes me wonder
0.11%:  he goes
0.11%:  he did that
0.11%:  he wrote this
0.11%:  we're making
0.23%:  we're making this
0.11%:  I've made the
0.24%:  I've made the whole
0.11%:  there's like a whole song
0.11%:  we'll
0.11%:  this makes me wish
0.20%:  this makes me wish I'd never
0.11%:  I think he's got
0.11%:  I made him the
0.11%:  that's like the world's most
0.11%:  this makes me wish I'd gone
0.11%:  we don't have the
0.11%:  I'll leave

0.39%:  while we're at it let's change
0.18%:  while we're at it let's give him
0.14%:  while we're at it I've
0.13%:  while we're at it I'd like to give
0.13%:  while we're at it we
0.24%:  while we're at it we might
0.48%:  while we're at it we might as well make
0.35%:  while we're at it we might as well add
0.21%:  while we're at it we might as well move
0.15%:  while we're at it we might as well do
0.12%:  while we're at it I might
0.11%:  I'm making a
0.11%:  I might've made all this
0.11%:  I don't see how this
0.11%:  this gives
0.11%:  this gives me a
0.11%:  I liked the
0.11%:  that gives me a
0.11%:  I think we'll leave
0.11%:  he got his
0.11%:  it's weird that he
0.47%:  it's weird that he's called
0.11%:  doctor
0.11%:  he's still with
0.11%:  while we're at it let's make
0.11%:  I'll admit this
0.11%:  I might've made those
0.11%:  some
0.11%:  this makes me wonder what
0.11%:  that's a lie I made
0.11%:  his thesis
0.11%:  it's kinda weird that he
0.97%:  it's kinda weird that he's called
0.11%:  it's a whole thing
0.11%:  that's where it comes
0.11%:  it's more like he added
0.11%:  there have
0.11%:  he gave the
0.11%:  I think it's more called
0.11%:  I'd like to see what
0.11%:  it's hard to tell who's making
0.11%:  I lied;
0.11%:  that's a little
0.52%:  that's a little weird
0.21%:  that's a little weird when
0.11%:  it's a good
0.11%:  it's more like he's given his
0.11%:  it's made him this
0.11%:  I might write
0.11%:  it doesn't work as
0.83%:  it doesn't work as well
1.08%:  it doesn't work as well with
0.21%:  it doesn't work as well as
0.11%:  while we're at it we might as well ask
0.11%:  we're doing this all
0.11%:  it's made him the world's oldest
0.11%:  I made these
0.16%:  I made these words
0.13%:  I made these things
0.11%:  it's kinda hard to tell
0.11%:  this is the world I
0.11%:  it's more like he was given the
0.11%:  it's not clear who
0.11%:  he lives
0.11%:  I read his
0.10%:  all I did was write the
0.10%:  that was his
0.10%:  I hate
0.10%:  I wrote his
0.10%:  he still lives
0.10%:  it's kinda weird how the
0.10%:  these things
0.10%:  it's his work with
0.10%:  the math
0.10%:  I mis
0.10%:  it's hard to tell with
0.10%:  that's like the worst name
0.10%:  it's kinda the worst
0.10%:  it's more like the sem
0.10%:  this will
0.10%:  he was making
0.10%:  this is a great
0.10%:  that was his middle
0.10%:  he doesn't like the
0.10%:  I've come
0.10%:  we all agree
0.10%:  it's not a
0.10%:  it made him the world
0.16%:  it made him the world's second
0.10%:  he won
0.10%:  I think it's made
0.10%:  it's god
0.10%:  when I write
0.10%:  there's a new
0.10%:  it's kinda weird how these
0.10%:  this is the world we all
0.10%:  I'm kinda glad this is
0.97%:  I'm kinda glad this is the world we'
0.11%:  I'm kinda glad this is the world we've
0.10%:  he wrote that
0.10%:  this whole time I was rec
0.10%:  that made me think
0.10%:  there's like this
0.10%:  it's weird that I
0.17%:  it's weird that I know
0.10%:  it's more like I'
0.10%:  let's never
0.10%:  this gives me ideas
0.10%:  he likes cheese
0.10%:  we've had
0.16%:  we've had this
0.10%:  he's still alive; he's 
0.10%:  he doesn't like the word
0.10%:  where
0.14%:  where did
0.20%:  where did I get this
0.16%:  where did I get that
0.10%:  it's weird that we
0.10%:  this might'
0.11%:  this might've worked
0.10%:  I like how
0.10%:  it's called hard
0.10%:  I've read it
0.10%:  wait there
0.29%:  wait there's like
0.10%:  wait that's like
0.10%:  the world we live in might
0.10%:  I think he's made more
0.10%:  his work is called
0.10%:  this is all I'm ever
0.10%:  it's the other one
0.10%:  I like this new
0.36%:  I like this new world we
0.24%:  I like this new world we'
0.13%:  I like this new world we've
0.27%:  I like this new world we've made
0.10%:  it's all I
0.10%:  it's kinda a
0.10%:  no I
0.12%:  no I'
0.10%:  that makes him one
0.10%:  the world we lived
0.20%:  the world we lived in was
0.10%:  while we're at it let's add
0.10%:  his work made
0.10%:  the world'
0.10%:  it's kinda great
0.10%:  we all know him
0.10%:  I did that
0.10%:  that's the world we lived in last
0.42%:  that's the world we lived in last week;
0.32%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I'
0.13%:  that's the world we lived in last week!!
0.12%:  that's the world we lived in last week; we
0.10%:  it's kinda weird how he's called
0.10%:  what he did was create
0.10%:  I read it
0.10%:  it's one
0.10%:  I think we've made this
0.10%:  I think we've missed
0.10%:  he said he
0.12%:  he said he liked
0.10%:  it's given
0.16%:  it's given him the
0.10%:  I have like
0.10%:  he doesn't like gr
0.10%:  we've all agreed that'
0.10%:  it's more like sem
0.10%:  we're making that
0.10%:  when he died
0.10%:  that doesn't work as
1.75%:  that doesn't work as well with
0.18%:  that doesn't work as well as I'd wished
0.11%:  that doesn't work as well as I'd wished it
0.10%:  since
0.10%:  that's all I know right
0.10%:  it's more like he didn
0.10%:  where did this
0.19%:  where did this come
0.10%:  that was the weird
0.10%:  that doesn't work well with sc
0.10%:  it's more like he's given a
0.10%:  I wrote this in
0.10%:  it's like the weird
0.10%:  this is all making
0.10%:  it's like his
0.10%:  the title is
0.10%:  we never
0.10%:  there's an
0.10%:  it's what he's most
0.10%:  he doesn't get called
0.10%:  I think we've all agreed that'
0.10%:  this is the world I'
0.10%:  while we're at it I've got
0.10%:  the two
0.10%:  I kinda wish he
0.10%:  wait this whole
0.10%:  I might've made that second
0.10%:  I wrote this song
0.29%:  I wrote this song while
0.10%:  I'm kinda glad we
0.14%:  I'm kinda glad we're still
0.10%:  I've added some
0.10%:  it's called the sem
0.10%:  he's also
0.10%:  it's the hard
0.10%:  we think he'
0.18%:  we think he's dead
0.10%:  all I did was remove
0.10%:  it's more like he's given the
0.10%:  the whole world
0.10%:  it's more like he's got
0.10%:  it's more like he was the second
0.10%:  I've no idea where this
0.10%:  it's hard to tell the
0.10%:  I think this was
0.10%:  it doesn't make him a god
0.10%:  it's come
0.10%:  he's still alive and might
0.10%:  there was no
0.10%:  I need
0.10%:  this song is called
0.10%:  we need
0.10%:  it's more called
0.10%:  I'm having a little
0.10%:  the ac
0.10%:  it's more like he's a child
0.10%:  I'm still having
0.09%:  it's not called
0.09%:  I think it was his sem
0.09%:  it's the middle
0.09%:  wait I've
0.09%:  I might have said
0.09%:  it made him this
0.09%:  he wrote his sem
0.09%:  he's the origin
0.09%:  I think the sem
0.09%:  it's worth a
0.09%:  it's making me wish I had
0.09%:  I made him write
0.09%:  we don't have time right
0.09%:  he died three
0.09%:  it's more his sem
0.09%:  he writes
0.09%:  it's like the worst thing I
0.09%:  I've made this whole
0.09%:  he doesn't seem
0.10%:  he doesn't seem like
0.09%:  that'd
0.14%:  that'd make
0.09%:  I had to make
0.09%:  this isn't a
0.09%:  that's some
0.09%:  comes
0.09%:  I think we've got
0.09%:  it's more that he's made
0.09%:  it's where
0.10%:  it's where the
0.09%:  it's all kinda
0.09%:  it's more like I've
0.09%:  I think he got
0.09%:  I'd heard
0.09%:  when I read it
0.09%:  those are the
0.09%:  I am making
0.09%:  while we're at it let's go
0.11%:  while we're at it let's go with
0.09%:  he did this
0.09%:  this whole time I've wanted
0.09%:  there isn
0.09%:  this is a lie
0.09%:  what the
0.09%:  it's more that he's well
0.09%:  I don't like how
0.15%:  I don't like how this
0.09%:  it's more like he solved the
0.09%:  he was still
0.09%:  that's all the
0.09%:  it seems
0.14%:  it seems like
0.11%:  it seems like he was
0.09%:  it's what he's called
0.09%:  I've got some
0.09%:  with
0.09%:  he's still alive so he gets
0.29%:  he's still alive so he gets to decide
0.09%:  he's still alive so he gets credit
0.09%:  this is all I know
0.09%:  his real name'
0.09%:  I think we all agree
0.09%:  this is the least
0.09%:  this might work
0.09%:  I still like the
0.09%:  it's the world we all
0.09%:  while we're at it let's give him a second
0.09%:  I've made him a
0.09%:  it was his work on the
0.09%:  no it
0.14%:  no it'
0.09%:  no it's called
0.09%:  while we're at it we might as well admit
0.09%:  it's called things
0.09%:  he was never called
0.09%:  all I'
0.17%:  all I'm doing
0.22%:  all I'm doing is rec
0.20%:  all I'm doing here
0.15%:  all I've
0.19%:  all I've done is write
0.09%:  his other
0.09%:  that's kinda weird how
0.09%:  I looked him
0.09%:  I've still
0.09%:  this whole time I'm
0.09%:  it's the latter!!
0.09%:  it's more like the god
0.09%:  it's called the '
0.09%:  he's never called
0.09%:  it's more the second
0.09%:  let's go
0.18%:  let's go with
0.09%:  it's making me a
0.09%:  I've made him into
0.09%:  I don't see how we
0.13%:  I don't see how we're still
0.19%:  I don't see how we're still alive
0.09%:  his name's like
0.09%:  I've made this all
0.09%:  that word
0.09%:  it's clear
0.09%:  that was wrong
0.09%:  I've said that
0.10%:  I've said that wrong
0.12%:  I've said that wrong twice
0.12%:  I've said that wrong like
0.09%:  I don't see what
0.15%:  I don't see what'
0.09%:  I like it
0.11%:  I like it when
0.09%:  it's all kind
0.09%:  what's the word
0.09%:  he's still alive and he wrote it
0.09%:  I might've made the second
0.09%:  there's a whole lot
0.09%:  it's more like we
0.09%:  wait I'm making
0.10%:  wait I'm making this worse
0.09%:  where did I get the
0.09%:  there's also this
0.09%:  I think he calls
0.09%:  I think it's more his
0.09%:  that's more like what
0.09%:  it's more that he made
0.09%:  I've got this all
0.09%:  that's not where
0.09%:  he's still here
0.09%:  it's some
0.09%:  it's like the world we
0.21%:  it's like the world we lived
0.09%:  he died last week and
0.09%:  it's kinda weird that we
0.12%:  it's kinda weird that we've
0.09%:  what he'
0.09%:  it's a little weird how he's named
0.09%:  it'll
0.09%:  more
0.13%:  more like
0.09%:  he asked
0.09%:  he's called that
0.09%:  I'd never call
0.09%:  it's the same word twice
0.09%:  his middle name is '
0.09%:  it makes him the world's oldest
0.09%:  I think we've all made him
0.09%:  what he's called
0.09%:  it's like the worst thing I've said
0.09%:  it's more like a child
0.09%:  it seems like he'
0.09%:  that's how we
0.09%:  it'd
0.09%:  he's a little more
0.09%:  that makes me wonder
0.09%:  I wrote these
0.09%:  that's kinda how
0.09%:  this is where we get
0.09%:  it was the word
0.09%:  it was more like the
0.09%:  what I wrote
0.09%:  this worked
0.09%:  that's all we
0.14%:  that's all we know right
0.09%:  his kids
0.09%:  his kids are called
0.09%:  this is where I got
0.08%:  it's two
0.08%:  his kids were
0.08%:  he was given
0.08%:  I like that
0.08%:  let's go with the second
0.08%:  I think it's weird how
0.08%:  it's sem
0.08%:  I think it might've made
0.08%:  there's little
0.08%:  it's making me a little sad
0.08%:  there's like ten
0.08%:  he died two
0.14%:  he died two weeks
0.08%:  it's not clear who'
0.08%:  now that I write
0.08%:  I wrote that while we
0.08%:  I think we've made that
0.08%:  he'll
0.08%:  I wanted
0.08%:  this might make a
0.08%:  he's named
0.08%:  I've no idea which
0.08%:  there might
0.08%:  it was like the
0.08%:  it's the world we lived in 
0.08%:  we made
0.08%:  while we're at it we might as well stick
0.08%:  we call his
0.08%:  he was there
0.08%:  he's still alive so I'd
0.08%:  what I did there was give
0.08%:  that's where it gets
0.08%:  the word was
0.08%:  he doesn't write like
0.08%:  his work in
0.08%:  this is the wrong
0.08%:  I'm like
0.08%:  this is now
1.15%:  this is now the world we lived
0.29%:  this is now the world we'
0.09%:  this is now the world we've all
0.08%:  that's all I've got time
0.08%:  we've called
0.13%:  we've called him
0.09%:  we've called him the
0.08%:  it's still the same world
0.08%:  it's made him a world
0.08%:  while we're at it I'd like to get
0.08%:  this is all I've read
0.08%:  it doesn't make me
0.08%:  he died like three
0.08%:  I think it was the
0.08%:  I'd like to hear what
0.08%:  there was some
0.08%:  that's all I've read
0.08%:  it made him the world's oldest
0.08%:  we think he was
0.08%:  he's more like a middle
0.24%:  he's more like a middle child
0.08%:  I think there's a mis
0.08%:  I think we've lost
0.08%:  this is making me re
0.08%:  it's the world we live in;
0.08%:  it was his mother
0.08%:  he died last week so
0.08%:  it's the world we lived in last week; we
0.08%:  this is all I'm doing with
0.08%:  he's kinda racist
0.08%:  now that I've heard
0.08%:  I'm kinda scared
0.08%:  that's all I have
0.08%:  he's in
0.08%:  I have to
0.08%:  we're still having
0.08%:  all this
0.08%:  it's more that he did
0.08%:  I liked that
0.08%:  that makes it
0.08%:  it's kinda weird how this
0.08%:  it's hard to get
0.08%:  no I made
0.08%:  it's all the same thing
0.08%:  he's doing
0.08%:  he's never liked
0.08%:  that's a thing
0.08%:  he did some
0.08%:  I think it's still
0.08%:  while we're at it let's also
0.22%:  while we're at it let's also give
0.08%:  all the credit goes to him
0.08%:  there's no sem
0.08%:  it's given him some
0.08%:  what he did was design
0.08%:  I think he added
0.08%:  I don't get how
0.08%:  he's still doing
0.08%:  there's like a whole list
0.08%:  I'd like to change
0.08%:  I made the last line
0.08%:  it's kinda sad
0.08%:  it's me who made
0.08%:  it's what he's most well
0.08%:  it's like a whole
0.11%:  it's like a whole thing
0.08%:  that doesn't work as well with '
0.08%:  it's more like he's made his
0.08%:  I can't make
0.08%:  it's hard to tell what's come
0.08%:  I think he died a
0.08%:  what I did there was like
0.08%:  we're still kinda
0.08%:  it's me who wrote this
0.08%:  all he
1.16%:  all he did was write
1.18%:  all he did was write down
1.36%:  all he did was write down the
0.68%:  all he did was write down some
0.58%:  all he did was give
0.48%:  all he did was come
0.39%:  all he did was give the
0.27%:  all he did was write the
0.26%:  all he did was write some
0.14%:  all he did was give it
0.12%:  all he did was write down some math
0.09%:  all he did was make
0.09%:  all he did was write down what
0.08%:  all he did was give some
0.08%:  all he did was solve
0.08%:  while we're at it I'd like to add
0.08%:  I don't have the time
0.08%:  he made the
0.08%:  I looked this
0.08%:  I'm making all those
0.14%:  I'm making all those words
0.08%:  he thinks
0.08%:  I will
0.09%:  I will never
0.08%:  it's made him the single
0.08%:  we still don't have the
0.08%:  this is where I'd
0.08%:  it was in
0.08%:  I'd like to have
0.08%:  I still like him
0.08%:  called
0.08%:  he was doing
0.08%:  it's weird that I'
0.08%:  let's all
0.10%:  let's all agree
0.08%:  while we're at it I might as well add
0.08%:  it's kinda awesome
0.08%:  it's the world we lived in two
0.67%:  it's the world we lived in two weeks
0.08%:  it is called
0.08%:  all I did was change the title
0.08%:  I think we've all missed
0.08%:  I wrote that down
0.13%:  I wrote that down while
0.08%:  he's like a
0.08%:  it's a thing called
0.08%:  it's closer
0.08%:  we've called him the latter
0.08%:  there's like a lot
0.08%:  now that I've said it like
0.08%:  I think he lives
0.08%:  it doesn't work as well with the middle
0.08%:  I don't like how this came
0.08%:  this is where we live
0.08%:  that's made me
0.08%:  wait he
0.09%:  wait he's still
0.08%:  he gave it
0.08%:  that comes
0.08%:  this whole time I'd
0.08%:  this all makes
0.08%:  I kinda wrote
0.08%:  we've all agreed that we
0.08%:  what I've done
0.17%:  what I've done here
0.08%:  sir
0.08%:  it was called like
0.08%:  while we're at it let's get
0.08%:  where did that
0.17%:  where did that come
0.08%:  all the credit goes to his
0.08%:  I've made that whole
0.08%:  that's gross
0.08%:  he's real
0.08%:  we might
0.12%:  we might have
0.08%:  the more
0.08%:  all I did was switch
0.08%:  it's the worst thing
0.08%:  it's making his
0.08%:  while we're at it we might as well name
0.08%:  it's more like the whole
0.08%:  I think it's called '
0.08%:  it's more him
0.08%:  I wrote this while making
0.08%:  I think he's said
0.08%:  with the
0.08%:  it's kinda sad how
0.08%:  I'd like that
0.08%:  it's more like the middle
0.24%:  it's more like the middle child
0.08%:  I've no idea what this
0.08%:  it did
0.08%:  it's still like
0.08%:  I've made him that in
0.08%:  we think he died
0.08%:  we think he's still
0.08%:  that gives me ch
0.08%:  we've all agreed that this
0.08%:  I've got like three
0.08%:  it's weird that I'm doing
0.08%:  I have no idea what'
0.08%:  it's all a
0.08%:  it's all he
0.35%:  it's all he's ever talked
0.08%:  I've said this twice
0.08%:  there's a lot we
0.08%:  he made his
0.08%:  I've no idea where that
0.08%:  here's what
0.08%:  it's almost
0.08%:  it's like eight
0.08%:  it's not clear what
0.08%:  this idea
0.08%:  that works
0.07%:  I'd like some
0.07%:  he won the
0.07%:  I'm glad
0.07%:  it's a little weird how we
0.07%:  I kinda made him
0.07%:  it's never made
0.07%:  we might have to re
0.07%:  this is making me wish we
0.07%:  what he did was like
0.07%:  we've all agreed this
0.07%:  there's like a 
0.07%:  the math is
0.07%:  it was like three
0.07%:  I don't see how he
0.07%:  all I did was make
0.07%:  which
0.07%:  I kinda wish he'd come
0.07%:  it's more that he's a
0.07%: ;
0.07%:  all these
0.08%:  all these words
0.07%:  he's still making
0.07%:  it's hard to tell when
0.07%:  it's a single
0.11%:  it's a single word
0.07%:  that's all I'm
0.07%:  the rh
0.07%:  he went
0.07%:  it was all
0.07%:  that's his real
0.22%:  that's his real middle
0.07%:  while I think
0.07%:  this is a weird
0.07%:  he's still alive; I'm making
0.07%:  I think it's his sem
0.07%:  we're all dead
0.07%:  while we're doing
0.07%:  it's all I'
0.16%:  it's all I've talked
0.11%:  it's all I've read
0.07%:  this is all I've talked
0.07%:  this isn't the
0.18%:  this isn't the world
0.07%:  it's more like he's called
0.07%:  I'll admit it
0.07%:  he's got like three
0.07%:  that's mis
0.07%:  it's over
0.07%:  this came
0.07%:  that's what it
0.11%:  that's what it'
0.13%:  that's what it's like
0.07%:  we're kinda
0.07%:  comes with
0.07%:  he got the
0.07%:  I might have to re
0.07%:  it's more like he's a second
0.07%:  I write this
0.07%:  I don't have time right
0.07%:  he likes it when
0.07%:  it's hard to make this
0.07%:  I think he dis
0.07%:  it was his mother'
0.07%:  while we're at it I'll
0.07%:  it's made him like the
0.07%:  I think he's more active
0.07%:  I don't see how this is
0.07%:  there's no '
0.07%:  there's still like a
0.07%:  what I'm doing is called
0.07%:  we think he's more
0.07%:  it's that second
0.07%:  while we're on this
0.07%:  I'm kinda tired
0.07%:  this is making the
0.07%:  he works
0.07%:  it's hard to talk
0.14%:  it's hard to talk while
0.07%:  I'd like to give
0.16%:  I'd like to give credit
0.07%:  that's his middle name!!
0.07%:  there's a second
0.07%:  it's given him more
0.07%:  his work was on
0.07%:  it's given him that
0.07%:  it's in the
0.07%:  he was right
0.07%:  while we're at it I'd love
0.07%:  I wrote this like
0.07%:  it's more like the child
0.07%:  he kind
0.07%:  I might've made those words
0.07%:  I think it's all
0.07%:  it's more like he was one
0.07%:  it doesn't have made
0.07%:  he's dead so
0.07%:  that's like the most
0.07%:  let's change
0.07%:  wait no
0.07%:  it's more like he's made the
0.07%:  he's given
0.07%:  while we're at it I might as well admit
0.07%:  I made that all
0.07%:  I'd call
0.11%:  I'd call him
0.21%:  I'd call him more
0.10%:  I'd call him more the
0.10%:  I'd call him the
0.09%:  I'd call it more
0.09%:  I'd call him more like
0.07%:  that makes him a
0.07%:  it's making me wish I was
0.07%:  he worked in
0.07%:  I wrote a
0.07%:  he got the award
0.07%:  there's a whole video
0.08%:  there's a whole video game called
0.07%:  I might have read
0.07%:  it's more like how he was
0.07%:  that makes him twice
0.07%:  he's listed
0.07%:  I've added those
0.07%:  this might've made
0.07%:  it's time
0.07%:  we called
0.09%:  we called him
0.07%:  we called him that
0.07%:  he called them
0.07%:  it's what made
0.07%:  his work had
0.09%:  his work had little
0.07%:  wait there's like twelve
0.07%:  his work wasn
0.07%:  it's all he's worked
0.07%:  it was me who called
0.07%:  it's kinda weird how that
0.07%:  I've had
0.07%:  he never talks
0.07%:  it made him the latter
0.07%:  that's kinda where
0.07%:  it's more like he was the god
0.07%:  it's his work that
0.12%:  it's his work that made
0.07%:  I've made him that!!
0.07%:  I might write this
0.07%:  it's still more
0.07%:  he's still alive; we
0.07%:  we'll never
0.07%:  it's what he wrote
0.07%:  I made them
0.07%:  we call him a
0.07%:  he's kinda the
0.07%:  it's made him an
0.07%:  he did that work
0.07%:  he's died
0.09%:  he's died since
0.07%:  it's the last
0.07%:  what he called
0.07%:  I've heard it
0.13%:  I've heard it called
0.07%:  I'm making his
0.07%:  it's the title
0.07%:  this works
0.07%:  it's all right
0.07%:  I'm making the rest
0.07%:  his work on
0.07%:  I made him the second
0.07%:  I'd like to write
0.07%:  made
0.10%:  made him the
0.07%:  we had
0.07%:  I might have made all
0.07%:  we might want
0.07%:  it's made him a lot
0.07%:  we all know he
0.07%:  that's the wrong sem
0.07%:  it's more math
0.07%:  I think we've made this worse
0.07%:  that's the world we'd
0.07%:  we've called the
0.07%:  it's kinda great how
0.07%:  it doesn't work well with sc
0.07%:  that's what killed
0.07%:  I don't see where
0.07%:  this is making me a
0.07%:  it's all I've got
0.07%:  it's a video
0.89%:  it's a video game where
0.12%:  it's a video game called
0.07%:  I think he's more called
0.07%:  his work made him a
0.07%:  I don't have a degree
0.07%:  I'd still like to see
0.07%:  that was me who did
0.07%:  I'd call him more like the
0.07%:  where did this song
0.07%:  it's more like what he
0.10%:  it's more like what he did was give
0.07%:  it's more like what he did was come
0.07%:  it's more like a god
0.07%:  his whole
0.07%:  this is like the worst song
0.07%:  this is the world we'd
0.07%:  I can't read
0.07%:  it has made him a
0.07%:  there's a thing
0.07%:  he was named
0.07%:  all I did there
0.09%:  all I did there was switch
0.07%:  it's the name
0.07%:  this song'
0.07%:  I think there's two
0.07%:  it's a math
0.07%:  it's a math thing
0.07%:  the word '
0.07%:  having
0.07%:  we're all kinda
0.07%:  it made him what
0.07%:  it's a little weird how the
0.07%:  it's weird to
0.07%:  I'd still like some
0.07%:  that was me who wrote it
0.07%:  he's dead and
0.07%:  it's a word
0.07%:  I'm a
0.08%:  I'm a little scared
0.07%:  the name'
0.07%:  he's the god
0.07%:  while we're at it we might as well take
0.24%:  while we're at it we might as well take down
0.07%:  these are all
0.07%:  he's the latter
0.07%:  it's a little weird how he's got
0.07%:  how
0.07%:  that's the world we lived in a
0.09%:  that's the world we lived in a week
0.07%:  I can't get
0.07%:  I made all those
0.07%:  I made all those words
0.07%:  I've read like
0.07%:  hold
0.07%:  this is the real
0.07%:  I think it's more a
0.07%:  I'm kinda glad this whole
0.07%:  we still have to
0.07%:  he's still alive so we might
0.07%:  I wrote that when
0.07%:  I'm doing this whole
0.07%:  let's call
0.07%:  still
0.07%:  I think it's made him a
0.07%:  it's when
0.07%:  I've got to
0.07%:  what he did was write a sem
0.07%:  we don't call him that;
0.52%:  we don't call him that; it's weird
0.16%:  we don't call him that; we
0.09%:  we don't call him that; it's like
0.07%:  this doesn
0.91%:  this doesn't make
0.73%:  this doesn't work
0.48%:  this doesn't make him
0.37%:  this doesn't work well
0.54%:  this doesn't work well with
0.18%:  this doesn't work with
0.10%:  this doesn't work well as a lim
0.10%:  this doesn't work as
0.96%:  this doesn't work as well
0.78%:  this doesn't work as well with
0.09%:  this doesn't make me
0.08%:  this doesn't rh
0.07%:  we never called
0.07%:  this whole talk
0.07%:  this is making me real
0.07%:  I think it was called the
0.07%:  the latter was
0.07%:  I think he goes
0.07%:  his work led
0.06%:  it's more like two
0.06%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I'd
0.06%:  we've made
0.08%:  we've made him
0.17%:  we've made him that
0.06%:  it's making him dead
0.06%:  I think that's a weird
0.06%:  it's more like one
0.06%:  I think there was some
0.06%:  it's a made
0.06%:  it's more like he'd
0.06%:  it gave
0.11%:  it gave him the
0.06%:  I made that rh
0.06%:  it's more like he's dead
0.06%:  this was the wrong
0.06%:  his work has little
0.06%:  that's kinda awesome
0.06%:  what I've done here is take
0.06%:  it's more that he gave
0.06%:  he's more like a dad
0.06%:  no I've
0.06%:  I made the last word
0.06%:  it's more like he's second
0.06%:  he liked it
0.06%:  did
0.06%:  it's more like math
0.06%:  it's weird how these
0.06%:  I can't write this
0.06%:  the answer'
0.06%:  I've made it worse
0.06%:  it's more that his sem
0.06%:  I'm still making
0.08%:  I'm still making this
0.06%:  this is more like
0.06%:  what I've done is write
0.06%:  it's either
0.06%:  what I wrote was
0.06%:  it's me who gets
0.12%:  it's me who gets credit
0.06%:  I've mis
0.06%:  all he did was write down some the
0.06%:  this doesn't seem
0.25%:  this doesn't seem like
0.06%:  it's the same with
0.06%:  I've no idea how this
0.06%:  I kinda wish we
0.13%:  I kinda wish we were
0.11%:  I kinda wish we lived
0.06%:  it's hard to tell what's coming
0.06%:  I'll leave the
0.06%:  it's like he
0.06%:  it still
0.10%:  it still makes
0.06%:  this was like
0.06%:  I've heard this
0.06%:  he's said
0.06%:  wait that's the
0.12%:  wait that's the wrong
0.06%:  that was him
0.06%:  he never said that
0.06%:  there's now
0.06%:  I'm kinda glad we solved
0.07%:  I'm kinda glad we solved this
0.06%:  I think he's still a
0.06%:  it's a video game where the
0.06%:  I think he's dead!!
0.06%:  I don't like how this is
0.06%:  I'd like to clar
0.06%:  when it
0.40%:  when it comes right
0.06%:  it's his doctor
0.06%:  he did write
0.06%:  I think it's clear
0.06%:  that's some weird
0.06%:  it's '
0.06%:  I think he did some
0.06%:  we call them things
0.06%:  all I've got
0.11%:  all I've got is this
0.06%:  I might need to work
0.06%:  I might have some
0.06%:  it's more like him
0.06%:  I'm making those last
0.06%:  while we're at it I might as well ask
0.06%:  this was like the worst
0.06%:  it's still kinda
0.06%:  I think we'll go
0.06%:  I might have come
0.06%:  we've had that
0.06%:  the term
0.06%:  we still have like
0.06%:  it's a lot
0.06%:  there wasn
0.06%:  this isn't the world we'
0.06%:  he died last week;
0.06%:  I think that's all
0.06%:  I've said this wrong twice
0.06%:  his work'
0.06%:  this is making me sad!!
0.06%:  I think he's dead so
0.06%:  I've got the whole
0.06%:  wait what
0.06%:  we never called it
0.06%:  it's a movie
0.06%:  I lied; he
0.06%:  he's alive and works
0.06%:  I did the
0.06%:  this made me write
0.06%:  it's more like the dad
0.08%:  it's more like the dad who
0.06%:  this has made me write
0.06%:  it's more like he's had some
0.06%:  I'd like to see the
0.08%:  I'd like to see the world
0.06%:  I'll never get
0.06%:  I'd like to see his
0.06%:  that'd make him one
0.06%:  I'd like to see this
0.06%:  all he did was derive
0.06%:  I kinda wish there
0.06%:  it was me who said
0.06%:  it's read
0.06%:  as
0.06%:  all I know is he
0.06%:  it has given
0.06%:  I think he writes
0.06%:  I might've made that last line
0.06%:  he was asked
0.06%:  it's the work
0.06%:  it's said
0.06%:  it's like when
0.06%:  it's more like he was doing
0.06%:  now that I've said this
0.06%:  I still think
0.06%:  wait I made
0.06%:  this is where I'd like
0.06%:  we've all made
0.07%:  we've all made him
0.06%:  I get
0.06%:  it did make
0.21%:  it did make him that
0.06%:  I think it made
0.06%:  I made the whole last
0.06%:  there's all
0.06%:  I'd like to see where
0.09%:  I'd like to see where this leads
0.06%:  I think we call them
0.06%:  I've kind
0.06%:  his doctor
0.06%:  I think he's called a
0.06%:  this goes
0.06%:  he's dead now!!
0.06%:  all I did was write some
0.06%:  it's more a met
0.06%:  what I did was write
0.06%:  it's hard to talk while eating
0.06%:  the rest
0.06%:  I might have lied
0.06%:  he's more the dad
0.06%:  the word I
0.06%:  all I did was change the word '
0.06%:  I've heard that
0.06%:  that is the
0.06%:  I did this whole
0.06%:  it's kinda hard to get
0.06%:  that's all I wrote
0.06%:  I'm making that whole last
0.06%:  it's hard to tell them
0.06%:  he's still alive so I might
0.06%:  he's still alive I'
0.06%:  it's called other
0.06%:  that's kinda the
0.06%:  I did it
0.06%:  I did it wrong

0.08%:  he does like
0.06%:  it's more like a middle
0.07%:  it's more like a middle child who
0.08%:  it's more like a middle child who gets
0.06%:  this doesn't seem like a great
0.06%:  no he
0.06%:  it's hard to come

0.06%:  that's the worst lim
0.06%:  it was me who did
0.08%:  it was me who did the
0.06%:  that made me sick
0.06%:  it's kinda weird to
0.06%:  he did the work in
0.06%:  all I did was write down
0.06%:  wait I've got
0.07%:  wait I've got this
0.06%:  this is all making me cr
0.06%:  the doctor
0.06%:  it's where he came
0.06%:  I kinda hate
0.06%:  all I've got is the
0.06%:  that's the work

0.06%:  we call his work
0.06%:  when I wrote
0.09%:  when I wrote this
0.06%:  this was the worst

0.06%:  all he did was solve the
0.06%:  he's also worked
0.06%:  that's where I'
0.06%:  I kinda threw
0.06%:  that made his
0.06%:  that made his work

0.08%:  this seems like it might
0.07%:  this seems like it'd
0.06%:  he's a great
0.06%:  it's all we
0.06%:  I'd have
0.06%:  all he did was write down what we
0.06%:  I lied that
0.06%:  this is all I've done
0.10%:  this is all I've done with
0.06%:  this is some
0.06%:  I kinda wish this
0.11%:  I kinda wish this were
0.06%:  we don't call him a god
0.06%:  we call the whole
0.06%:  that was like the weird
0.06%:  he doesn't talk
0.06%:  I've had this song

0.09%:  he's alive and still works
0.06%:  I've no idea what his
0.06%:  it gave rise
0.06%:  he was more well

0.06%:  I made him write this
0.06%:  he missed
0.06%:  it made him like
0.06%:  I think we've all made this
0.10%:  I think we've all made this worse
0.06%:  I might've made the last line
0.06%:  what I'm doing here is c
0.06%:  he's making
0.06%:  he's never asked
0.06%:  he did this work
0.06%:  he doesn't get credit with
0.06%:  this song was
0.06%:  he's more like an
0.06%:  it's weird how the
0.06%:  his kids were called
0.06%:  didn
0.06%:  while we're at it I've got some
0.06%:  what he did was derive
0.06%:  it's a series
0.06%:  god
0.06%:  I was never
0.06%:  how did
0.06%:  how did we even
0.23%:  how did we even get here
0.06%:  there's still like 
0.06%:  those were two
0.06%:  that makes me sad
0.06%:  I think we've all heard
0.06%:  wait this might
0.06%:  I kinda made this
0.06%:  it's kinda weird how we
0.06%:  it's called the time
0.06%:  I made that word
0.06%:  he never said the
0.06%:  his thesis was more
0.06%:  he did write that
0.06%:  he was more the
0.06%:  I'm more
0.06%:  that's weird and
0.06%:  this gives me some
0.06%:  all I've done is make
0.06%:  I don't like where
0.06%:  it's also called
0.06%:  he's still alive and wrote the
0.06%:  this is a weird thing
0.06%:  it's more like he's the middle
0.06%:  he comes
0.06%:  he died last night
0.06%:  she
0.06%:  I can't tell
0.06%:  let's move
0.06%:  there's now like
0.06%:  it's the weird
0.06%:  it's a mis
0.06%:  I mean
0.06%:  I might still
0.06%:  it's like the world's oldest
0.06%:  he's now
0.06%:  he's now dead
0.06%:  I might've made it all
0.06%:  I got this
0.06%:  I might have called
0.06%:  that doesn't work at
0.06%:  I think this is a
0.06%:  he's right now
0.06%:  I think he did more
0.06%:  I'm doing it
0.06%:  these lines
0.08%:  these lines were
0.06%:  he's still alive and he's got
0.06%:  it's the wrong
0.06%:  I'll have
0.06%:  I have no idea who'
0.06%:  I've said this wrong like
0.06%:  it's hard to decide what's we
0.06%:  that kind
0.06%:  I have this
0.07%:  I have this weird
0.06%:  this will make
0.07%:  this will make him
0.06%:  what I've said so
0.06%:  in the
0.06%:  it's weird that we call
0.07%:  it's weird that we call him
0.06%:  I don't like his
0.06%:  we've still
0.07%:  we've still got the

0.06%:  what it
0.37%:  what it's done is make
0.24%:  what it's done is made
0.19%:  what it's done is give
0.18%:  what it's done is made him get
0.17%:  what it's made

0.15%:  what it did was make
0.08%:  what it did was make him get
0.07%:  what it's done is make him world

0.06%:  what it's made him is one
0.06%:  what it did was give the
0.06%:  that's a lie; I
0.06%:  all I did was read
0.06%:  this is what we
0.06%:  I wrote this while sick
0.06%:  the world we live in seems
0.06%:  he's still alive and there
0.06%:  it's the world we lived in a week
0.06%:  it's weird when
0.06%:  I think we might'
0.11%:  I think we might've missed
0.08%:  I think we might've made
0.06%:  it was him
0.06%:  it's a gender
0.06%:  I lied when
0.06%:  it's a video game with
0.06%:  that's less weird
0.06%:  what's weird
0.08%:  what's weird is that I
0.05%:  I might've added some
0.05%:  I think there's a sem
0.05%:  his name might
0.05%:  he was called the
0.05%:  wait there's no
0.05%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I was
0.05%:  I might've made that all
0.05%:  it's made him either
0.05%:  that might've made it worse!!
0.05%:  it made him get
0.05%:  I've tried
0.05%:  the world we live in is that we
0.08%:  the world we live in is that we'
0.05%:  I think we're good

0.05%:  the last line was
0.10%:  the last line was added
0.05%:  it's like eight words
0.05%:  that's like 
0.05%:  it was the whole
0.05%:  this doesn't work at
0.05%:  I think we've all agreed to
0.05%:  it was more like he
0.05%:  it was the sem
0.05%:  I did write
0.05%:  it's a little weird how he gets
0.05%:  it's the second word
0.05%:  he died like 
0.05%:  that's the most
0.05%:  that's the word
0.05%:  he gave it the
0.05%:  while we're at it let's talk

0.07%:  I'd like to see how this
0.05%:  this made me sad
0.05%:  it's more like he did the
0.05%:  this might all
0.05%:  it's more like his second
0.05%:  I liked this
0.05%:  it's kinda awesome how
0.05%:  I'd love to hear him
0.05%:  I'd call it more like
0.05%:  this is where I've
0.05%:  I've screw

0.10%:  it's kinda weird how he gets called
0.05%:  I wrote that whole
0.05%:  that's the world we live in;
0.05%:  it's what he called
0.05%:  the work
0.06%:  the work was
0.05%:  I'd like to get
0.05%:  this verse was
0.05%:  that's the end
0.05%:  now I

0.05%:  that's like the least
0.05%:  I don't have his
0.05%:  that's how it
0.05%:  he's still doing work

0.08%:  we're all doing this
0.05%:  it's the same words
0.05%:  it was a sem
0.05%:  there's a whole w

0.05%:  it's the world we lived in last time
0.05%:  when I write this
0.05%:  all I did was switch the
0.05%:  this all came
0.05%:  I kinda wrote this
0.05%:  I wrote this while st
0.05%:  what's weird is that I'
0.08%:  what's weird is that I've
0.05%:  all I know is that he's dead
0.05%:  this is the world we lived in last

0.05%:  what it's done is give him some
0.05%:  he died last month
0.05%:  it's a crime
0.05%:  I might've messed it
0.05%:  I have the
0.05%:  he's still alive; he'd
0.05%:  making
0.05%:  we're making him
0.05%:  I've made some slight ed
0.05%:  it's weird how this
0.05%:  this is the world we'll
0.05%:  I'm glad we
0.05%:  I was k
0.05%:  he's kinda more
0.05%:  we're still making

0.05%:  it's like a thing
0.17%:  it's like a thing where
0.05%:  I have made
0.05%:  he's still alive; I think
0.05%:  it's a real thing!!

0.05%:  that's all we'
0.11%:  that's all we've got time
0.05%:  I'll have to write
0.05%:  each
0.05%:  right
0.05%:  he's given credit
0.05%:  these lines were added
0.05%:  this is coming
0.05%:  it was more like a
0.05%:  we don't like
0.05%:  it's a little weird how I'm making
0.05%:  this line
0.05%:  it's more like he made the
0.05%:  it's me who wrote the
0.05%:  it's the 
0.05%:  we don't care
0.05%:  we know
0.05%:  that's making it worse
0.05%:  he died like eight
0.05%:  he's still alive too
0.05%:  I'd like to hear his
0.05%:  his kids were called that
0.05%:  I lied and

0.05%:  have
0.05%:  he also
0.13%:  he also worked
0.07%:  he also worked with
0.05%:  that's like the worst song
0.05%:  he's still alive so that
0.61%:  he's still alive so that's weird
0.05%:  we don't talk
0.05%:  it's cooked
0.05%:  it makes me wonder
0.09%:  it makes me wonder what
0.05%:  now that I've read this
0.05%:  while we're at it might
0.06%:  while we're at it might as well make
0.05%:  he still gets
0.05%:  what's weird is how
0.05%:  I know this is
0.05%:  it's called the whole
0.05%:  he's still alive and worked at the
0.05%:  this was his
0.05%:  I don't care what
0.05%:  I'll take
0.05%:  these words have
0.05%:  that made it
0.05%:  this is making me wish I'd read
0.05%:  he's still alive so he's more
0.05%:  this is where I come
0.05%:  now I've said this
0.05%:  I'm still kind
0.05%:  that's made me think
0.05%:  I think he's real
0.05%:  when I read this
0.05%:  there's a sem
0.05%:  it's more like he's a dad who
0.05%:  whoah
0.05%:  that gave
0.05%:  let's stick
0.19%:  let's stick with the
0.05%:  he's had
0.05%:  wait that makes
0.05%:  I'd like to get this
0.05%:  it's the world we lived in last week I
0.05%:  while we're at it I think we'
0.05%:  he's a real
0.05%:  I've lied
0.05%:  what I said is
0.06%:  what I said is wrong
0.05%:  I've kinda made
0.06%:  I've kinda made him
0.05%:  it's given him a lot
0.05%:  he's worked in
0.05%:  he's still alive; he was
0.05%:  I've read this
0.05%:  I made all these
0.06%:  I made all these words
0.05%:  all he did was give me
0.05%:  this doesn't seem like the
0.08%:  this doesn't seem like the world
0.06%:  this doesn't seem like the world we'
0.05%:  I might have miss
0.05%:  these were all
0.05%:  the whole world is
0.05%:  this is making him
0.05%:  I've no idea what his sem
0.05%:  we're like
0.05%:  it's me who said
0.05%:  I think the world
0.07%:  I think the world we
0.05%:  there's that
0.05%:  I might have word
0.05%:  it's all wrong
0.05%:  it might make
0.05%:  that's more like his middle
0.05%:  we still have to decide
0.05%:  we still have to decide what
0.05%:  it's the world we lived in while
0.05%:  I've no idea what he
0.39%:  I've no idea what he's like
0.11%:  I've no idea what he's worked
0.09%:  I've no idea what he did
0.05%:  he's in the
0.10%:  he's in the middle
0.05%:  this whole idea'
0.05%:  all he wrote
0.05%:  he said he didn
0.05%:  this is making me less
0.05%:  all I did was write this
0.05%:  I had the
0.05%:  all he did was sketch
0.05%:  it's still the world we'
0.05%:  I think he comes
0.05%:  this is all I ever
0.05%:  it's the world we'll
0.05%:  all he did was show
0.05%:  that's how it works
0.05%:  what he did was talk
0.05%:  there's like two things called
0.05%:  he doesn't like his
0.05%:  I've got that
0.05%:  that'll
0.05%:  I never liked
0.05%:  I think it's this
0.05%:  he's given the
0.05%:  he's still alive; he's worked
0.05%:  there's almost
0.05%:  it's more like what I
0.05%:  it's a lot more
0.05%:  I like this new world a
0.05%:  this is making it
0.07%:  this is making it worse
0.05%:  I think he's still alive so we'
0.05%:  this whole time we
0.07%:  this whole time we were
0.05%:  we never call
0.05%:  it never made
0.05%:  it's weird how he
0.05%:  I've no idea who the
0.05%:  he made that
0.05%:  it's me who likes
0.05%:  we've all agreed to switch
0.05%:  I don't recall how
0.05%:  it's more like god
0.05%:  he's still alive and writes
0.05%:  all he did was work
0.05%:  I'm glad we talked
0.10%:  I'm glad we talked this
0.05%:  there's kinda
0.05%:  I wrote all this
0.05%:  it's all the other
0.05%:  he might like
0.05%:  it's a clever
0.05%:  it was like the third
0.05%:  it's kinda more
0.05%:  he might'
0.07%:  he might've said
0.05%:  he might've called
0.05%:  this is made
0.05%:  I think it's closer
0.05%:  I think the words
0.05%:  we've had the
0.05%:  there's still no
0.05%:  I'd like to go
0.05%:  he named
0.05%:  I'd kinda
0.05%:  it's their
0.05%:  that's when
0.05%:  it's hard to give
0.05%:  it's the doctor
0.05%:  what he did was called
0.05%:  it's more what
0.05%:  what it's done is make him a
0.05%:  it's more well
0.05%:  this was the worst idea
0.09%:  this was the worst idea I've come
0.05%:  that gave me ch
0.05%:  I wrote the last
0.05%:  it's kinda hard to tell what
0.05%:  all he did was write some code
0.05%:  I think he's more a god
0.05%:  I've said that wrong like twice
0.05%:  it's a little weird how we'
0.05%:  all I did was take
0.05%:  it's a little weird how he's made
0.05%:  wait!!

0.05%:  let me
0.05%:  all I know is he's dead
0.05%:  we've made that
0.05%:  we've still got a
0.05%:  I think it's the same
0.05%:  this is all a
0.05%:  he's kinda old
0.05%:  what he did is more
0.05%:  it's kinda weird that he's got
0.05%:  there's this movie
0.25%:  there's this movie called
0.05%:  it's all there
0.05%:  it came
0.05%:  it's like he's the
0.05%:  I've done
0.05%:  it's made me
0.05%:  he was kind
0.05%:  I'm doing this all
0.05%:  I wrote that while making
0.05%:  I think we made
0.05%:  we named
0.05%:  it's clear he
0.05%:  I think he'd still
0.05%:  it's more like when he
0.07%:  it's more like when he was
0.05%:  his work was on the
0.05%:  that's his work
0.05%:  he's still alive so there
0.05%:  it's good
0.05%:  I think he was a
0.05%:  it's kinda weird that we've got
0.05%:  it's weird that I'm making
0.05%:  all he did was write down a
0.05%:  it's his middle
0.05%:  I think it's more him
0.05%:  it's more like he's still
0.05%:  it'd make
0.05%:  it's making him the latter
0.05%:  more like the
0.05%:  i
0.05%:  do
0.05%:  it's more like he's named
0.05%:  right now he
0.05%:  he's alive right
0.05%:  this makes the
0.05%:  it is the
0.05%:  it's made him what
0.05%:  let's get
0.05%:  he also did
0.05%:  it still makes him that
0.05%:  it's doctor
0.05%:  it's more like he's a sem
0.05%:  we called him the
0.05%:  he was more like the god
0.05%:  it's more like having
0.05%:  it's more like he's given some
0.05%:  it's where he got
0.05%:  this is the worst I
0.05%:  this is the worst I've done
0.05%:  this is me making
0.05%:  that's the second
0.05%:  there's a lot we still
0.05%:  it's more like the last
0.05%:  it's the two
0.05%:  I wrote that while sick
0.05%:  we call that the
0.05%:  there's like one
0.05%:  wait he's dead
0.05%:  we don't call the
0.05%:  I've mess
0.06%:  I've messed this
0.05%:  I've messed that
0.05%:  what it's made him is dead
0.05%:  I wrote this as
0.05%:  he still goes
0.05%:  it's a video game now
0.05%:  I don't see what's so great
0.05%:  wait I didn
0.05%:  I might've made this all
0.05%:  I'm kinda sad
0.05%:  I think we've all had
0.05%:  he's called a
0.05%:  I think we've all lost
0.05%:  all I've said
0.05%:  I'd heard it
0.06%:  I'd heard it was called
0.06%:  I'd heard it was the
0.05%:  let's ignore
0.05%:  he likes them
0.05%:  it's like the worst name
0.05%:  it's more like he made his
0.05%:  it's more that he liked
0.05%:  I don't get where
0.05%:  it's 
0.05%:  this is all wrong;
0.05%:  this is all wrong; I'
0.07%:  this is all wrong; I've
0.05%:  it's more like he got his
0.05%:  no it's like
0.05%:  we don't have a term
0.05%:  what I was
0.05%:  he's like the second
0.05%:  this is the world we lived in a
0.06%:  this is the world we lived in a week
0.05%:  there's twelve
0.05%:  it's more like a dad
0.05%:  he gave his
0.05%:  he likes gr
0.05%:  I think he's made it
0.05%:  we have no idea what
0.05%:  it'd make more sense with
0.05%:  things
0.06%:  things were
0.05%:  it'd make him
0.05%:  it'd make him the
0.05%:  it's a little weird how he's given
0.05%:  it's a met
0.05%:  he calls it the
0.05%:  I've heard it's called
0.05%:  he's still alive; he's coming
0.05%:  what's more
0.05%:  he'll never
0.05%:  this is making me wish we were
0.05%:  that's the real
0.05%:  we've all agreed this is the
0.05%:  he doesn't work
0.05%:  what he did was give some
0.05%:  what am
0.06%:  what am I doing
0.09%:  what am I doing with
0.05%:  what am I doing here
0.05%:  that's still the
0.05%:  its
0.05%:  I've made most
0.05%:  this doesn't seem right
0.05%:  I can't see
0.05%:  that gives him
0.05%:  we're still asking
0.05%:  it makes him this
0.05%:  I wasn
0.05%:  we've still got like
0.05%:  it's more like I made
0.05%:  all I've done is write the
0.05%:  he's older
0.05%:  it's the world we lived in the
0.05%:  there's kind
0.05%:  he was given the title
0.05%:  I think he's come
0.05%:  this is where I came
0.05%:  is
0.07%:  is there
0.05%:  it's called the word
0.05%:  while we're at it let's have
0.05%:  it's him who
0.05%:  the origin
0.05%:  I'd love to hear his
0.05%:  it's not clear how we
0.05%:  that's a real
0.05%:  I'ma
0.05%:  he liked cheese
0.05%:  we still have some
0.07%:  we still have some work
0.05%:  what I said there was like
0.05%:  I might have added some
0.05%:  we live in a world with
0.05%:  he's since
0.05%:  the world we live in is this
0.05%:  it was him who
0.05%:  I never said he
0.05%:  I never said he liked
0.05%:  I was making the
0.05%:  it's me who's one
0.05%:  I'm almost
0.05%:  it's the god
0.05%:  there's this video game I
0.05%:  I kinda wish he'd made
0.05%:  I tried making
0.05%:  wait he didn
0.05%:  he's had like
0.05%:  I'm less
0.05%:  he was asking
0.05%:  strike
0.05%:  that's the world we lived in 
0.05%:  we live in the world we'
0.05%:  it's worked
0.05%:  this is the world we lived in ages
0.05%:  the name is
0.05%:  that's like the worst ac
0.05%:  it's still there
0.05%:  he solved it
0.05%:  what it's made him is world
0.05%:  it's weird that I've
0.05%:  that seems like it
0.14%:  that seems like it'd
0.07%:  that seems like it might
0.05%:  I think he's closer
0.05%:  that's wrong; he's called
0.05%:  what it's done is made him world
0.05%:  that's real
0.05%:  I think we're good with
0.05%:  it's like the worst case
0.05%:  I think it's worse
0.05%:  I've made him that since
0.05%:  I think he co
0.05%:  I think we missed a
0.06%:  I think we missed a word
0.05%:  that's wrong; he was
0.05%:  this makes it
0.05%:  we named him
0.05%:  he makes
0.05%:  this is making me weird
0.05%:  I saw
0.05%:  I think the real
0.05%:  I've got no
0.18%:  I've got no idea what this
0.16%:  I've got no idea what his
0.15%:  I've got no idea where
0.21%:  I've got no idea where this
0.20%:  I've got no idea where this came
0.14%:  I've got no idea what the
0.13%:  I've got no idea which
0.11%:  I've got no idea what'
0.10%:  I've got no idea where that
0.08%:  I've got no idea what his middle
0.08%:  I've got no idea what he
0.66%:  I've got no idea what he's like
0.10%:  I've got no idea what he did
0.07%:  I've got no idea what he's like!!
0.07%:  I've got no idea which is
0.07%:  I've got no idea what he's talked
0.07%:  I've got no idea what his sem
0.05%:  he's still alive; we'
0.05%:  that makes his
0.05%:  wait it
0.08%:  wait it's called
0.05%:  wait it's the
0.05%:  wait it's called the
0.05%:  I've made him that; it
0.05%:  the second word
0.05%:  wrote
0.05%:  he did it while
0.05%:  it's like what
0.05%:  this is the world we lived in 
0.05%:  it's weird how that came
0.05%:  I will admit
0.05%:  I like him
0.05%:  there's like eight d
0.05%:  this doesn't work as a lim
0.05%:  we're moving
0.05%:  I can't hear
0.05%:  there's a whole class
0.05%:  this is all I'm ever doing
0.05%:  I've no idea who this
0.05%:  it makes me sad
0.05%:  the thing
0.05%:  he's dead now;
0.05%:  it's kinda weird how the two
0.05%:  we'd
0.05%:  I added those
0.05%:  I've gotta
0.05%:  I think the world we lived
0.05%:  his work was with
0.05%:  I'd like to give this
0.05%:  I lied there was
0.05%:  it's this song
0.05%:  I've no idea what he's like!!
0.05%:  I like how that
0.05%:  I called
0.05%:  while I was
0.05%:  I'd like to hear him
0.05%:  I'd still like to hear his
0.05%:  I'd still like to hear his views
0.05%:  I've got a whole
0.05%:  we don't call him this
0.05%:  it's hard to decide what makes
0.05%:  it's the second most
0.05%:  there's still a whole
0.05%:  where'
0.05%:  it's called what
0.05%:  I don't see how this makes
0.05%:  he's more like one
0.05%:  it's weird to call
0.05%:  I'd read
0.05%:  he's come
0.05%:  I'd advise
0.05%:  I missed
0.04%:  I wrote that last
0.04%:  it's worth the
0.04%:  we had this
0.04%:  while we're at it this
0.04%:  he said it
0.04%:  it's still a work
0.04%:  what's wrong
0.39%:  what's wrong with me
0.04%:  these were his
0.04%:  all those
0.05%:  all those words
0.04%:  it's the math
0.04%:  I wrote it down
0.04%:  what I did there is make
0.04%:  he got it
0.04%:  it's more that he did some
0.04%:  he showed
0.04%:  that's still weird
0.04%:  this is how we
0.04%:  this is making me lose
0.04%:  the two have
0.04%:  I've made them
0.04%:  it's all down
0.04%:  it's making me real
0.04%:  I heard he
0.04%:  what I did there was m
0.04%:  more like his
0.04%:  I don't see how we'd
0.04%:  it was like this
0.04%:  these last
0.10%:  these last two lines were
0.63%:  these last two lines were added
0.04%:  it's the reason
0.04%:  he's a doctor
0.04%:  that's wrong!!
0.04%:  I still like him more
0.04%:  this is all the
0.04%:  it's more that he's given
0.04%:  he made this
0.04%:  it's kinda how
0.04%:  it's making me sad how
0.04%:  we're making it
0.04%:  this doesn't work well with a
0.04%:  that's kinda racist!!
0.04%:  that's awesome
0.04%:  I think he dies
0.04%:  it's his name
0.04%:  I take
0.04%:  it made him the second ever
0.04%:  he did work
0.04%:  I wrote this while we
0.04%:  while we're at it the
0.04%:  I heard this
0.04%:  I've got no idea what this is
0.04%:  his kids were named that
0.04%:  who knows
0.04%:  it's hard to decide how
0.04%:  in this
0.05%:  in this world
0.04%:  it's made him kind
0.04%:  he gets called the
0.04%:  it's more like he's a middle
0.16%:  it's more like he's a middle child
0.04%:  it's not hard
0.04%:  I have some
0.04%:  I think it was 
0.04%:  that's like the worst line
0.04%:  we might have to call
0.04%:  I'm making the word
0.04%:  I've messed it
0.04%:  what's weird is that we
0.04%:  he's still alive!! I
0.04%:  the idea
0.04%:  his work is called the
0.04%:  I've taken
0.04%:  I wrote all these
0.04%:  that makes me wonder what
0.04%:  it's still a good
0.04%:  I'm done
0.07%:  I'm done with
0.04%:  his work was in the
0.04%:  his kids are the
0.04%:  made him that
0.04%:  I think it's weird that we
0.04%:  I think he made some
0.04%:  when I read the
0.04%:  he's still alive and he gets
0.06%:  he's still alive and he gets credit
0.04%:  it's a little weird how I've made
0.04%:  those words
0.04%:  he also wrote
0.04%:  I've said that twice
0.04%:  I think there's a movie
0.05%:  I think there's a movie called
0.04%:  that seems like a weird thing to call
0.04%:  when we
0.04%:  what was
0.04%:  he doesn't like cheese
0.04%:  the award
0.04%:  he's like 
0.04%:  he works in
0.04%:  I'd like to change the
0.04%:  in ret
0.04%:  it covers
0.04%:  I think his degree
0.09%:  I think his degree was
0.04%:  that work
0.04%:  who am
0.04%:  he's alive still
0.04%:  so
0.04%:  that's a little weird when I
0.04%:  it's more like he co
0.04%:  he never said he
0.09%:  he never said he liked it
0.07%:  he never said he likes
0.04%:  it's easier
0.04%:  this seems like a weird
0.04%:  he's still more
0.04%:  I think we'll leave it there
0.04%:  it's like the world's second
0.04%:  I'd like to see what he writes
0.04%:  he's still alive; he wrote it
0.04%:  he's great
0.04%:  it's more like he was called
0.04%:  wait this doesn
0.89%:  wait this doesn't work
0.50%:  wait this doesn't make
0.16%:  wait this doesn't work well
0.09%:  wait this doesn't work well with
0.09%:  wait this doesn't work with
0.06%:  wait this doesn't rh
0.05%:  wait this doesn't work well as
0.04%:  this is still
0.04%:  he might've come
0.04%:  it's more like dad
0.04%:  the term was
0.04%:  this isn't real
0.04%:  let's talk
0.04%:  what he did is called
0.04%:  while we're at it I've added
0.04%:  that's kinda the worst
0.04%:  this is now the world we'll
0.04%:  it made his
0.04%:  he's still alive and works with
0.04%:  it's this thing
0.18%:  it's this thing called
0.04%:  I've gone
0.04%:  he'd never said
0.04%:  the whole idea
0.04%:  I think we've all wasted
0.04%:  all I did was write down the
0.04%:  there's all kinds
0.04%:  while we're at it might as well add
0.04%:  he's still alive and was
0.04%:  it's kinda weird how I
0.04%:  we've all agreed that the
0.04%:  this makes things
0.05%:  this makes things worse
0.04%:  I think we'll go ahead
0.04%:  he writes his
0.04%:  it's all made
0.04%:  it's all I've read since
0.04%:  it's making it
0.08%:  it's making it hard
0.04%:  it's like his second
0.04%:  he did some work
0.04%:  that's all he
0.15%:  that's all he did
0.08%:  that's all he's ever
0.04%:  we're still asking him
0.04%:  he did some work with
0.04%:  which one
0.04%:  while we're at it I'd also
0.04%:  that's where I was
0.04%:  we've called it the
0.04%:  he's still alive and I'd
0.04%:  it doesn't work as well with him
0.04%:  it was him who came
0.04%:  it's never come
0.04%:  it's the more
0.04%:  I've done this
0.04%:  I think he's dead;
0.04%:  it was when
0.04%:  I'm the one who made
0.04%:  it's the world we lived in last week; the
0.04%:  I'm sick
0.04%:  this whole idea was
0.04%:  it's all I ever
0.04%:  all he did was write down the two
0.04%:  it's all this
0.04%:  it's like the 
0.04%:  I've now
0.04%:  it seems he
0.04%:  there's a video game called '
0.04%:  wait I mess
0.04%:  that last line was
0.04%:  it's making this
0.04%:  this is where it
0.04%:  his work has led
0.04%:  it's all I ever think
0.04%:  wait the
0.04%:  while we're at it I've also
0.04%:  I lied the
0.08%:  I lied the whole
0.04%:  he'd like
0.04%:  what he did was ask
0.04%:  he doesn't make
0.04%:  that's kinda weird!!
0.04%:  it's more like I've made
0.04%:  don
0.14%:  don't read
0.04%:  the whole world'
0.04%:  I think it's right
0.04%:  I made him a
0.04%:  this isn't how
0.04%:  I was making some
0.04%:  that's the least
0.04%:  I'm scared
0.04%:  I might've mis
0.04%:  we've had this wrong
0.04%:  that's their
0.05%:  that's their middle
0.04%:  all he did was give it the
0.04%:  I think that's a lie
0.04%:  all that
0.12%:  all that's wrong
0.04%:  it was while
0.04%:  all I've got here
0.05%:  all I've got here is this
0.04%:  all I've got here is the
0.04%:  it's the second there
0.04%:  while we're at it we might as well ded
0.04%:  I think this is more
0.04%:  wait this is wrong
0.04%:  it's never called
0.04%:  he doesn't have credit
0.04%:  I've made that all
0.04%:  I wrote his thesis
0.04%:  it's him who gets
0.08%:  it's him who gets credit
0.04%:  I see
0.04%:  it's the same thing twice
0.04%:  it's the later
0.04%:  it's a little less
0.04%:  I've made things
0.05%:  I've made things worse
0.04%:  like
0.04%:  I think we'd all agree this
0.04%:  it's made him the sole
0.04%:  that last line makes me
0.04%:  that doesn't work as well with me
0.04%:  wait that's wrong he
0.04%:  now that I've said the
0.14%:  now that I've said the words
0.08%:  now that I've said the word
0.04%:  this was more like
0.04%:  all that's wrong with
0.04%:  while we're at it I'd also like to ded
0.04%:  that's weird;
0.04%:  it doesn't make him that;
0.04%:  this does
0.05%:  this does make
0.04%:  it's not like
0.04%:  he wrote down
0.04%:  he wrote down his
0.04%:  wait I'm wrong
0.04%:  this is the second
0.04%:  while we're at it I might as well come
0.04%:  I call
0.04%:  I got the
0.04%:  it's kinda hard to tell who
0.04%:  that's how it'
0.04%:  there's still time
0.04%:  that's the worst ac
0.04%:  it's weird how well
0.04%:  I think we might've missed a
0.07%:  I think we might've missed a word
0.04%:  I wrote those
0.04%:  all I did was change the words like
0.04%:  there's a whole movie
0.04%:  what did he call
0.04%:  he died like seven
0.04%:  I'm making these all
0.04%:  the last line there
0.07%:  the last line there was added
0.04%:  he's still alive right now!!
0.04%:  I'm making that word
0.04%:  it's listed
0.04%:  it's making this whole
0.04%:  that doesn't work as well as it
0.08%:  that doesn't work as well as it did
0.04%:  it makes me wonder which
0.04%:  it's given him like
0.04%:  I had to write
0.04%:  I messed it
0.04%:  we'll give
0.37%:  we'll give him the award
0.07%:  we'll give him the latter
0.06%:  we'll give him the credit
0.05%:  we'll give him the award in
0.05%:  we'll give him the title
0.04%:  we'll give him the second
0.04%:  it gives
0.06%:  it gives him
0.06%:  it gives him credit
0.04%:  it gives him the
0.04%:  he's still kinda
0.04%:  it was some
0.04%:  I've read like two
0.04%:  I don't like it
0.04%:  it worked
0.04%:  this whole time we've all
0.04%:  this doesn't work as well with me
0.04%:  it was more like he was
0.04%:  it's the latter one
0.04%:  he's got like 
0.04%:  we're making this all
0.04%:  that last line'
0.04%:  all he did was design
0.04%:  that line makes
0.04%:  no he's like
0.04%:  this is the worst song
0.04%:  the middle
0.04%:  wait these
0.04%:  it's making him a doctor
0.04%:  that seems kinda
0.14%:  that seems kinda weird
0.04%:  I've heard the
0.04%:  what I did there was mess
0.04%:  the world we live in makes me sad
0.04%:  he's still alive; he's got
0.04%:  it's all he ever
0.04%:  I can't see how
0.04%:  I'd give
0.04%:  I had the wrong
0.04%:  it makes him the single
0.04%:  that last word
0.04%:  it's more like he said
0.04%:  I wrote the whole
0.04%:  while we're at it we might as well set
0.04%:  it's more like how he'
0.04%:  it's kinda sweet
0.10%:  it's kinda sweet how
0.05%:  it's kinda sweet how he'
0.05%:  it's kinda sweet how he's called
0.04%:  that's what it's called now
0.04%:  his mother
0.04%:  it made him the god
0.04%:  this is what I'd
0.05%:  this is what I'd like
0.04%:  all he did was wonder
0.04%:  I think that's it
0.04%:  right now I'm still
0.04%:  it's more that he likes
0.04%:  it's like the worst thing I've made
0.04%:  he's more like its
0.04%:  I don't see how we'll
0.12%:  I don't see how we'll ever get
0.08%:  I don't see how we'll ever get this
0.04%:  we have a
0.04%:  this gives me the
0.04%:  I made a
0.04%:  this is the world we lived in last week; I'd
0.04%:  wait I think he
0.11%:  wait I think he's dead
0.06%:  wait I think he's more
0.04%:  I have a
0.04%:  this is all the work
0.04%:  I think we've all agreed that we
0.06%:  I think we've all agreed that we'd
0.04%:  we called the
0.04%:  he's more a god
0.04%:  the world we live in is we
0.04%:  what I'd
0.11%:  what I'd like is
0.08%:  what I'd like to hear
0.06%:  what I'd like to see
0.05%:  what I'd like is some
0.04%:  what I'd like to do
0.04%:  this makes me wish I was
0.04%:  what I've done here is made
0.04%:  what I said there makes
0.04%:  I think it's great
0.04%:  he later
0.04%:  I kinda messed it
0.04%:  that's wrong; his
0.04%:  I think he's legit
0.04%:  I might've added those
0.04%:  I kinda made it
0.04%:  it's kinda weird how well
0.04%:  his work was done
0.04%:  I heard he likes
0.04%:  it's me who's making
0.05%:  it's me who's making that
0.04%:  what it did was give me
0.04%:  this is like the most
0.04%:  this all comes
0.04%:  we're all kind
0.04%:  I've made a
0.04%:  his degree
0.04%:  this is all I've got here
0.04%:  his kids named
0.04%:  he's kinda dead
0.04%:  I think it's hard to decide
0.04%:  the third
0.04%:  I think we'd call
0.06%:  I think we'd call him
0.04%:  there's not a whole
0.04%:  I'd still like the
0.09%:  I'd still like the answer
0.04%:  he's more like the second
0.04%:  I've made some things
0.04%:  I'm making the latter
0.04%:  I think we've lost him
0.04%:  it's more like that second
0.04%:  he died a while
0.04%:  it doesn't have the
0.14%:  it doesn't have the word
0.07%:  it doesn't have the word '
0.04%:  what I've said here makes little
0.04%:  it's when he was
0.04%:  he's not the
0.04%:  I think there's a lot
0.04%:  what I did there was kind
0.04%:  I don't get what
0.04%:  this whole idea came
0.04%:  that's weird how
0.04%:  it's also made
0.06%:  it's also made him the
0.04%:  he's still alive and did
0.04%:  I'd like to have this
0.04%:  these last two lines were added while
0.04%:  I've heard it called the
0.04%:  it comes
0.04%:  it's still math
0.04%:  he did write the
0.04%:  he's coming
0.04%:  it's a cover
0.04%:  we got
0.04%:  it's like the worst ac
0.04%:  it's a little weird how he's talked
0.04%:  that's the worst idea
0.04%:  I don't like the
0.04%:  it's weird that we have
0.04%:  we're in
0.04%:  it's a new
0.04%:  I think we've made it
0.04%:  I think we've made it worse
0.04%:  it's making me wish we
0.04%:  that's wrong; it
0.06%:  that's wrong; it's called
0.06%:  that's wrong; it's called the
0.05%:  that's wrong; it's like
0.04%:  we've come
0.04%:  it's still a sem
0.04%:  this seems like a good
0.04%:  that's made him like
0.04%:  it's more like a child'
0.08%:  it's more like a child's game
0.04%:  it made him the 
0.04%:  I'd still like to see him
0.04%:  I think he's still active
0.04%:  we're still at
0.04%:  we've got like
0.04%:  he's never asked me what
0.04%:  we'll have to come
0.04%:  what he wrote is
0.04%:  I like it when he
0.04%:  I like it when he writes
0.04%:  all he did was ask
0.04%:  that's all we're
0.07%:  that's all we're doing
0.04%:  what he was
0.04%:  we might need
0.04%:  I think it might've come
0.04%:  I'd love to see
0.04%:  it's the world we'd
0.04%:  it's more called the
0.04%:  he doesn't call
0.04%:  the whole sem
0.04%:  that gives me some
0.04%:  this is the world we'd like
0.04%:  I wrote this while eating
0.04%:  it was me who wrote it
0.04%:  I think it's more his sem
0.04%:  it's more like he gave it
0.04%:  I lied there'
0.04%:  this is making me wish we'
0.04%:  I added the last line there
0.04%:  I had him
0.04%:  while we're at it I'd also like to give
0.04%:  which is more
0.04%:  while we're at it I might as well make
0.04%:  the thing is
0.05%:  the thing is called
0.04%:  he never did like
0.04%:  he's still alive so it
0.19%:  he's still alive so it's weird
0.08%:  he's still alive so it's more
0.04%:  he's still alive so it's weird to
0.04%:  don't read this
0.04%:  I think he'd get
0.04%:  I think the word is '
0.04%:  those rh
0.04%:  it was made
0.04%:  I might've messed this
0.04%:  this song is like
0.04%:  he's still alive and we're good
0.04%:  I think we all agree that'
0.04%:  I don't care who
0.04%:  I don't care who likes what
0.04%:  it was his other
0.04%:  I love
0.04%:  all the words
0.04%:  it's more like he'll
0.04%:  he doesn't seem like he
0.04%:  I think that's a crime
0.04%:  I'll admit it'
0.04%:  we all agree that's the
0.04%:  in this world we
0.04%:  there's a long
0.04%:  wait I'm making this whole
0.04%:  he did a
0.04%:  this is kinda weird
0.04%:  that's kinda clever
0.04%:  it's all we ever
0.04%:  this was me
0.04%:  I think that's called '
0.04%:  it's the world's oldest
0.04%:  this is what we call
0.04%:  I did that while
0.04%:  that's the world we lived in two
0.72%:  that's the world we lived in two weeks
0.04%:  it's made him a legend
0.04%:  that's a weird image
0.04%:  he's the second
0.04%:  I might have dream
0.04%:  things are
0.04%:  what I've done there
0.04%:  we'll give the
0.07%:  we'll give the award
0.11%:  we'll give the award to the
0.04%:  we all agree this
0.04%:  this is less
0.04%:  that's like eight
0.07%:  that's like eight words
0.04%:  that's all I've got so
0.04%:  he's real good
0.04%:  his work has given
0.04%:  he's a living
0.04%:  wait there's a whole
0.04%:  this seems kinda
0.04%:  I might have missed a word in
0.04%:  that's what I'd
0.15%:  that's what I'd like
0.04%:  I think it made him a
0.04%:  it's more like a single
0.04%:  I think he's more dad
0.04%:  I think we'd all agree with
0.04%:  it's more like he was the dad
0.04%:  it's even
0.08%:  it's even worse
0.04%:  I'm taking
0.04%:  it was more like '
0.04%:  it's more like him having
0.04%:  this is where I was
0.04%:  make
0.04%:  I might've kinda
0.04%:  we're still in
0.04%:  what he did was make some
0.04%:  it's still hard to solve
0.04%:  I worked
0.04%:  I wrote this last
0.07%:  I wrote this last week
0.04%:  I wrote this last week while
0.04%:  his work in the
0.04%:  we made him
0.04%:  he's still alive and he's great
0.04%:  I think he is
0.04%:  I made the rest
0.04%:  it's his mother
0.04%:  I think he's great
0.04%:  I've read that
0.04%:  he gets his
0.04%:  it's made his
0.04%:  he doesn't give a shit
0.04%:  I don't see how this will
0.06%:  I don't see how this will ever
0.04%:  it's more like his dad'
0.04%:  it was called more
0.04%:  it's all he's ever wanted
0.04%:  it's the world we lived in last week I was
0.04%:  it makes me wish
0.05%:  it makes me wish I'd never
0.04%:  that's the worst idea I've come
0.04%:  that's him in
0.04%:  the last line there is
0.04%:  it might'
0.04%:  I'm not real
0.04%:  this is how I'
0.04%:  I'm tired
0.04%:  he's lived
0.04%:  his title
0.04%:  it's more a sem
0.04%:  it's me who's a
0.04%:  it's still kinda weird
0.04%:  this whole time I was mis
0.04%:  this is where I'll
0.04%:  that's like a whole
0.04%:  this has made me kind
0.04%:  it's a well
0.04%:  it was called more like
0.04%:  he's alive and worked
0.04%:  he's talked
0.04%:  all he did was talk
0.04%:  it's called things like the
0.04%:  wait where
0.06%:  wait where did
0.10%:  wait where did I get this
0.04%:  wait where did I get the
0.04%:  I lied he

0.04%:  that's making the
0.04%:  what made
0.04%:  this work
0.05%:  this work was
0.04%:  I've no idea what his work
0.04%:  he doesn't like that
0.04%:  it's given him a whole
0.04%:  that's more like how
0.04%:  it's hard to give him
0.04%:  his work came
0.04%:  what he asked
0.04%:  wait we
0.06%:  wait we're still
0.04%:  wait there's like a
0.04%:  these last two lines were made

0.04%:  this doesn't seem like the world I'
0.11%:  this doesn't seem like the world I'd live
0.04%:  while we're doing this I'd
0.04%:  while we're at it let's also give him
0.04%:  wait he's still alive right
0.04%:  that's wrong; he died
0.04%:  he's more like the mid
0.04%:  we don't like him
0.04%:  that was more like the
0.04%:  this makes me wish I'd never said
0.04%:  it was like 
0.04%:  this is where I admit
0.04%:  I have it
0.04%:  it was called the sem
0.04%:  we don't have the time
0.04%:  that's wrong; it's the
0.04%:  there's still like two
0.04%:  it's making me wish that
0.04%:  it's weird how he's called

0.04%:  I'd like to see this movie
0.04%:  I made his whole
0.04%:  I stole
0.04%:  that's wrong; the
0.04%:  while the
0.04%:  this is what I get
0.04%:  I don't have time to write
0.04%:  I don't like the word
0.04%:  that was a weird

0.04%:  it's more like he's having
0.04%:  he was wrong
0.04%:  that's the world we live in!!
0.04%:  I've read it twice
0.04%:  it's more like he's the one
0.04%:  it's kinda weird how he got
0.04%:  it's how
0.04%:  it's how he came
0.04%:  let's change the
0.04%:  I lied; he's the
0.04%:  I'm kinda glad we live

0.04%:  we have to call
0.04%:  we have to call him
0.04%:  he's a math
0.04%:  it was his doctor
0.04%:  it's that whole
0.04%:  when did
0.04%:  I've no idea how well
0.04%:  the word I'
0.04%:  this got
0.12%:  this got weird
0.04%:  I've called
0.04%:  when he said
0.04%:  I'm having this
0.04%:  I think he drew
0.04%:  I like his
0.04%:  I was making those
0.04%:  it's making a
0.04%:  it's more like a dad who
0.04%:  her
0.04%:  it's kinda weird how close
0.04%:  I'm not clear
0.04%:  he's sort
0.04%:  wait that's wrong I
0.04%:  wait that's wrong I'
0.04%:  it was his work with
0.04%:  I've made him those
0.04%:  I'd like it
0.04%:  let's leave
0.04%:  it's more like he added the
0.04%:  it's kinda weird he
0.18%:  it's kinda weird he's called
0.20%:  it's kinda weird he's called that
0.04%:  we don't give
0.05%:  we don't give awards
0.04%:  I've added the last line there
0.04%:  all I've done is screw
0.04%:  while we're at it I might as well do
0.04%:  while we're at it I've added some
0.04%:  he talked
0.04%:  I gave
0.04%:  I think we've st
0.04%:  I'm kinda glad it
0.05%:  I'm kinda glad it's solved
0.04%:  I'm kinda glad it's over
0.04%:  wait this makes me
0.04%:  it's kinda weird that I
0.07%:  it's kinda weird that I've
0.05%:  it's kinda weird that I'm the
0.04%:  it's more this
0.04%:  I think he wrote a
0.04%:  he wanted
0.04%:  on
0.04%:  he's dead;
0.04%:  he did his
0.04%:  that's wrong; he's still
0.04%:  we've all agreed it
0.04%:  I made that last line
0.04%:  it's clear he's the
0.04%:  he doesn't have like
0.04%:  this isn't a great
0.04%:  we've made him that twice
0.04%:  the two things
0.04%:  I wrote this song like
0.04%:  I'm kinda glad the
0.04%:  it's kinda weird that we've all
0.04%:  it's me who's making this
0.04%:  he was given this
0.04%:  he hated it
0.04%:  this was kind
0.04%:  it's making him the world
0.05%:  it's making him the world's oldest
0.04%:  that's a lie; he wrote
0.04%:  what I'd like right
0.85%:  what I'd like right now is some
0.09%:  what I'd like right now is some sweet
0.04%:  that's a whole
0.04%:  it doesn't work well as a lim
0.04%:  that's che
0.04%:  wait a
0.07%:  wait a sec
0.04%:  I'm still a
0.04%:  the world we live in makes me wish
0.04%:  while we're at it we might as well add some
0.04%:  we all agreed
0.04%:  it's making me sad to
0.04%:  this is not
0.04%:  it's not clear how he
0.04%:  I'd heard that
0.04%:  all I did was write down some
0.04%:  it is called the
0.04%:  even I'
0.04%:  I knew
0.04%:  it's more like I was
0.04%:  we added
0.04%:  he has like
0.04%:  I might like
0.04%:  I made all those things
0.04%:  that's his degree
0.04%:  that's wrong I
0.04%:  it's still a good read
0.04%:  the world is still
0.04%:  that's all I got
0.04%:  I kinda wish it
0.04%:  it's more like he wasn
0.04%:  it's me who's made that
0.04%:  he's never said he
0.09%:  he's never said he likes it
0.05%:  he's never said he liked
0.04%:  the latter was added
0.04%:  there's like a whole class
0.04%:  he worked at
0.04%:  this is great
0.04%:  what I'd like to do is write
0.04%:  it's not clear who's the
0.04%:  it's making me a little sad how
0.04%:  this whole met
0.04%:  what he did is more like
0.04%:  while we're at it I might as well ded
0.04%:  it's like seven
0.04%:  I've made him that second
0.04%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I had
0.04%:  what I'm doing is review
0.04%:  it's a little weird having
0.04%:  it was me who did the sem
0.04%:  it's like the worst movie
0.04%:  we call him the '
0.04%:  that's what I call
0.04%:  in his
0.04%:  that's a good
0.04%:  now that I've said it'
0.04%:  I think we've heard
0.04%:  it's more like '
0.04%:  I'm making it worse
0.04%:  what he's most
0.04%:  it's still a great
0.04%:  there's too
0.04%:  I might have kinda
0.04%:  this was made
0.04%:  I'd read the
0.04%:  what I'm doing with
0.04%:  I'd like this
0.04%:  w
0.06%:  wow that
0.05%:  wow this
0.04%:  I might've added that last line
0.04%:  I write these
0.04%:  I write these things
0.04%:  while this
0.04%:  no I'm k
0.04%:  he was given that
0.04%:  that's all I've said
0.04%:  I can't read this
0.04%:  he's a little weird
0.04%:  I might have m
0.04%:  it's a thesis
0.04%:  it's all the same words
0.04%:  I might've said
0.04%:  I'm making all the
0.08%:  I'm making all the words
0.04%:  this tim
0.04%:  it's still named
0.04%:  there's two sem
0.04%:  it's more like he's come
0.04%:  I think it's his middle
0.04%:  that made it worse!!
0.04%:  I don't see him
0.04%:  the song
0.04%:  it was the second
0.04%:  there's still like a decade
0.04%:  that's hard
0.04%:  the world we live in was the
0.04%:  I'll leave it there
0.04%:  we call him other
0.04%:  that's the worst line
0.04%:  the second'
0.04%:  I liked his
0.04%:  he's dead now so
0.04%:  this is the world we lived in last week; we
0.04%:  that's where I got it
0.04%:  it's got like
0.04%:  that did
0.04%:  while we're at it let's add the
0.04%:  I might've messed that one
0.04%:  it might've made
0.04%:  I wonder
0.04%:  I wonder what
0.04%:  that's his sem
0.04%:  he's still alive so that's weird!!
0.04%:  it's kinda weird he's called the
0.04%:  it's hard to even
0.04%:  what I did there was lie
0.04%:  it's still making
0.04%:  this whole talk is
0.04%:  it's what he worked
0.04%:  that's all there
0.04%:  I'm mis
0.04%:  I'd still like a
0.04%:  I want
0.04%:  that'd make him a
0.04%:  it's all over
0.04%:  he won'
0.04%:  he won't like
0.04%:  wait there's like eight
0.04%:  it's kinda weird that he gets
0.27%:  it's kinda weird that he gets called
0.04%:  I think he's god
0.04%:  this is where I lose
0.04%:  this is like the weird
0.04%:  there's one
0.04%:  makes
0.06%:  makes him
0.04%:  that makes it worse
0.04%:  it'll take
0.04%:  this is making less
0.04%:  that's a lie!!
0.04%:  there's this video game I made
0.04%:  it's called this
0.04%:  while that
0.04%:  it doesn't work as a lim
0.04%:  what it's made him is called
0.04%:  I've said it
0.04%:  it's gender
0.04%:  this isn't what
0.04%:  I'd like to see where that
0.04%:  this song makes
0.04%:  we still know
0.04%:  that's made him a
0.04%:  that made me write
0.04%:  that's in
0.04%:  he worked on this
0.04%:  what I've said there is like
0.04%:  he liked the
0.04%:  while we're at it we might as well send
0.04%:  this is where I end
0.04%:  he never said it
0.04%:  that seems wrong
0.04%:  he's god
0.04%:  we think his
0.04%:  that's a crime
0.04%:  let's change it
0.03%:  that'd make more
0.04%:  that'd make more sense with
0.03%:  I'd heard this
0.03%:  wait I've made
0.03%:  wait I have
0.03%:  we've got a whole
0.03%:  there's like a second
0.03%:  it makes me wish I'd gone
0.03%:  where was
0.03%:  that's where I've
0.03%:  I think it's clear we
0.03%:  that makes him two
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how he's got
0.03%:  I've no idea what he's called
0.03%:  we still have to write
0.03%:  I think it's '
0.03%:  I've made him that twice
0.03%:  it's in the middle
0.03%:  the nick
0.03%:  what he was doing
0.03%:  I'm doing the
0.03%:  he's still alive and gets
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how this came
0.03%:  that made it worse;
0.03%:  we're doing it
0.03%:  it's kinda the same
0.03%:  we like
0.03%:  don't read his
0.03%:  I'm making these last
0.03%:  it's nice
0.03%:  that's making it seem
0.03%:  we're in the
0.22%:  we're in the middle
0.03%:  I think we've had
0.03%:  this did
0.03%:  I think this is worse
0.03%:  he's still alive; he died
0.03%:  he's still alive and worked with me twice
0.03%:  there's this new
0.03%:  he died this week and
0.03%:  that's not how
0.03%:  there's like two d
0.03%:  I write this down
0.03%:  that's wrong; I
0.03%:  I wrote this down while we
0.03%:  those were all
0.03%:  he's still alive and we were
0.03%:  he was more like the middle
0.03%:  I messed with
0.03%:  it's the single
0.03%:  that doesn't work well at
0.03%:  I kinda wish he'd solved
0.03%:  I'll admit this is the
0.03%:  that's like his middle
0.03%:  I've made these
0.06%:  I've made these things
0.03%:  it's making him this
0.03%:  I know what
0.03%:  I'm still kinda scared
0.03%:  I made him this
0.03%:  what he's doing
0.03%:  it's since
0.03%:  this is all coming
0.03%:  it did make him a
0.03%:  wait where did this
0.05%:  wait where did this song
0.03%:  wait I think he's still
0.03%:  it rh
0.03%:  I might've read
0.03%:  we wrote
0.04%:  we wrote this
0.03%:  he's still alive and we'd
0.03%:  I said that wrong
0.03%:  I call him the
0.03%:  I'll give
0.04%:  I'll give him
0.12%:  I'll give him credit
0.04%:  I'll give him the
0.12%:  I'll give him the credit
0.03%:  it's so hard
0.03%:  it's his work that's given
0.03%:  this might make it
0.03%:  it's like this weird
0.03%:  I'd read his
0.03%:  I don't see how this will make
0.03%:  his last
0.03%:  it's more that he was like
0.03%:  that's the world we lived in last week so
0.03%:  this kind
0.03%:  he's still alive; he got
0.03%:  he's still a dick
0.03%:  I'd like to add
0.03%:  no it's called the
0.03%:  wait that's the weird
0.03%:  it's hard to tell who's made
0.03%:  it's all kinds
0.03%:  that's still the world
0.04%:  that's still the world we'
0.03%:  math
0.03%:  the world we live in is awesome
0.03%:  it's weird to think
0.03%:  wait this is making
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how he's listed
0.03%:  I don't see how he'd
0.03%:  his work isn
0.03%:  that's how I'
0.07%:  that's how I'd like
0.03%:  we don't call him that; we'
0.03%:  he asked the
0.03%:  he's still alive so I might'
0.03%:  I don't recall the
0.03%:  it's weird that we've
0.03%:  it's still me
0.03%:  it's his second
0.03%:  all he did was give me the
0.03%:  it's making me lose
0.03%:  it's called some
0.07%:  it's called some other things
0.03%:  it's more like he called
0.03%:  I think he's more god
0.03%:  I did the whole
0.03%:  I wrote down
0.03%:  the world we live in is that I
0.03%:  it's more like he had some
0.03%:  it's when he wrote
0.03%:  here is
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I made
0.03%:  I might have made it worse
0.03%:  we call him things
0.03%:  that work is
0.03%:  it's him who made
0.03%:  we don't call him that!!
0.03%:  it's me who thinks
0.03%:  that's where it ends
0.03%:  all he did was create
0.03%:  I think the last
0.03%:  wait that's wrong he's like
0.03%:  he's got like a
0.03%:  this whole time I've mis
0.03%:  it's what the
0.03%:  those last
0.14%:  those last two lines were
0.33%:  those last two lines were added
0.03%:  here's some
0.06%:  here's some advice
0.03%:  we have like
0.03%:  I've talked
0.03%:  he'll never get
0.03%:  this is where I've lost
0.03%:  this is awesome
0.03%:  it's a real sem
0.03%:  that made it worse didn
0.03%:  this whole talk was
0.03%:  I don't recall his
0.03%:  it's more like he's the dad and
0.03%:  I've made that last
0.03%:  it's the worst thing I've said
0.60%:  it's the worst thing I've said all week
0.04%:  it's the worst thing I've said all week!!
0.03%:  it's me who gets the
0.03%:  he's still alive; I made
0.03%:  I don't see how we're still alive with
0.03%:  this seems like the
0.03%:  there's video
0.05%:  there's video games called
0.05%:  there's video games with
0.03%:  I kinda wish the
0.03%:  it's making me wish we'd solved
0.05%:  it's making me wish we'd solved this
0.04%:  it's making me wish we'd solved the real
0.03%:  this isn't where
0.03%:  I wrote this while we talked
0.03%:  he's dead so it
0.07%:  he's dead so it's weird
0.06%:  he's dead so it's more
0.05%:  he's dead so it's weird that
0.04%:  he's dead so it's more like he
0.03%:  I still kinda
0.03%:  he died this week so
0.03%:  we still have a
0.03%:  we have the
0.03%:  what he's more
0.03%:  this gets
0.03%:  there's two things
0.03%:  it's a little weird he
0.03%:  these two things were
0.03%:  what he's done
0.03%:  it's more like he's well
0.03%:  I think it's more well
0.03%:  what I said there was g
0.03%:  what it's done is make him well
0.03%:  this was the world
0.03%:  this was the world we lived in like
0.03%:  it's named more
0.06%:  it's named more like
0.03%:  he's still alive with
0.03%:  it's more like the 
0.03%:  he's still a living
0.03%:  it's more like he was a child
0.03%:  that's a lie he
0.03%:  that's a lie he'
0.03%:  that's the last
0.03%:  it's given rise
0.03%:  while we're at it let's solve
0.03%:  he named his
0.03%:  he's dead so it's more like his
0.03%:  it's weird that I know so
0.03%:  this is the s
0.03%:  it's more like his name
0.03%:  I don't like this world we've made;
0.03%:  I think we were all
0.03%:  what's this
0.03%:  this seems kinda weird
0.03%:  we'll give him the second award
0.03%:  that's kinda weird;
0.03%:  I'm making shit
0.03%:  it's more like a middle child who'
0.03%:  his ideas
0.07%:  his ideas were
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I'd
0.03%:  that's the same
0.03%:  I lied; he's still
0.03%:  his title was more
0.03%:  it was hard
0.03%:  it's here
0.03%:  I'd heard he
0.03%:  the thesis
0.03%:  I've got his
0.03%:  he's still alive I think!!
0.03%:  what I'm doing here is a
0.03%:  that's a lie; he didn
0.03%:  I don't see how that
0.03%:  I'd like to direct
0.03%:  that's not where we
0.05%:  that's not where we live
0.03%:  it made him what'
0.03%:  it's hard to decide what's making
0.03%:  it's the world we've all
0.03%:  this song's called
0.03%:  those two
0.03%:  that made him like
0.03%:  I made the words
0.03%:  he doesn't like the word '
0.03%:  I lied and made
0.03%:  his work was sem
0.03%:  it's right down
0.03%:  when he did
0.03%:  I've had that
0.03%:  all he did was give me this
0.03%:  we call him '
0.03%:  that's what I've got
0.03%:  I'd like to change this
0.03%:  I think it's the world
0.41%:  I think it's the world we live
0.05%:  I think it's the world we'
0.03%:  it's all his
0.04%:  it's all his work
0.03%:  I don't get this
0.03%:  this is making me wish we'd solved
0.03%:  it's more like eight
0.03%:  I had to change
0.03%:  there's a list
0.03%:  wait we're still living
0.03%:  I know he
0.03%:  what I think we
0.03%:  it has made him like
0.03%:  that's where it came
0.03%:  this has given
0.03%:  it said
0.03%:  while we're at it we might as well end
0.03%:  this is hard
0.03%:  that weird
0.03%:  it was more like the mid
0.03%:  it had
0.03%:  he's done
0.03%:  I'd like to see that
0.03%:  it's more like the whole class
0.03%:  he's still like
0.03%:  I think it'll
0.03%:  it's the same thing!!
0.03%:  those were his
0.03%:  while we're at it let's get him
0.03%:  I've seen
0.03%:  that was me!!
0.03%:  I can't get over
0.07%:  I can't get over how well
0.07%:  I can't get over how well this
0.03%:  it still makes him the
0.03%:  that's what we called
0.03%:  let's make
0.03%:  I don't recall what
0.03%:  he died last week; his
0.03%:  I don't see how either
0.03%:  I'll admit that
0.04%:  I'll admit that'
0.03%:  since we
0.03%:  while we're at it let's give this
0.03%:  it's still the same word
0.03%:  what it's done is made me
0.03%:  this is the worst I've made
0.03%:  it reads
0.03%:  that might make it
0.04%:  that might make it worse
0.03%:  we don't have his
0.03%:  it's a shame
0.03%:  I don't care what he
0.34%:  I don't care what he likes
0.03%:  while he
0.03%:  it doesn't work as well with his
0.05%:  it doesn't work as well with his middle
0.03%:  this is the world we live in!!
0.03%:  he's like this
0.03%:  the world we live in is less
0.03%:  that's two
0.03%:  I've got more
0.03%:  while we're doing this let
0.05%:  while we're doing this let's make
0.05%:  while we're doing this let's talk
0.03%:  given
0.03%:  made him a
0.03%:  I've still got like
0.03%:  it's more like he was second
0.03%:  I think he's alive still
0.03%:  that doesn't work well with a
0.03%:  his dad
0.03%:  I've got no idea what he's called
0.03%:  I think he's a real
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in last week as
0.03%:  he's never liked it
0.03%:  wait where did I get that
0.03%:  he did like
0.03%:  it's hard to tell what came
0.03%:  that's all he's worked
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad this is where
0.03%:  he got his ideas
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how he's still
0.03%:  I have no idea how well
0.03%:  this gives me the cre
0.03%:  who cares what
0.03%:  while we're at it can
0.03%:  he said the
0.04%:  he said the word
0.03%:  it's hard to tell what's a
0.03%:  there's this video game I'
0.03%:  it did make him the
0.03%:  I think those
0.05%:  I think those were
0.03%:  it doesn't make his
0.03%:  it's the real
0.03%:  it's a direct
0.03%:  it's not clear how he likes
0.03%:  this is the world I'd
0.03%:  it does
0.03%:  this doesn't seem like the world we lived
0.03%:  let's get him
0.03%:  it doesn't make him his
0.03%:  this makes me wonder how
0.03%:  I think he's listed
0.03%:  it's awesome
0.03%:  I think he was more a
0.03%:  that made things
0.03%:  it's a review
0.03%:  he might've liked
0.03%:  this made his
0.03%:  we never call it
0.03%:  I'd still like him
0.03%:  there's a song
0.03%:  this is where we got
0.03%:  it's like the world's least
0.03%:  this doesn't make a
0.04%:  this doesn't make a whole
0.03%:  it's now the
0.05%:  it's now the world
0.22%:  it's now the world we lived
0.03%:  it's hard to decide what makes me
0.03%:  he's still alive and does
0.03%:  it's more like his dad was
0.03%:  that's a lie; I'
0.06%:  that's a lie; I'm making
0.03%:  that's a lie; I've
0.03%:  all I've done is re
0.03%:  this all might
0.03%:  he worked on the
0.03%:  it all
0.03%:  I'd still like to hear how
0.03%:  it's like one
0.03%:  I think we had
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in;
0.03%:  I don't get what'
0.03%:  what I'd like right now is some sweet sweet
0.03%:  I think we all agree this
0.03%:  it's more like we all
0.03%:  I think we mess
0.03%:  that's what I wrote
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how that'
0.03%:  this makes me wish I didn
0.03%:  it doesn't seem
0.24%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever
0.15%:  it doesn't seem like he was
0.11%:  it doesn't seem like he's had
0.10%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever said
0.09%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever said what
0.08%:  it doesn't seem like he was ever
0.06%:  it doesn't seem like he ever
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like he's all
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like he's made
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like he'd
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like he's that
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like he was called
0.03%:  it doesn't seem like he ever said
0.03%:  it doesn't seem like he's a
0.03%:  it doesn't seem like he'd have
0.03%:  it has given him more
0.03%:  the world was
0.03%:  I kinda wish he'd called
0.03%:  listen
0.03%:  this is what I've come
0.03%:  it's a little weird when we
0.03%:  I lied that'
0.03%:  it's like math
0.03%:  it's where he co
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad there
0.05%:  I'm kinda glad there's still
0.03%:  this is a real
0.03%:  what I wrote is
0.03%:  I saw this
0.03%:  he's like the dad
0.03%:  he's dead so it's more like the
0.03%:  that's where it all
0.03%:  that seems like it'd have
0.03%:  there's a slight mis
0.03%:  I think we might all
0.03%:  I might've made that one
0.03%:  it's hard to talk with
0.03%:  we've had that wrong
0.03%:  it was never
0.03%:  man I
0.03%:  I've added some things
0.03%:  it was me who made the
0.03%:  now that I've said it it
0.03%:  now that I've said it it's clear
0.03%:  what it did was get
0.03%:  he talks
0.03%:  wow that was
0.03%:  he made it while
0.03%:  that was made
0.03%:  this makes me wish I'd read
0.03%:  that's making this
0.03%:  that's kinda screw
0.03%:  he's still alive and it
0.03%:  this makes me a
0.03%:  I think it's weird that we've
0.03%:  what I've said here is kind
0.03%:  I don't see how that makes
0.03%:  it's called either
0.03%:  words
0.03%:  I'm wrong;
0.03%:  I'm making the words
0.03%:  he died three weeks
0.03%:  the kids
0.03%:  there's video games in
0.03%:  he's living

0.03%:  I think he still
0.03%:  his work isn't called
0.03%:  I think we called

0.03%:  I might've missed
0.03%:  I threw in
0.03%:  that's kinda sweet
0.03%:  it makes me want
0.03%:  I think he'll get
0.05%:  I think he'll get mad
0.03%:  wait I think he's called
0.03%:  he made some
0.03%:  it's like all
0.03%:  that doesn't seem
0.20%:  that doesn't seem right
0.06%:  that doesn't seem like
0.03%:  it's this one
0.04%:  it's this one right
0.03%:  it's weird how well this
0.03%:  the word he
0.03%:  what I did there was mis
0.03%:  he's still alive; it
0.03%:  he's still alive and work
0.03%:  I lied this
0.04%:  I lied this whole
0.03%:  that's all we've got so
0.03%:  I don't see how he's ever
0.03%:  I don't like how that came
0.03%:  it's hard to tell who likes
0.03%:  that's a direct
0.03%:  we don't call him that ever
0.03%:  the kids call
0.04%:  the kids call him
0.03%:  it's all he's talked
0.03%:  I wrote the w
0.03%:  it was more the
0.03%:  it's made him get
0.03%:  I'd never call it
0.03%:  I'd like to live
0.03%:  I wrote that with
0.03%:  what I did there was come
0.03%:  I've kinda screw
0.03%:  I've no idea what the word
0.03%:  he died like two months
0.03%:  what I've said there is kind
0.03%:  wait there's some
0.03%:  I think the term
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad this is where we live
0.03%:  it will
0.03%:  we've all agreed it's the
0.05%:  we've all agreed it's the second
0.03%:  while we're at it I think we've
0.03%:  this doesn't work well with sc
0.03%:  his name's right
0.03%:  that's wrong; I'
0.03%:  now that I've said it it seems
0.03%:  I heard it'
0.03%:  I've added this
0.03%:  I wrote most
0.03%:  those are like
0.03%:  his work was called the
0.03%:  all I've got here is his
0.03%:  it's the world we live in; I
0.03%:  that's all he worked
0.03%:  he's more like a child
0.03%:  all he did was write down this
0.03%:  it's more like I'm the
0.03%:  I might have to work
0.03%:  it's a nick
0.03%:  I think it's him
0.03%:  we're doing this whole
0.03%:  it's kinda made
0.07%:  it's kinda made him the
0.03%:  it's making me wish we were
0.04%:  it's making me wish we were still
0.03%:  he gets the
0.10%:  he gets the credit
0.03%:  his work's called
0.03%:  there's this woman
0.03%:  there's this woman called
0.03%:  that last line might
0.03%:  there isn't a sem
0.03%:  he claims
0.03%:  it's his dad
0.03%:  this is what we were
0.04%:  this is what we were doing

0.03%:  that's like a weird
0.04%:  that's like a weird thing
0.03%:  he's got his
0.03%:  I think he called it '
0.03%:  while we're at it we might as well make it
0.03%:  his given
0.03%:  I was doing
0.03%:  I think he was closer
0.03%:  he died like a
0.03%:  I think we missed the word
0.03%:  over
0.03%:  I'd like to see what he'
0.03%:  that's all I've got in
0.03%:  I wrote this all
0.03%:  I wrote this all down while
0.03%:  I think we've missed the real
0.03%:  he's still alive so that's kinda
0.26%:  he's still alive so that's kinda weird
0.03%:  it's his other sem
0.03%:  he is the
0.03%:  it doesn't seem like he's that well
0.03%:  I think it's called a
0.03%:  what I mean
0.03%:  I don't see how we'd ever
0.03%:  he was kinda
0.03%:  that's the name
0.03%:  these are called
0.03%:  it's weird how the two
0.03%:  we're all dead now
0.03%:  I'd like to hear the
0.03%:  this is one
0.03%:  this is making me wish I were
0.03%:  he called it '
0.03%:  more the
0.03%:  I wrote this while taking
0.03%:  we've all heard
0.03%:  all I've done here
0.03%:  now that I've read the
0.03%:  what it did was change
0.03%:  it's hard to tell what comes
0.03%:  all he did was write down what'
0.03%:  that's a lie; I made
0.03%:  his thesis was more like
0.03%:  I'm doing a
0.03%:  this weird
0.03%:  that's like three
0.03%:  what is
0.03%:  where's
0.03%:  this doesn't work as well as it
0.03%:  those last two lines were made
0.03%:  he might still
0.03%:  it's not clear how he'
0.03%:  he's there
0.03%:  all I've done is read
0.03%:  I might've missed a word in
0.03%:  we call his work the
0.03%:  when I write it like
0.03%:  it's weird that I'm making this
0.03%:  I meant
0.03%:  it's more like a second
0.03%:  I wrote him
0.03%:  we're having some
0.03%:  I think he did a
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad we still
0.04%:  I'm kinda glad we still have the
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in like 
0.03%:  this seems like it'd have
0.03%:  this is all I've worked
0.03%:  it's more like he and
0.03%:  we kinda
0.03%:  what it's made him is get
0.03%:  he's kinda still
0.03%:  there's math
0.03%:  he added
0.03%:  it'll make
0.03%:  it's a dis
0.03%:  that's like the second
0.03%:  I'll let
0.03%:  he's still alive; I was
0.03%:  that reads
0.08%:  that reads like
0.03%:  it's a weird name
0.03%:  what he did was more like give
0.03%:  it's all made him
0.03%:  it's making him rich
0.03%:  I think we've made the
0.03%:  there's this video game I made called
0.03%:  I think he's older
0.03%:  I might've made a
0.03%:  I've got no idea what he's like as
0.03%:  all he did was write down his
0.03%:  what it made
0.08%:  what it made him is
0.03%:  what it made him was like
0.03%:  all I know is he's the
0.03%:  now that I'm here
0.03%:  we're taking
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in last week; this
0.03%:  it gets
0.04%:  it gets worse when
0.03%:  he's like one
0.03%:  while we're at it we might as well invoke
0.03%:  it's not clear he
0.06%:  it's not clear he likes
0.04%:  it's not clear he liked
0.03%:  all I did was write these
0.03%:  there's this like

0.03%:  I'm seeing
0.03%:  there was like two
0.03%:  we're still kind
0.03%:  I did some
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how we got
0.03%:  there's whole
0.03%:  that's the worst nick

0.03%:  I think he said it'
0.03%:  I have to write
0.03%:  it's still the hard
0.03%:  there's a lot I
0.03%:  it's weird that he's called a
0.03%:  I think the word'

0.03%:  that's coming
0.03%:  it's all these
0.03%:  it's all these words
0.03%:  all I know is he wrote

0.03%:  that made him a
0.03%:  he was more like the dad
0.03%:  he did his work in
0.03%:  I think we've come

0.03%:  it's given him more like
0.03%:  I don't care what he liked

0.03%:  while we're at it we might as well move to
0.03%:  he was doing work

0.03%:  it doesn't work as well with a
0.03%:  I know he's dead

0.03%:  what we're doing is called
0.03%:  what we call
0.03%:  this made him a

0.03%:  it's hard to tell who came
0.03%:  he's still alive and came
0.03%:  it's not clear how well
0.03%:  it's still awesome
0.03%:  he's still alive and gets credit
0.03%:  his work isn't that

0.03%:  we've still got some
0.03%:  I've made these words
0.03%:  that's all I've heard
0.03%:  that was his sem
0.03%:  it's more like he did a
0.03%:  it's more like he named
0.03%:  it seems he'
0.03%:  all he did was draw
0.03%:  their lives
0.03%:  I wish he'd come
0.03%:  he's still alive and we worked
0.03%:  he'd like it

0.03%:  there's a single
0.03%:  we all know he's the
0.03%:  he's more like the second dad
0.03%:  it's this one here
0.03%:  the title's a
0.03%:  it made me
0.03%:  I think he's dece
0.03%:  that's all I've got in terms
0.03%:  I'd like to see him write
0.03%:  that's all we've got here
0.03%:  I might've kinda mess
0.03%:  it's more like the least
0.03%:  it's like the two
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how those
0.03%:  this was his sem
0.03%:  he's still alive and I made
0.03%:  the math is wrong
0.03%:  it's the second verse
0.03%:  we've had this wrong all
0.03%:  it's like that with
0.03%:  I wish he'd never asked
0.03%:  wow I
0.03%:  we gave him the second
0.03%:  it's still weird
0.03%:  it'll make him the
0.03%:  wow that's kinda
0.03%:  I think we called him
0.03%:  wait there's this
0.03%:  I kinda wish we still
0.07%:  I kinda wish we still lived
0.03%:  I think he's a little
0.03%:  it's not clear what he
0.06%:  it's not clear what he's like
0.05%:  it's not clear what he did
0.03%:  it seems like he didn
0.03%:  I'd love it
0.03%:  he's still alive and he's awesome
0.03%:  I kinda made the
0.03%:  I was the
0.03%:  I did that whole
0.03%:  I think it's clear he
0.03%:  I think we've missed a
0.03%:  it was wrong
0.03%:  I've said that wrong like 
0.03%:  he doesn't live
0.03%:  he did all
0.07%:  he did all this work
0.03%:  that makes me wish I'd gone
0.03%:  it's a little weird how we've made
0.03%:  I might make
0.03%:  it's not that
0.03%:  wait I lied
0.03%:  wait it's like
0.03%:  he doesn't like how
0.03%:  it's a doctor
0.03%:  what this
0.03%:  the most
0.03%:  I think he made a
0.03%:  I wrote that like
0.03%:  he doesn't claim
0.03%:  his middle name's like
0.03%:  two
0.03%:  I don't get what's so hard
0.03%:  I can't write the
0.03%:  I'd like to give him the
0.05%:  I'd like to give him the award
0.03%:  this is the world we lived in weeks
0.03%:  screw that
0.03%:  that's all we've talked
0.03%:  what I did was make
0.03%:  I'd like to give this award
0.03%:  it's hard to decide when
0.03%:  I went
0.03%:  the last verse
0.03%:  it's weird that I know all
0.03%:  it's weird that I know all these
0.03%:  I've read it like
0.07%:  I've read it like twice
0.03%:  this doesn't seem like the worst
0.03%:  it's more like he gave this
0.03%:  it doesn't have either
0.03%:  it's a thing he
0.03%:  it's a thing he did
0.03%:  he's still alive; the
0.03%:  it's a little weird how he's dead
0.03%:  it's hard to tell who is
0.03%:  that's the world we lived in like 
0.03%:  what it did was come
0.03%:  he wrote it down
0.03%:  it seems he was
0.03%:  what he did was kind
0.03%:  it was the 
0.03%:  this has given me some weird
0.03%:  while we're at it I think we'd
0.03%:  we've named
0.03%:  I don't see how we've
0.03%:  that's more like what I'
0.03%:  I think he's also
0.03%:  I've gotten
0.03%:  does
0.03%:  I might still like
0.03%:  this is the worst case
0.03%:  all I did there was switch some
0.03%:  I might want
0.03%:  don't ever
0.03%:  it takes
0.03%:  I might've added that line
0.03%:  it doesn't have a
0.03%:  it's more an
0.03%:  what I think we've
0.03%:  what's weird is the
0.03%:  what he did was derive some
0.03%:  he's awesome
0.03%:  that's kinda what
0.03%:  I've said this three
0.03%:  that's the world we'd like to live in; we
0.03%:  now that we've said it we
0.03%:  all his
0.06%:  all his work
0.03%:  I lied he didn
0.03%:  there's like a single
0.03%:  I've no idea what his middle
0.03%:  the word is '
0.03%:  he's died twice
0.03%:  it was like the worst
0.03%:  all he did was write the sem
0.03%:  this is making me a little sad
0.03%:  wait there's like seven
0.03%:  I'm making the last word
0.03%:  we're kinda still
0.03%:  there's all these
0.03%:  the last word'
0.03%:  we're still having this
0.03%:  it's more like a thing
0.03%:  we'll need
0.03%:  it's like seven words
0.03%:  in this world we live
0.03%:  I think we've all agreed the
0.03%:  it's me who's said
0.03%:  it kind
0.03%:  I'd like to give a
0.03%:  this comes
0.03%:  this word
0.03%:  he died last week at
0.03%:  wait where did that
0.07%:  wait where did that come
0.03%:  it's more like he's done
0.03%:  this is all I've got;
0.03%:  his work was the
0.03%:  I think he missed a
0.09%:  I think he missed a word
0.03%:  this is where I'm coming
0.03%:  it's solved
0.03%:  it's weird that the
0.03%:  it's these
0.03%:  wait that's like the weird
0.03%:  all he did was write down the sem
0.03%:  that's all I ever
0.03%:  this gives me an idea!!
0.03%:  that's where I came
0.03%:  he writes his own
0.03%:  he's still alive to
0.03%:  that makes me c
0.03%:  we don't give him
0.11%:  we don't give him credit
0.03%:  we'll give the award to him
0.03%:  it's still sem
0.03%:  these two ideas
0.03%:  I might've read this
0.03%:  that word is
0.03%:  I think we've all screw
0.03%:  it's made him well
0.03%:  it's making the world a
0.03%:  the world we live in makes this
0.03%:  this game
0.03%:  this gave
0.03%:  the second was
0.03%:  while we're at it we'
0.03%:  this is the world we lived in two
0.53%:  this is the world we lived in two weeks
0.03%:  I'll leave this
0.03%:  he did not
0.05%:  he did not write
0.03%:  I think we've all come
0.03%:  he has made
0.03%:  the second sem
0.03%:  he's still alive so it's weird that we
0.03%:  it's more like when I
0.03%:  it's more like when I was
0.03%:  that's less clever
0.03%:  he's kinda a
0.03%:  it made him a world
0.03%:  he h
0.03%:  it's like the worst thing I've come
0.03%:  I can't see him
0.03%:  this was never
0.03%:  that's where it ended
0.03%:  he's still alive; he works
0.03%:  what makes
0.03%:  it's the world we'd like
0.03%:  it's not clear what'
0.03%:  I kinda wish it were
0.03%:  this is now the world I
0.03%:  there's like an
0.03%:  I've made him a doctor
0.03%:  we don't call him that; we've
0.03%:  this is all wrong I
0.04%:  this is all wrong I'
0.03%:  this is all wrong I've
0.03%:  it goes
0.03%:  the last word was
0.03%:  we're kind
0.03%:  it's making me sort
0.03%:  what it's made him is dead wrong
0.03%:  I'd kind
0.03%:  he'll get
0.07%:  he'll get the award
0.03%:  it's hell
0.03%:  this is the last
0.03%:  it's all I know
0.03%:  what he did was write some code
0.03%:  this is making me wish I was
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how well these
0.03%:  it's still kinda weird how
0.03%:  all I've done is rec
0.03%:  it's his 
0.03%:  what I've done here is called
0.03%:  while I'm doing
0.03%:  I'm the one who did
0.03%:  it works
0.03%:  this is real
0.03%:  I'd still like him to answer
0.03%:  it's made him world
0.03%:  it's still kind
0.03%:  I read it while
0.03%:  we call these things
0.03%:  it was me who gave
0.03%:  there's a com
0.03%:  it's more like he died
0.03%:  that's the world we lived in;
0.03%:  I hear
0.03%:  while we're still
0.03%:  it's not clear who the
0.03%:  that was kinda
0.03%:  it's kinda cool
0.03%:  we gave him the name
0.03%:  it's when he asked
0.03%:  while we're at it might as well do
0.03%:  it's more like he's second dad
0.03%:  wait that's a
0.03%:  I tried making this
0.03%:  he's still alive so I think
0.06%:  he's still alive so I think we
0.06%:  he's still alive so I think we'
0.03%:  this video
0.03%:  while we're at it I might as well take
0.03%:  I don't see how we'll ever make
0.03%:  I don't see how we'll ever make this
0.03%:  I might've messed those
0.03%:  all he did was make the
0.03%:  this is what I wrote
0.03%:  I think we all agreed
0.03%:  this makes it worse
0.03%:  it's weird how that'
0.03%:  what I think we'll
0.03%:  this whole tim
0.03%:  I don't like this world at
0.03%:  he's worked on this
0.03%:  it reads like
0.03%:  all he said
0.03%:  when I was
0.03%:  what he's called is like
0.03%:  there's a nice
0.03%:  I've got this weird
0.03%:  this is making me scared
0.03%:  he did the same
0.03%:  I wrote this in like
0.03%:  I wish there
0.03%:  I've made this entire
0.03%:  the word'
0.03%:  I think we've all lost here
0.03%:  there's 
0.03%:  while we're at it I'd like some
0.03%:  his name's still
0.03%:  that's how it goes
0.03%:  I've made him this;
0.03%:  I've got to write
0.03%:  it's hard to decide what I
0.05%:  it's hard to decide what I like
0.06%:  it's hard to decide what I like less
0.03%:  it's hard to decide what I'
0.03%:  we call the latter
0.03%:  that was the work
0.03%:  I'm glad we had
0.22%:  I'm glad we had this little
0.04%:  I'm glad we had this talk;
0.03%:  he's alive and well right
0.03%:  what I did there was take some
0.03%:  it makes him the world's oldest active
0.03%:  he's good
0.03%:  while we're at it let's make him
0.03%:  since he
0.03%:  since he's dead
0.03%:  we can't talk
0.03%:  I'm adding
0.03%:  all I've done is write this
0.03%:  I don't have the skills
0.03%:  I think this idea
0.03%:  I think we'll leave the
0.03%:  wait did
0.03%:  what I'd like to do right
0.03%:  this makes his
0.03%:  I kinda wish he were
0.03%:  we all have
0.03%:  this is the single
0.03%:  this is the single worst
0.03%:  he's still alive; it's weird
0.03%:  I've no idea who he
0.03%:  that's all I have time
0.03%:  it's kinda weird how I'
0.04%:  it's kinda weird how I've
0.03%:  I'm taking this
0.03%:  it's the world we lived in eight
0.03%:  we think it
0.07%:  we think it's more
0.06%:  we think it was
0.05%:  we think it's called
0.03%:  that makes more
0.03%:  what it's done is give me the
0.03%:  that verse
0.03%:  I think we live
0.03%:  all he did was get
0.03%:  it does make
0.07%:  it does make him
0.03%:  it does make him that
0.03%:  he's well
0.03%:  no that
0.06%:  no that's weird
0.03%:  I think he's lived
0.03%:  all I did was give
0.03%:  all I did was give him the
0.04%:  all I did was give him the nick
0.03%:  it's more like he's called that
0.03%:  it's called like
0.03%:  all his work is
0.03%:  I'd still like to see what
0.03%:  give
0.03%:  give him
0.07%:  give him the award
0.03%:  give me a sec
0.03%:  I've said this like
0.04%:  I've said this like three
0.03%:  there's this one
0.03%:  he's still alive and he got
0.03%:  I've got no idea where he
0.03%:  I think that's less
0.03%:  he never said this
0.03%:  it was his 
0.03%:  that's a lie he died
0.03%:  I've had this idea
0.03%:  I'd rate
0.03%:  I'd rate him
0.03%:  it's more like the two
0.03%:  let's call him
0.03%:  we've made him the
0.03%:  give me a second while
0.03%:  I think it's time we
0.03%:  it's most
0.03%:  it's not clear how we'll
0.03%:  it's more like he's made it
0.03%:  what I've said here doesn
0.03%:  it's kinda weird that we have
0.03%:  there's a whole tim
0.03%:  now that I've made
0.03%:  this was the weird
0.03%:  this is all I have
0.03%:  where did I leave
0.03%:  he died last week; this
0.03%:  there's a lot I'
0.03%:  I've made him all
0.03%:  all he did was make some
0.03%:  it's made him that twice
0.03%:  I think he's still more
0.03%:  it's making me cr
0.03%:  wait I'm making it
0.03%:  it's a slight
0.03%:  it's a more
0.03%:  what I did there was make it
0.03%:  I might've made that word
0.03%:  we're almost
0.03%:  he tried
0.03%:  the song is
0.05%:  the song is called
0.03%:  he's gone
0.03%:  I think we're mis
0.03%:  this makes him a
0.03%:  the world has
0.03%:  the '
0.03%:  what I'd like right now is some ice
0.03%:  it's making him old
0.03%:  I've worked
0.03%:  I've still got some
0.03%:  it kinda
0.03%:  he's still alive; this
0.03%:  it's more like all
0.03%:  this makes me wish I were
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad that
0.03%:  I'm kinda glad that'
0.05%:  I'm kinda glad that's over
0.25%:  I'm kinda glad that's over with
0.03%:  I wrote this while locked
0.03%:  that's the least weird
0.03%:  this has made me sick
0.03%:  he's all
0.03%:  while we're at it I've added the
0.03%:  I like the idea
0.03%:  I might have taken
0.03%:  I think we've all agreed it
0.04%:  I think we've all agreed it's the
0.03%:  it's made me write
0.03%:  this is all I've got!!
0.03%:  he's a nice
0.03%:  I'm making his thesis
0.03%:  it's hard to tell what's sem
0.03%:  we call it that
0.03%:  that's wrong; I've
0.03%:  it's when he worked
0.03%:  I kinda messed with
0.03%:  I kinda messed with the words
0.03%:  he's still living;
0.03%:  I've got to write this
0.03%:  this wasn
0.03%:  this might make it worse
0.03%:  he called this
0.03%:  man I'
0.03%:  no this
0.03%:  it's making me wish I'd called
0.03%:  I don't like that
0.03%:  it's all the work
0.03%:  who the
0.03%:  this is the worst tim
0.03%:  that's all we have
0.03%:  right now I've
0.03%:  this is the world I've wanted
0.03%:  it's kinda what
0.03%:  he died last week and this
0.03%:  he's dead so he
0.03%:  it was '
0.03%:  he was given this award
0.03%:  he's worked with
0.03%:  that was more like his
0.03%:  I think we've all got
0.03%:  this is all I've heard
0.03%:  he's more into
0.03%:  I've called it
0.03%:  there's like twelve names
0.03%:  that's a weird name
0.03%:  I named
0.04%:  I named him
0.03%:  this is like the world's most
0.03%:  let's change the word
0.03%:  this is making me wish I'd called
0.03%:  this is wrong;
0.03%:  I think it's less
0.03%:  I wrote all this down while
0.03%:  I think he's a great
0.03%:  I'd like to hear his views
0.03%:  I'm making this sh
0.03%:  it's making him less
0.03%:  it's the same words twice
0.03%:  what I did there is take
0.03%:  there's like a decade
0.03%:  I still think he
0.09%:  I still think he's awesome
0.05%:  I still think he's more
0.04%:  I still think he's dead
0.04%:  I still think he's great
0.03%:  I still think he's a
0.03%:  I'd like the
0.03%:  it's kinda what he did
0.03%:  it also
0.03%:  it also made
0.06%:  it also made him the
0.03%:  I'm the one who'
0.04%:  I'm the one who's made
0.03%:  I'd still take
0.03%:  I wrote all these things
0.03%:  I think he screw
0.03%:  I asked him to write the
0.03%:  I was making all
0.03%:  this is a met
0.03%:  I'd have to write
0.03%:  I wrote that in
0.03%:  that never
0.03%:  this is where I'm losing
0.03%:  I'd like a
0.03%:  with this
0.03%:  all he did was derive some
0.03%:  he's still alive and there's a
0.03%:  it's more like he's doing
0.03%:  it's more like he's added
0.03%:  I don't see him listed
0.03%:  what I've said there doesn
0.03%:  that's a clever
0.03%:  this is so
0.03%:  we've got like three
0.03%:  it might have more
0.03%:  I have it right
0.03%:  I heard it's called
0.03%:  wait he's still alive!!
0.03%:  what I think is
0.03%:  he was making the
0.03%:  it's not clear what he likes
0.03%:  the word I wanted
0.03%:  we added the last line
0.03%:  I might've taken
0.03%:  it's hard to tell what's making me c
0.03%:  it's me who's making these
0.03%:  it's him who wrote
0.03%:  he's still alive so I'm kinda
0.03%:  it's a secret
0.03%:  this went
0.03%:  while we're at it we might want
0.03%:  we've called this
0.03%:  he died this week;
0.03%:  we've had this song
0.03%:  we've all agreed that we'd
0.03%:  I like this new world so
0.03%:  while we're at it we might as well tack
0.03%:  wait I don
0.03%:  the song was
0.03%:  this is how I've
0.03%:  what I'm asking
0.03%:  I know him
0.03%:  he never did ask
0.03%:  it's made him sort
0.03%:  wait I was
0.03%:  it's never made me
0.03%:  I'm adding the
0.03%:  it's all the words
0.03%:  it's a math degree
0.03%:  it gives him the same
0.03%:  there's a whole movie called
0.03%:  this new world is awesome
0.03%:  he's still alive so I'm making this
0.03%:  I read the whole
0.03%:  I don't have the skills to write
0.03%:  I'd heard the
0.03%:  he'd never talked
0.03%:  we've all agreed that we'd like
0.03%:  she's more
0.05%:  she's more like
0.03%:  she's more like his
0.03%:  I'd like to see which
0.03%:  this doesn't work well at
0.03%:  I lied this whole time and
0.03%:  I lied; he was
0.03%:  I think there is
0.03%:  that gives me some weird
0.03%:  we'll give him a
0.03%:  we'll give him a medal
0.03%:  we'll give him a doctor
0.03%:  that's weird that
0.03%:  all this makes
0.03%:  that line was
0.03%:  we all know this
0.03%:  I might still have
0.03%:  it's mis
0.03%:  that's all the words
0.03%:  that was where
0.03%:  he died last week and I've
0.03%:  I knew him
0.03%:  I think it's easier
0.03%:  wait this doesn't work I
0.03%:  that seems like it might'
0.03%:  that's like all
0.03%:  where did I get that second
0.03%:  it's making me wish we lived
0.02%:  that's a lie; he's still
0.02%:  I might've kinda made it
0.02%:  that doesn't work as well the
0.02%:  that last line makes him
0.02%:  now I've made
0.04%:  now I've made him
0.02%:  it's more like he got the
0.02%:  that's weird now
0.02%:  I'm doing this with
0.02%:  while we're at it I have
0.02%:  we think it was called
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in ages
0.02%:  I've missed
0.03%:  I've missed the
0.02%:  he ended
0.02%:  that line made
0.02%:  it's called the world
0.03%:  it's called the world wide
0.02%:  I might've made the last word
0.02%:  I'm the one who said
0.02%:  I'll show
0.02%:  it's weird how this came
0.02%:  he doesn't seem to have
0.07%:  he doesn't seem to have liked
0.02%:  these are his
0.02%:  this is the work
0.02%:  it's called the hard
0.02%:  he still works in
0.02%:  we had to change
0.02%:  what it's done is give me the world
0.02%:  we're having a little
0.02%:  it's more a thing
0.02%:  that's like the single
0.02%:  let's ignore the
0.02%:  there was a whole
0.02%:  what I've said here is all
0.02%:  he still lives with
0.02%:  that doesn't work as well with a
0.02%:  it's more like he's a mid
0.02%:  this doesn't have
0.02%:  I kinda did
0.02%:  I think their
0.02%:  his thesis was called
0.02%:  I think all
0.02%:  it's me who wrote it
0.02%:  he was raised
0.02%:  it made him the co
0.02%:  I like the word
0.02%:  that was all
0.02%:  I've done this twice
0.02%:  wait this doesn't work I've
0.02%:  that'd make his
0.02%:  he likes ice
0.02%:  I've still got the
0.02%:  it's had
0.02%:  I've got no idea what he's said
0.02%:  we all think
0.02%:  there's also like eight
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to tell them
0.02%:  we don't care what
0.07%:  we don't care what he likes
0.02%:  his dis
0.02%:  more like his sem
0.02%:  he named the
0.02%:  it still makes him a
0.02%:  that is the worst
0.02%:  he never asked the
0.02%:  it was called the '
0.02%:  it's making me wish I'd called this
0.02%:  I'd write
0.03%:  I'd write that

0.02%:  this is like the worst song I
0.03%:  this is like the worst song I've made
0.02%:  he still likes cheese
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how well this
0.02%:  I think we've said all
0.03%:  I think we've said all there
0.02%:  wait I'm still
0.02%:  it's like the sem
0.02%:  we've all agreed to switch the
0.02%:  it's kinda rad
0.02%:  he doesn't like it that
0.02%:  I've made him a little
0.02%:  it got
0.03%:  it got him
0.02%:  he's an
0.02%:  we think the
0.02%:  this last line
0.02%:  there's still like eight
0.02%:  that's all he wrote
0.02%:  it's on
0.02%:  what he did was draw
0.02%:  it's the second time
0.02%:  who writes
0.02%:  what I did there was made
0.02%:  that's racist
0.02%:  it's making me sad that

0.02%:  I kinda lied
0.03%:  I kinda lied there
0.02%:  this is where I'd like to leave
0.02%:  he's still alive so that's kinda weird!!
0.02%:  he's since moved
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree it
0.11%:  I think we'd all agree it's the
0.02%:  it's not a great
0.02%:  we've still got a while
0.02%:  this review
0.02%:  wait where'd this
0.05%:  wait where'd this come

0.02%:  his work is in
0.02%:  he's less
0.02%:  mine
0.02%:  he wrote a sem
0.02%:  I can't write like
0.02%:  it's a trick
0.02%:  I said the
0.03%:  I said the wrong
0.02%:  I'd still like to have
0.02%:  we'll have to re
0.02%:  I threw this
0.02%:  it's more like he's dead and
0.02%:  I think we've got a
0.02%:  I wrote this while sick and
0.02%:  that's like their
0.02%:  we've called that
0.02%:  his work is the
0.02%:  he doesn't live with
0.02%:  there's a limit
0.02%:  that makes the
0.02%:  it was the work
0.02%:  he did the sem
0.02%:  this is all I wrote
0.02%:  he's dead so it's kinda
0.02%:  we don't have to
0.02%:  that's a lie; he's more
0.03%:  that's a lie; he's more like
0.02%:  this makes a
0.02%:  it's the world we live in; I'
0.02%:  there's a dis
0.02%:  it's me who gets called
0.02%:  it's a song

0.03%:  I'm glad we solved the
0.02%:  all I did was look
0.02%:  wait I never
0.02%:  he was still alive
0.02%:  it's more that he solved
0.02%:  I'm glad this
0.02%:  it's more in
0.02%:  it's made him the dad
0.02%:  that's the worst I
0.02%:  what I'm doing is re
0.02%:  all we know is he
0.02%:  it's not clear who gets
0.02%:  he is still
0.02%:  I don't see how this will ever make
0.02%:  what it did was get him some
0.02%:  it's a thing he worked
0.02%:  this isn't right
0.02%:  it's kinda awesome how well
0.02%:  while we're at it can we get

0.02%:  I've added that line
0.02%:  it's a little weird how these
0.02%:  all I did there was make
0.02%:  I'd like to hear how
0.02%:  that last line might'
0.07%:  that last line might've worked
0.05%:  that last line might've made
0.03%:  that last line might've screw
0.03%:  that last line might've come
0.02%:  I'll see
0.02%:  I think some
0.02%:  I've made him that; it's like
0.02%:  that was the worst lim
0.02%:  that gives him like
0.02%:  he was more into
0.02%:  this gives me the idea
0.02%:  wait I don't have
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how we'
0.02%:  this is where I make
0.02%:  I'm glad this is the
1.27%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in;

0.02%:  it's more like a m
0.02%:  I'd like to ded
0.02%:  he was doing other
0.02%:  it's more like a slight
0.02%:  it doesn't have that
0.02%:  what I've said here is not
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how he came
0.02%:  it was called 'the
0.02%:  I wish he'd made
0.02%:  he dis
0.02%:  he's a little older
0.02%:  wait there was
0.02%:  I think this gives
0.02%:  I will never get
0.02%:  I wish he'd never said
0.02%:  he's never made
0.02%:  it's a tragic
0.02%:  it's weird how well these

0.02%:  he doesn't seem like the
0.02%:  the work is
0.03%:  the work is called
0.02%:  I might write a
0.02%:  that's all I've got; this
0.02%:  he called his work
0.02%:  all I did was switch the word
0.02%:  give him the medal
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree his
0.02%:  it's given him awards
0.02%:  it's more like he made a
0.02%:  I kinda wrote this while
0.02%:  wait this doesn't make him
0.02%:  he's this
0.02%:  he calls them
0.02%:  this is what we'
0.09%:  this is what we're doing

0.03%:  there's a video game that'
0.02%:  it's a little word
0.02%:  I gave him
0.03%:  I gave him that nick
0.02%:  it makes him what
0.02%:  his work is on
0.02%:  he did most
0.02%:  I kinda wish he were still
0.02%:  there's less
0.02%:  I added this
0.02%:  I'll admit the
0.02%:  I lied; the
0.02%:  I think we're close

0.02%:  that was kinda weird
0.02%:  it gave him his
0.02%:  it's so weird that
0.02%:  there's like a list
0.02%:  he's still alive and he goes
0.02%:  now that we've said it we might
0.03%:  now that we've said it we might as well work
0.03%:  now that we've said it we might as well do
0.02%:  I'll leave the rest
0.02%:  he's still alive; I'm making it
0.02%:  I know he's called
0.02%:  I made the last three
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in like two
0.02%:  this makes me glad
0.02%:  I liked the other
0.02%:  this is so weird
0.02%:  that gives me a weird
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well vote
0.02%:  I like this new world we've made so
0.02%:  that's kinda the weird
0.02%:  I think we're at
0.02%:  I'd call that

0.02%:  I lied there's like
0.02%:  that makes him a god
0.02%:  it's more like a child who
0.02%:  it's also where
0.02%:  while we're on that
0.02%:  that's a lie; the
0.02%:  he also did work
0.02%:  it's where the name came
0.02%:  i think
0.02%:  I'll need
0.02%:  I wrote this song while we
0.02%:  that's a thing we
0.02%:  we don't have time here
0.02%:  I made the last two
0.02%:  I had it
0.03%:  I had it wrong

0.02%:  while we're at it we can
0.02%:  while we're at it I'd like to go
0.02%:  it's made him a great
0.02%:  I gave him the
0.02%:  it's like called

0.02%:  this doesn't make him a god
0.02%:  we're the
0.02%:  this might've come
0.02%:  wait I'm having
0.02%:  it made him that like
0.02%:  I made that whole last
0.02%:  this makes me wish we were
0.07%:  this makes me wish we were living
0.03%:  this makes me wish we were still
0.02%:  no idea where
0.02%:  what I did there makes
0.02%:  I'm kinda still
0.02%:  it's a movie called
0.02%:  that's all we're doing with
0.02%:  he hates it
0.02%:  I'm a little sick
0.02%:  I'm a little sick right
0.02%:  it seems he didn
0.02%:  that's wrong I'
0.02%:  this is all kind
0.02%:  we've had like
0.02%:  I made them all
0.02%:  I'm kinda sad this

0.02%:  I messed with the words
0.02%:  it's more like he's the single
0.02%:  I might've missed the
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give me
0.02%:  I've got like 
0.02%:  I think we'd call him more
0.02%:  it's all in
0.02%:  I like cheese

0.02%:  all he did was give this
0.02%:  that's a lie; there
0.02%:  that's a lie; there's like
0.02%:  that's still kinda
0.02%:  that's still kinda weird
0.02%:  I think that's all we
0.02%:  given how
0.02%:  the same
0.02%:  I think it's great how
0.02%:  this is like the worst case
0.02%:  while we're at it I'm making
0.02%:  it was like the second
0.02%:  I've made the last
0.02%:  he wrote his dis
0.02%:  to
0.02%:  wait this doesn't work as
0.17%:  wait this doesn't work as well
0.06%:  wait this doesn't work as well with
0.03%:  wait this doesn't work as well as I'
0.02%:  it makes him a god
0.02%:  his middle name is the
0.04%:  his middle name is the word
0.02%:  this song is weird
0.02%:  he's still alive and his
0.05%:  he's still alive and his work
0.02%:  this is making the world
0.03%:  this is making the world seem
0.02%:  I can't get this
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in a while
0.02%:  his work did
0.02%:  I'd like to see the movie
0.02%:  I've got no idea where he'
0.02%:  we're still asking the
0.02%:  it's made him the doctor
0.02%:  these are all lies
0.02%:  what I've said here is 
0.02%:  I think we're almost
0.02%:  I swear this
0.02%:  while I've
0.02%:  while I've got this
0.02%:  that gives me an idea!!
0.02%:  that's like the worst line I've come
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to tell what's come
0.02%:  we've got some
0.02%:  I think he's a doctor
0.02%:  the whole world is like
0.02%:  wait I think there
0.06%:  wait I think there's some
0.02%:  all I did there was take
0.02%:  it has more
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well with me
0.02%:  what he did was make it
0.02%:  he is more
0.02%:  that one
0.02%:  that one's weird
0.02%:  the word I wanted was '
0.02%:  it's with
0.02%:  I think it was him
0.02%:  I saw the
0.03%:  I saw the word

0.02%:  I think he cares
0.02%:  I've named
0.02%:  here's a link
0.02%:  that's the origin
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we'd
0.02%:  his work is what
0.03%:  his work is what made
0.02%:  that gives me ideas!!
0.02%:  all he did was take
0.02%:  he's still alive so we'd
0.02%:  I never liked his
0.02%:  I kinda wish we'd solved
0.03%:  I kinda wish we'd solved the real
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who's a
0.02%:  I think he gave credit
0.02%:  I think that made
0.02%:  all I did was write the song
0.02%:  it's like the cool
0.02%:  this made me like
0.02%:  I kinda wish we'd still
0.02%:  I've made those
0.02%:  I made the latter
0.02%:  I've looked
0.02%:  we're at
0.02%:  it's still a thing
0.02%:  it's too
0.02%:  it's more like the two things
0.02%:  I'd still like to get
0.02%:  I wrote this in case
0.02%:  I think we'd still
0.02%:  he's still alive and the
0.02%:  I like him more
0.02%:  it's like his most
0.02%:  wait it's more
0.02%:  I'm real
0.02%:  that's great
0.02%:  it is a
0.02%:  it's made him a doctor
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last week!! I
0.02%:  it's the latter and
0.02%:  he made him
0.02%:  what he did was look
0.02%:  there's a mis
0.02%:  I wish this
0.05%:  I wish this were
0.02%:  it's more like a small
0.02%:  I've made him the doctor
0.02%:  this is the world we lived in last week so
0.02%:  that's the world we lived in last week I'
0.02%:  we think he died last
0.02%:  I don't get how he
0.02%:  it is more
0.02%:  that's his name
0.02%:  I've heard he likes it
0.02%:  it's like two words
0.02%:  wait there's like a whole
0.02%:  he's not like
0.02%:  he's more dad
0.02%:  what I've done is make
0.03%:  what I've done is make him
0.02%:  we still like
0.02%:  it's kinda great how well
0.02%:  coming
0.02%:  I'm tired now
0.02%:  I think there's a little
0.02%:  it doesn't make me sad
0.02%:  what it did was give him some
0.02%:  this is a thing
0.02%:  that's the cover
0.02%:  it's making him the world's oldest active
0.02%:  we're all like
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that he called
0.02%:  I did write this
0.02%:  he's closer
0.02%:  his degree is in math
0.02%:  while we're doing this let's also
0.02%:  we gave him the latter
0.02%:  it's more that he asked
0.02%:  it's kinda sweet how he wrote
0.02%:  he might've worked
0.02%:  this game is called
0.02%:  that's the world we lived in last week; we'd
0.02%:  I'm glad we had this talk now
0.02%:  I think we might've mess
0.02%:  I'd like to have the
0.03%:  I'd like to have the words
0.02%:  it's not like he
0.02%:  I'd have to read
0.02%:  it's a little worse
0.02%:  it's kinda mess
0.02%:  this might've all
0.02%:  that will
0.02%:  there was like a
0.02%:  wait this was
0.02%:  it's more like he's that
0.02%:  it's worth like 
0.02%:  the world's most
0.02%:  I think he'd call
0.02%:  it was called some
0.04%:  it was called some other things
0.02%:  it's more like he made this
0.02%:  we know he
0.02%:  that's less weird when
0.02%:  all I did here
0.02%:  where did I get all
0.06%:  where did I get all these
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we've come
0.02%:  it's more like how the
0.02%:  I come
0.02%:  it's all he ever did
0.02%:  I think he miss
0.02%:  that's like the worst name I
0.03%:  that's like the worst name I've come
0.02%:  we have some
0.02%:  it's the two things
0.02%:  that line makes me
0.02%:  hang
0.02%:  I'm having the
0.03%:  I'm having the worst
0.03%:  I'm having the worst time
0.02%:  it's all I'm
0.02%:  I'd still love
0.02%:  what made him one
0.02%:  he's still alive and is
0.02%:  he's called the god
0.02%:  he doesn't like it!!
0.02%:  this is the worst we
0.06%:  this is the worst we've done
0.03%:  this is the worst we've made
0.02%:  we're still in the middle
0.02%:  all I did was change words
0.02%:  we named him that
0.02%:  what I've said makes little
0.02%:  I love this
0.02%:  that might've made it worse; I'll
0.02%:  what I've said might
0.02%:  there's like a video game with
0.02%:  I think we've all read
0.02%:  we've all agreed it's not
0.02%:  what I said there doesn
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I got
0.02%:  the latter might
0.02%:  this makes the world
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he's solved
0.02%:  it's made him the world's oldest alive
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree the
0.02%:  it's like a weird
0.02%:  it's me who is
0.02%:  that's where I'm coming
0.02%:  I think we said
0.02%:  this seems like the worst idea
0.02%:  we never did
0.02%:  it was called other
0.02%:  that's how I'm
0.02%:  I lied there;
0.02%:  what it's made him was
0.02%:  it's more like he's in
0.02%:  it's me who has
0.02%:  this is when
0.02%:  I don't like this world we've made!!
0.02%:  the math'
0.02%:  this is what'
0.02%:  it's like I
0.02%:  there's a video game that's like
0.02%:  he doesn't get the
0.11%:  he doesn't get the credit
0.02%:  I was more
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we've come
0.02%:  I think there's a good
0.02%:  I have come
0.02%:  right now he's dead
0.02%:  now that I've said it it seems weird
0.02%:  I made that line
0.02%:  he's never looked
0.02%:  I'd like to see where this is
0.02%:  the movie
0.02%:  he never liked it
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how close these
0.02%:  it's all he talks
0.02%:  we've lost
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that he's still
0.02%:  it's also the
0.02%:  what he did was more like come
0.02%:  it's more like he gave a sem
0.02%:  it's called his
0.02%:  he's still alive so I think we'd
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last week I'
0.02%:  that was a weird thing
0.02%:  we all know him as the
0.02%:  I think he's good
0.02%:  I might have like
0.02%:  we've all come
0.02%:  we call him more
0.02%:  making this
0.02%:  it's also made him win
0.03%:  it's also made him win the
0.02%:  he might've done
0.02%:  it's kinda a weird
0.02%:  we'd all
0.02%:  let's change this
0.02%:  I'd give the
0.03%:  I'd give the award
0.03%:  I'd give the credit
0.03%:  I'd give the other
0.02%:  I might have a
0.02%:  we can still
0.02%:  there's a lot I don't like
0.02%:  I'd like to call
0.02%:  all the other
0.02%:  I had some
0.02%:  I chose
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to tell who gets
0.02%:  he's done work
0.02%:  the doctor'
0.02%:  that's more like 
0.02%:  it doesn't make him either!!
0.02%:  I'll leave that
0.02%:  I think we were still
0.02%:  he never said what
0.02%:  while we're at it I'd love to see
0.02%:  it's kinda gross how
0.02%:  there's a movie called this
0.02%:  the hard
0.02%:  now that I've worked
0.02%:  it doesn't work that
0.02%:  he's still doing active
0.02%:  it's more like he is
0.02%:  this made things
0.02%:  it's more like he added some
0.02%:  it was right
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he had
0.02%:  that's wrong; he did
0.02%:  he's not well
0.02%:  he's not well liked
0.02%:  I did a
0.02%:  that's a weird seg
0.02%:  it's like his sem
0.02%:  he's still alive and does work
0.02%:  I was mis
0.02%:  that's where we'
0.02%:  he's still alive; I might
0.02%:  wait he died
0.02%:  he might not
0.05%:  he might not like
0.02%:  he never said he likes it
0.02%:  we call him the latter
0.02%:  wait that doesn
0.23%:  wait that doesn't work
0.06%:  wait that doesn't work well
0.02%:  wait that doesn't rh
0.02%:  I think the word was '
0.02%:  we're having that
0.02%:  he's more like a mid
0.02%:  what's weird is that I'm making
0.02%:  the title was more
0.02%:  I kinda messed with the word
0.02%:  it's still an
0.02%:  I'd love to write
0.02%:  this might end
0.02%:  it's more like a dad who'
0.02%:  I don't have his degree
0.02%:  I heard it was
0.02%:  wait he never
0.02%:  where did I get this voice
0.02%:  I might've messed the
0.02%:  I don't see how this rel
0.02%:  it's me who made the
0.02%:  it's like the second sem
0.02%:  I don't see what's so weird
0.02%:  I think he's most
0.03%:  I think he's most well
0.02%:  it was when he wrote
0.02%:  there's two kinds
0.02%:  I don't care what he likes!!
0.02%:  it'll take me
0.02%:  all I've done is make him
0.02%:  it was over
0.02%:  it's not a real
0.02%:  it's all him
0.02%:  I'd call him more the god
0.02%:  I have a degree
0.02%:  it's all I've heard
0.02%:  it was cooked
0.02%:  I still don
0.21%:  I still don't like
0.02%:  I still don't get
0.02%:  I've made him all those
0.02%:  it's the world's most well
0.02%:  it's some other
0.02%:  I kinda messed this
0.02%:  I think we've all made some
0.02%:  it was like a
0.02%:  that's a made
0.02%:  it was more like his
0.02%:  what I've said there is all
0.02%:  he doesn't seem to have liked it
0.02%:  I don't see how this will make me
0.02%:  he's still alive so that's wrong
0.02%:  now that we're all
0.02%:  he knows
0.02%:  this is where I'm making
0.02%:  that's an
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad it's the
0.10%:  I'm kinda glad it's the world
0.02%:  I've no idea where the
0.02%:  I'm glad this is over
0.02%:  all I did was throw
0.02%:  I'd take
0.02%:  the thesis was
0.02%:  we're still coming
0.02%:  it's so awesome
0.02%:  I heard he liked
0.02%:  I lied; he's more
0.02%:  when I said sem
0.02%:  I think his real middle
0.02%:  there's this awesome
0.02%:  he loves
0.02%:  I'm the one who added
0.02%:  it's this week
0.02%:  I'm doing him
0.02%:  it's more like that'
0.02%:  it's more like that's what
0.02%:  it's like there
0.03%:  it's like there's two
0.03%:  it's like there's a whole
0.02%:  we'll give the award to the second
0.02%:  this'
0.02%:  this'll make
0.02%:  this'll make him
0.02%:  that made his work seem
0.02%:  all credit
0.02%:  it's hard to decide what is
0.02%:  this is the world we lived in last week I
0.03%:  this is the world we lived in last week I'
0.02%:  I wrote this in 
0.02%:  we got this
0.02%:  this whole time I've kinda
0.02%:  I might've added some lines
0.02%:  we don't call it '
0.02%:  I'm kinda sad this is where
0.07%:  I'm kinda sad this is where we've come
0.02%:  it's more like a middle child whose
0.02%:  that's wrong; he likes
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad this is over
0.02%:  this seems like a great
0.02%:  he worked in the
0.02%:  that gave me the
0.03%:  that gave me the will
0.02%:  he's worked in the
0.02%:  he doesn't seem like that
0.02%:  what he's most well
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad he
0.02%:  it's a thing with
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give some
0.02%:  this talk
0.02%:  we're all his
0.05%:  we're all his kids
0.02%:  all I did was write this down
0.02%:  it's clear that
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give the medal
0.02%:  he kinda hated
0.02%:  it's the world we still
0.02%:  now that I've said it it seems like
0.02%:  it's more that he's viewed
0.02%:  we all owe
0.02%:  I think it's where
0.02%:  it's the world we live in that
0.20%:  it's the world we live in that's made
0.07%:  it's the world we live in that's made me
0.03%:  it's the world we live in that makes
0.03%:  it's the world we live in that's made me do
0.02%:  it's the world we live in that makes me
0.02%:  that'd make it
0.02%:  we made this
0.02%:  it has like
0.02%:  we all like
0.02%:  it's all we'
0.13%:  it's all we've talked
0.02%:  he wrote the sem
0.02%:  I'd give it
0.02%:  this whole time I've said
0.02%:  that's where I stole
0.02%:  these are the same
0.02%:  this is the world we live in; I'
0.02%:  he said he was
0.02%:  I think we all missed
0.02%:  he was more a
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever had
0.02%:  I'll let him decide
0.03%:  I'll let him decide what
0.02%:  this gives me the will
0.02%:  I might've made that line
0.02%:  that doesn't work as a
0.02%:  he's dead so he'
0.02%:  I wrote this song while sick
0.02%:  I'll write
0.02%:  he'd hate
0.02%:  it's made him less
0.02%:  that's the worst I've made
0.02%:  there's a small
0.02%:  it's his nick
0.02%:  I've no idea which is
0.02%:  there's like two living
0.02%:  his work on the
0.02%:  wait I'm making that
0.02%:  there's also like two
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to tell with
0.02%:  it makes me wonder how
0.02%:  wait that was
0.02%:  it's more like he's in the middle
0.02%:  he's still alive so we can
0.02%:  this is an
0.02%:  I think he was review
0.02%:  that's hor
0.02%:  those two things were
0.02%:  I've said it wrong
0.02%:  it's more that we
0.02%:  we call his sem
0.02%:  it's still a thing where
0.02%:  it's me who is the
0.02%:  I'd like to change the word
0.02%:  that's what I'll
0.02%:  it makes him the co
0.02%:  we've all agreed that's his nick
0.02%:  he's still alive; I'd
0.02%:  that's how I'd like it
0.02%:  it's made him a whole
0.02%:  he's still alive and works with me at
0.02%:  I've lost all
0.02%:  I think he died two
0.02%:  this is where I've gone
0.02%:  god likes
0.02%:  that's like the second worst
0.02%:  it's the other two
0.02%:  it's all we're
0.02%:  I wrote all this while
0.02%:  it was more like his sem
0.02%:  I think he's called it
0.02%:  it's given him the award
0.02%:  wait wait
0.02%:  I think we've made some
0.02%:  it's the worst thing I've come
0.02%:  it makes him the dad
0.02%:  it's his dad who
0.02%:  I think we got
0.02%:  I did all
0.02%:  it's kinda his
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well as a
0.02%:  she likes
0.02%:  I'm now
0.02%:  while we're at it I might as well move
0.02%:  his middle name was '
0.02%:  it's more like he's the least
0.02%:  how did we get this
0.02%:  I don't recall his middle
0.02%:  it's secret
0.02%:  no it's the
0.02%:  there isn't a whole
0.02%:  he lived
0.02%:  that's the wrong decade
0.02%:  he doesn't like either
0.02%:  it's hard to tell these
0.02%:  this makes me glad I never
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who made
0.02%:  I think we might've lost
0.02%:  it's more like he's a dad with
0.02%:  read
0.02%:  since we're still
0.02%:  no he's dead
0.02%:  what I did there was make some
0.02%:  we've all kinda agreed
0.02%:  he's still alive so it's weird I
0.02%:  I've said all
0.03%:  I've said all this wrong
0.02%:  it's still him
0.02%:  he died last week so I
0.02%:  it's more like he got a
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in; I was
0.02%:  that makes me wonder how
0.02%:  wait I think we
0.03%:  wait I think we've
0.02%:  it's hard to decide who gets
0.02%:  while I'm at it this
0.02%:  it's like the same
0.02%:  he died over
0.02%:  he's worked on the
0.02%:  I'm a little sad
0.02%:  I've added some lines
0.02%:  I heard that
0.02%:  I missed the word
0.02%:  it talks
0.02%:  it's more that he was given
0.02%:  he did other
0.02%:  I do
0.03%:  I do like
0.02%:  where did I get that last
0.02%:  it made him an
0.02%:  it's his degree
0.02%:  I never got
0.02%:  he made a
0.02%:  wait that's his
0.03%:  wait that's his middle
0.02%:  that's kinda how we
0.02%:  I don't have the words
0.02%:  while we're doing this I'll
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he's dead
0.02%:  I made the word '
0.02%:  it's a little weird how he named
0.02%:  we'd all like
0.02%:  it's like some
0.02%:  we still don't like
0.02%:  it's a long
0.02%:  it's the second ever
0.02%:  where does
0.02%:  we've all agreed the
0.02%:  it's a single word with
0.02%:  we made it
0.02%:  it's hard to sing
0.02%:  I think the award
0.03%:  I think the award goes
0.02%:  that's like the worst case
0.02%:  this is all me
0.02%:  I'd heard he liked
0.02%:  that was some
0.06%:  that was some weird
0.02%:  where'd this come
0.02%:  it's his work that's sem
0.02%:  wait what the
0.02%:  I have the wrong
0.02%:  no I've made him
0.02%:  it's all I've read so
0.02%:  I've got no idea where that last
0.02%:  it's more like a middle child that
0.02%:  it's like their
0.02%:  the link
0.02%:  it's like a thing called
0.02%:  it's the thing
0.02%:  this is what I was
0.02%:  there's a lot I've
0.02%:  I might write the
0.02%:  it has made him get
0.02%:  it's making me tired
0.02%:  wait I screw
0.02%:  we still have no idea where
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well move on
0.02%:  I've no idea who's still
0.02%:  that's kinda a
0.06%:  that's kinda a weird
0.02%:  it's the whole class
0.02%:  that makes me wish we
0.05%:  that makes me wish we lived
0.02%:  that makes me wish we were
0.14%:  that makes me wish we were living
0.05%:  that makes me wish we were still
0.26%:  that makes me wish we were still living
0.02%:  it's him who gets called
0.02%:  there's also like a
0.02%:  that makes me wish we were still doing
0.02%:  this is the world we lived in last week; I made
0.02%:  what he did was less
0.02%:  it's making me th
0.02%:  while we're doing this we
0.02%:  while we're at it we've
0.02%:  that's all I'm doing
0.02%:  that's all I'm doing here

0.04%:  I might like this new world we've made
0.02%:  it's kinda rad how
0.02%:  I don't see how he's made
0.02%:  it's weird that he's named
0.02%:  I have more
0.02%:  that's still a

0.02%:  he's still living so
0.02%:  I like it when he'
0.04%:  I like it when he's called

0.02%:  I'm kinda glad we solved the whole
0.02%:  I knew this
0.02%:  I knew this was
0.02%:  I've made things worse with
0.02%:  I liked this idea
0.02%:  it's more like his whole
0.02%:  he's like the most
0.02%:  right now I'd
0.02%:  right now I'd like
0.02%:  this is all wrong; I've made
0.02%:  that's what made
0.02%:  I wrote the second
0.02%:  it's not clear how he's viewed
0.02%:  it's made him the co
0.02%:  he's more called
0.02%:  it's more like he wanted
0.02%:  it's still the same world we'
0.02%:  wait it's wrong
0.02%:  I wrote this weeks
0.02%:  that makes me want
0.02%:  let's take
0.02%:  what I've said there makes me
0.02%:  it's hard to tell whose
0.02%:  that is where
0.02%:  this is making me sad;
0.02%:  I think he's still alive so we'd
0.02%:  when I tried
0.02%:  in this world we'
0.02%:  it's more like twelve
0.02%:  it's a kind
0.02%:  while we're at it let's add the second
0.02%:  it's his most
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we've ended
0.02%:  he's never said how
0.02%:  it's less well
0.02%:  what I'd like to do is have
0.02%:  it's more like class
0.02%:  he's alive and he
0.02%:  it's more like these
0.02%:  all he did was ask the
0.02%:  this is the world we now
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give him an
0.02%:  it's more '
0.02%:  what I've said is the
0.02%:  I think we've all agreed it's time
0.02%:  it's more like he did some things
0.02%:  all I've done with
0.02%:  it's hard to make the
0.02%:  I'd like to claim
0.02%:  he died last week so I'
0.02%:  it's me who's making the
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he ever did
0.02%:  I'm aware
0.02%:  while we're at it let's switch
0.02%:  what I'd like to see is the
0.02%:  we don't like his
0.02%:  what it's done is made him well
0.02%:  it's cool
0.02%:  all I've done is switch
0.02%:  it comes with
0.02%:  it's a list
0.02%:  I've no idea who's right
0.02%:  this is where I've got
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in as
0.02%:  what's that
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we've made
0.02%:  I like his other
0.02%:  I dream
0.02%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in t
0.02%:  that was me who did it
0.02%:  I've had the
0.02%:  I'd like to read
0.02%:  we all know the
0.02%:  that was his degree
0.02%:  I think we have some
0.02%:  what it did was give the world
0.02%:  there's a thing called a
0.02%:  I'm making his whole
0.02%:  wait I've got it
0.02%:  we've still got the same
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we call
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we call him
0.02%:  it's said he
0.02%:  all he did there
0.07%:  all he did there was give
0.03%:  all he did there was come
0.02%:  I have to admit
0.02%:  I've made him that on
0.02%:  I made that name
0.02%:  there's a law
0.02%:  he might've made
0.02%:  the latter is a
0.02%:  I'm mess
0.02%:  it has given him some
0.03%:  it has given him some credit
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give the second
0.02%:  it's almost like
0.02%:  all I've got is this weird
0.02%:  we're still like
0.02%:  she wrote
0.02%:  how did this
0.03%:  how did this get
0.02%:  he's got like twelve
0.02%:  it doesn't make him god

0.02%:  I've tried to make
0.02%:  that kinda
0.02%:  we've all had
0.02%:  I lied; there
0.02%:  it's the world's least
0.02%:  I think he's well
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to give
0.02%:  now that I'm review
0.02%:  asking
0.02%:  asking him
0.02%:  it was named the
0.02%:  that's the world we lived in like two
0.02%:  I might write some
0.02%:  no wait that's weird

0.02%:  he drew
0.02%:  I don't care what he'
0.09%:  I don't care what he's like
0.02%:  I've no idea how the
0.02%:  what's the word limit
0.02%:  I think he got it
0.02%:  where'd this song
0.02%:  I'm glad we've
0.02%:  it's all he's ever done!!
0.02%:  all the work
0.02%:  it's him and
0.02%:  that does
0.02%:  that's not what
0.02%:  I've made him a god
0.02%:  I'd give him
0.08%:  I'd give him the credit
0.02%:  I'd give him the award
0.02%:  it makes him the grand
0.02%:  when he asked
0.02%:  there's tons
0.02%:  I've made some ed
0.02%:  this made his work
0.02%:  the word 'the
0.02%:  three
0.02%:  we still have the word
0.02%:  listen I'
0.02%:  his most
0.02%:  we've gotta
0.02%:  the reason
0.02%:  I was making these
0.02%:  it doesn't work well with a
0.02%:  this song makes him
0.02%:  wait he's called
0.02%:  it's as
0.02%:  it's made him a little
0.02%:  I lied he never
0.02%:  I lied he never said
0.02%:  he's still alive and we might
0.02%:  while we're at it I might as well send
0.02%:  making the
0.02%:  I think it's a good
0.02%:  it doesn't work with his
0.02%:  it doesn't work with his middle
0.02%:  he doesn't like his middle
0.02%:  the cover
0.02%:  all I've read is his
0.02%:  this is a lie I
0.02%:  I'd like to see a
0.02%:  I made some things
0.02%:  that's like his second
0.02%:  it gives him the nick
0.02%:  he got his nick
0.02%:  I'm doing the whole
0.02%:  this whole time I was asking
0.02%:  it's making me wish I'd said
0.02%:  all he did was coin
0.12%:  all he did was coin the terms
0.07%:  all he did was coin the word
0.05%:  all he did was coin the term '
0.02%:  wait that makes him
0.02%:  that's her
0.02%:  I was never good
0.03%:  I was never good with
0.02%:  I lied it
0.04%:  I lied it's called

0.02%:  I lied it was
0.02%:  I lied it's the other
0.02%:  what he did is write
0.02%:  what he did is write down
0.03%:  what he did is write down some
0.02%:  it's a thing he wrote
0.02%:  I have no idea who's still
0.02%:  that's all we're doing this
0.02%:  I have no idea who writes
0.02%:  I think we've all agreed we
0.02%:  it's more like he was given that
0.02%:  it's the world we live in I
0.03%:  it's the world we live in I'm most
0.02%:  his other sem
0.02%:  there's some slight
0.02%:  we still need a
0.02%:  I'm not 
0.02%:  there's no time
0.02%:  I wrote this down while we talked
0.02%:  I don't get how he's called
0.02%:  that's kinda mess
0.02%:  I think what's more
0.02%:  I think it's worth a
0.02%:  that's a lie; he died
0.02%:  these are the two
0.02%:  it's still the same old
0.02%:  this is making it worse!!
0.02%:  this makes me wish I'd gone to law
0.02%:  that's where I've got
0.02%:  I like how the
0.02%:  we've all made that
0.02%:  what I've said there isn
0.02%:  this is the world we lived in last week; I got
0.02%:  I'm good with either
0.02%:  it's still kinda hard
0.02%:  that's one
0.02%:  I get this
0.02%:  I wish he were
0.03%:  I wish he were still
0.02%:  we'll give him that title
0.02%:  now that we've said this
0.02%:  his work is still
0.02%:  he might've said it
0.02%:  he might've said it was
0.02%:  this will make me
0.02%:  we're still on
0.02%:  I'm doing that
0.02%:  it's a little weird how he got
0.02%:  it's what made him a
0.02%:  he's here
0.02%:  that's the world I
0.02%:  it's more like he's given that
0.02%:  I've got his email
0.02%:  wow that rh
0.02%:  since the
0.02%:  I think he's over
0.02%:  I'm wrong it
0.04%:  I'm wrong it's called
0.03%:  I'm wrong it's called the
0.02%:  I'm wrong it's the
0.02%:  he's given a

0.02%:  we gave him the award twice
0.02%:  it's the second word that makes
0.02%:  that's wrong; it's like the
0.02%:  I lied this was
0.02%:  I'd like to see where this goes!!
0.02%:  he's still at work
0.02%:  I am still
0.02%:  that's sick
0.02%:  he'd never met
0.02%:  what it's done is make him get called
0.02%:  I think we've all made the
0.02%:  when I read his
0.02%:  I think that's mis
0.02%:  wait we're living
0.02%:  we've all agreed this is the most
0.02%:  wait that's making
0.02%:  the last two
0.19%:  the last two lines were
0.64%:  the last two lines were added
0.10%:  the last two lines were made
0.04%:  the last two lines were added while
0.02%:  wait I've said
0.02%:  ignore
0.02%:  it's made him the one
0.02%:  it's weird to have
0.02%:  it's more like he's at
0.02%:  give me a second I
0.03%:  give me a second I'll
0.03%:  give me a second I'm still

0.02%:  we gave the
0.03%:  we gave the award
0.03%:  we gave the award to him
0.02%:  it's that weird
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to get the
0.02%:  what I meant is
0.02%:  he's asking
0.02%:  it's kinda called
0.02%:  I think he's a little more
0.02%:  it's more like he was this
0.02%:  the world we live in is so
0.02%:  it's a little weird how I've come
0.02%:  I'm having this weird
0.02%:  I kinda have
0.02%:  this is like the worst idea
0.02%:  it's weird that I'm even
0.02%:  I've got all
0.02%:  it was me who made that
0.02%:  I have like three
0.02%:  I've got like a
0.02%:  this is a good
0.02%:  I think we might call
0.02%:  he's given the latter
0.02%:  wow I think
0.02%:  I think he's a dad
0.02%:  while we're at it I'll change
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last time I
0.02%:  I wrote all those
0.02%:  that's lie
0.02%:  this sem
0.02%:  it's clear he didn
0.02%:  let's make it
0.02%:  I might have to read
0.02%:  I did all this
0.02%:  he doesn't work with
0.02%:  that's wrong; it's his
0.02%:  I don't write
0.02%:  what he did was solve some
0.02%:  all I did was switch some
0.02%:  we've all agreed not
0.02%:  wait that's wrong he died
0.02%:  I wrote a thesis
0.02%:  what I've said makes me
0.02%:  I'd like to see a world
0.02%:  it's like the most well
0.02%:  I'm so
0.02%:  don't c
0.02%:  he's still alive so I'm kinda screw
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who gets
0.02%:  what it's done is get
0.02%:  I heard the
0.02%:  I think it's god
0.02%:  I've added some lines there
0.02%:  wait he was
0.02%:  I made this last
0.02%:  it's like he was
0.02%:  I was wrong;
0.02%:  it's like his whole
0.02%:  all he did was write some math
0.02%:  this reads
0.04%:  this reads like
0.02%:  I lied; this
0.02%:  I might've kinda made this
0.02%:  that's the wrong ac
0.02%:  that made me sad
0.02%:  he's still asking
0.02%:  he died last week and I'm still
0.02%:  his work also
0.02%:  he died like a month
0.02%:  I might have liked
0.02%:  I have a degree in this
0.02%:  that's wrong; his middle
0.02%:  we're taking this
0.02%:  what I'm doing is read
0.02%:  how did we get on
0.02%:  how did we get on this track
0.02%:  while we're at it I've made
0.02%:  we might have to wait
0.02%:  he's not called
0.02%:  it makes me wish I had
0.02%:  he's at
0.02%:  we're doing this live
0.02%:  he might've died
0.02%:  I've read his sem
0.02%:  I've said more
0.02%:  we have no idea where
0.02%:  it's what makes
0.02%:  now I've read
0.02%:  now I've read this
0.02%:  the entire
0.02%:  wrote the
0.02%:  I've added a
0.02%:  I'm doing this live
0.02%:  it's making me wish this
0.02%:  it makes me wonder what'
0.02%:  I think he's made some
0.02%:  I don't care who likes it
0.02%:  it's like a song
0.02%:  I've not
0.07%:  I've not read his
0.02%:  I lied; his
0.02%:  we've talked
0.02%:  I think we call it
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we talk
0.02%:  it's given him some awards
0.02%:  I can see
0.02%:  what have
0.02%:  I think this is called
0.02%:  we were doing
0.03%:  we were doing this
0.02%:  all I know is there
0.02%:  all I know is there's this
0.02%:  where did I go
0.02%:  it's what got
0.02%:  this seems like the world
0.20%:  this seems like the world we lived
0.03%:  this seems like the world we'
0.03%:  this seems like the world we've
0.02%:  it's more like how he gave
0.02%:  I added the whole
0.02%:  it's called the 
0.02%:  there's so little
0.02%:  that'd make me
0.02%:  it was me who added
0.02%:  it was me who asked
0.02%:  while there
0.02%:  I think we'll leave this
0.02%:  it's like the same thing
0.02%:  I've sort
0.02%:  it's a real thing;
0.02%:  I think we have more
0.02%:  what's wrong with it
0.02%:  what he did was kinda
0.02%:  let's all agree this
0.02%:  I've added some things there
0.02%:  we're all in
0.02%:  it seems like he was more
0.02%:  wait I've made him
0.02%:  I think it's the world'
0.02%:  I think the word '
0.02%:  in his sem
0.02%:  I still need
0.02%:  it's his dad who gets
0.03%:  it's his dad who gets credit
0.02%:  I think there's a video
0.22%:  I think there's a video game called
0.02%:  while we're at it I'd like to name
0.02%:  it's a little weird when he
0.02%:  we've tried
0.02%:  he's still alive and he gets mad
0.02%:  he's a little racist
0.02%:  what I did there was link
0.02%:  now I've made him the
0.02%:  I admit this
0.02%:  we've got the
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree with me
0.02%:  that's all I've got down
0.02%:  it's the reason we'
0.02%:  I'd like to see what the
0.02%:  I'd like to see what the world
0.02%:  how did we end
0.02%:  this does make me wish
0.02%:  I've heard this is
0.02%:  he's cool
0.02%:  that's all I'm doing with
0.02%:  all he did was write some things
0.02%:  what it's done is make him a world
0.02%:  while we're at it he
0.02%:  all he did was write this
0.02%:  we've all agreed that we don
0.29%:  we've all agreed that we don't like
0.43%:  we've all agreed that we don't like this
0.18%:  we've all agreed that we don't like the
0.06%:  we've all agreed that we don't like his
0.05%:  we've all agreed that we don't like it
0.03%:  we've all agreed that we don't like him
0.03%:  we've all agreed that we don't like how
0.02%:  we've all agreed that we don't like those
0.02%:  where did I even
0.03%:  where did I even get that
0.02%:  I'd like to see him get
0.02%:  I lied and there
0.02%:  it's him who came
0.02%:  we don't call him the god
0.02%:  this makes me sad!!
0.02%:  it's made him kinda
0.02%:  it's a whole new
0.02%:  I've got no idea what that
0.02%:  I lied; he didn
0.02%:  it's making me re
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well with '
0.02%:  I think this is all
0.02%:  I don't see how this will ever get
0.02%:  it's hard to decide what's even
0.02%:  he's still alive and died
0.02%:  it's kinda weird the
0.02%:  I'd like to see what this
0.02%:  it's what he did in
0.02%:  it's made him dead
0.02%:  that was the most
0.02%:  I'd love to see him
0.02%:  we're good
0.02%:  I've no idea what he's talked
0.02%:  there's like two lines
0.02%:  he's never talked with
0.02%:  this is the worst we've all
0.02%:  it's more when
0.02%:  I think we gave
0.02%:  no wait I
0.03%:  no wait I'
0.02%:  no wait I've
0.02%:  I think there's less
0.02%:  it's a real thing called
0.02%:  it's the word '
0.02%:  I think we'd call it
0.02%:  this is more like the
0.02%:  it's well
0.03%:  it's well worth
0.02%:  it's well worth the
0.02%:  this is all wrong!!
0.02%:  I might've kinda messed it
0.02%:  that's what I've called it
0.02%:  he's still alive and we work
0.02%:  it's a little weird when we talk
0.02%:  what's great
0.02%:  there's also like 
0.02%:  he's said to like
0.02%:  now that I've said that
0.02%:  this is all the more
0.02%:  it's like two things
0.02%:  he's got some
0.02%:  it's what gave
0.02%:  there was a slight
0.02%:  when I look
0.02%:  that's a weird met
0.02%:  that all
0.02%:  wait no that's weird
0.02%:  he's dead since
0.02%:  where is
0.02%:  I wrote this last week when
0.02%:  I don't get how this makes
0.02%:  he's kinda more the
0.02%:  I've lost all track
0.02%:  I've like
0.02%:  there's a live
0.02%:  he gets the award
0.02%:  what I did there wasn
0.02%:  that's the world we live in; I'
0.02%:  she's a mother
0.02%:  it's weird how we
0.02%:  this is where I go
0.02%:  I'll change it
0.02%:  this doesn't work that
0.04%:  this doesn't work that well as a lim
0.02%:  we think he's still alive!!
0.02%:  I'd like to hear his sem
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how that's come
0.02%:  I think he's dead so we
0.02%:  I don't see what the
0.02%:  it's what he was
0.03%:  it's what he was doing
0.02%:  all he did was draw some
0.02%:  we're done
0.05%:  we're done with
0.07%:  we're done with this
0.02%:  I messed this
0.02%:  I think he's got more
0.02%:  I never said it
0.02%:  his work goes
0.02%:  all he did is
0.02%:  wait that's wrong;
0.02%:  there'll
0.02%:  there's like a thing
0.02%:  I'm not clear how
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that he'd
0.02%:  no I made him
0.02%:  he's still alive so it's weird we
0.02%:  he doesn't write like this
0.02%:  it's a small
0.02%:  wait I'm making this all
0.02%:  that's still where
0.03%:  that's still where we
0.03%:  that's still where we live
0.02%:  we all know that
0.03%:  we all know that'
0.02%:  that seems like the
0.05%:  that seems like the wrong
0.02%:  that seems like the worst
0.02%:  he was a little
0.02%:  what I've done there is make
0.02%:  the claim
0.02%:  it's hard to tell what makes
0.02%:  it's what his
0.02%:  it's like where
0.02%:  he's worked in this
0.02%:  I think it's hard to give
0.02%:  where'd that
0.05%:  where'd that come
0.02%:  this means
0.02%:  I think the term was
0.02%:  I've heard it's the
0.02%:  he's the world
0.02%:  I think it's more called the
0.02%:  I think we've missed the word
0.02%:  I don't get what's with
0.02%:  it's less like
0.02%:  at
0.02%:  I think that's all we're
0.02%:  when he did it
0.02%:  it's weird how close
0.02%:  it's weird how close that
0.02%:  while we're at it I've got this
0.02%:  I'd heard this was
0.02%:  we've all made it
0.02%:  I've no idea how that
0.02%:  while we're at it let's add some
0.02%:  I wrote a song
0.02%:  what he called it is
0.02%:  I like this new world we've got
0.02%:  I think we've got this
0.02%:  the world we live in makes him
0.02%:  he's still living!!
0.02%:  we're having the
0.02%:  he never asked that
0.02%:  it's what he said
0.02%:  wait he's not dead
0.02%:  I think these words
0.02%:  wait that's me
0.02%:  it's a god
0.02%:  he's dead so it's weird that we
0.02%:  I'll leave this here
0.02%:  the world we live in is math
0.02%:  it's a little weird when he's dead
0.02%:  that gave me the weird
0.02%:  it makes me wonder which is
0.02%:  there's a whole sem
0.02%:  this has made me decide
0.02%:  what I'd like right now is to
0.02%:  I might need to review
0.02%:  that's weird to
0.02%:  who wrote
0.02%:  who wrote this
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well come
0.02%:  I'd like to see the world we
0.02%:  I'd like to see the world we lived
0.02%:  where did he
0.02%:  it has given him credit
0.02%:  I think he does
0.02%:  wait a second this
0.02%:  it's a term he
0.02%:  he doesn't strike
0.02%:  it's now the world we'
0.02%:  is there even
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad the world
0.02%:  he doesn't live with me
0.02%:  I can't make the
0.02%:  I think he gets a
0.02%:  this is what we've
0.02%:  this is the end
0.02%:  I don't like either
0.02%:  his work doesn
0.06%:  his work doesn't have
0.02%:  his work doesn't seem
0.02%:  I think it's the word
0.02%:  it's all we have
0.02%:  I think we've made it clear
0.02%:  what he did was get
0.02%:  I've called him the
0.02%:  I've made a lot
0.02%:  that last line made
0.02%:  is there like
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he's called
0.02%:  this whole talk'
0.02%:  as I
0.02%:  he's got more
0.02%:  it's the entire
0.02%:  I think we missed him
0.02%:  I wanted to write
0.02%:  we all knew
0.02%:  all he did was write it
0.02%:  the whole time
0.02%:  the whole time I was making
0.02%:  we've kinda
0.02%:  he's dead so it's more like a
0.02%:  I think it's awesome
0.02%:  I think we've made a
0.02%:  it's called things like '
0.02%:  this doesn't seem like the worst idea
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I messed with
0.02%:  his sister
0.02%:  he's still alive so that's weird I
0.02%:  it also made him win
0.03%:  it also made him win the
0.02%:  I've made those words
0.02%:  let's get this
0.02%:  this whole time I've meant
0.02%:  it's more like I made that
0.02%:  he's still alive and wrote it
0.02%:  we still have to work
0.02%:  we've made him that twice now
0.02%:  I think we messed this
0.02%:  this makes no
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well as I'd wished
0.02%:  it's more like he's solved
0.02%:  that's a weird thing to call
0.02%:  the second is a
0.02%:  it's kinda sweet how he called
0.02%:  while he was
0.02%:  that is the world
0.23%:  that is the world we lived
0.03%:  that is the world we live in!!
0.02%:  wait did I mess
0.02%:  we still think
0.03%:  we still think he's alive
0.02%:  we still think he's awesome
0.02%:  we still think he's dead
0.02%:  what it did was give me the
0.02%:  I never said the
0.02%:  it's making me wish I'd read that
0.02%:  this has gone
0.02%:  it's kinda weird to call
0.02%:  I'm kinda gross
0.02%:  he's had little
0.02%:  I wrote that down while we
0.02%:  who are
0.02%:  this does make me wonder
0.03%:  this does make me wonder what
0.02%:  it's the reason he
0.03%:  it's the reason he's called
0.02%:  it's more like he'll get
0.02%:  I liked it when
0.02%:  how did we even get this
0.02%:  it's more like he went
0.02%:  I'm the one who came
0.02%:  that doesn't work well as a lim
0.02%:  I've heard it's called the
0.02%:  I think he died ages
0.02%:  he's doing well
0.02%:  where did I get the last
0.02%:  that name
0.02%:  that doesn't work well with '
0.02%:  I don't see how he gets
0.08%:  I don't see how he gets credit
0.02%:  he'd never called
0.02%:  what he did was make some clever
0.02%:  it was all the
0.02%:  he's also the
0.02%:  I think we did this
0.02%:  it's clear he was
0.02%:  we can't write
0.02%:  it's kinda weird to have
0.02%:  there's also some
0.02%:  he's still alive and it's more
0.02%:  he's still alive; I made him
0.02%:  he'd never asked
0.02%:  I'd like to see his sem
0.02%:  what it's done is made him get called
0.02%:  he's dead so it's kind
0.02%:  while we're at it might I
0.02%:  it's more like he was given this
0.02%:  as I write
0.02%:  I kinda wish he'd made it
0.02%:  there's this movie coming
0.02%:  I think he was more called
0.02%:  this was the wrong time
0.02%:  I might've made it worse
0.02%:  I did all the
0.05%:  I did all the work
0.02%:  I have made this
0.02%:  I think he's solved
0.02%:  I might need to review this
0.02%:  I write the
0.02%:  he doesn't have time
0.02%:  he's the world's oldest
0.08%:  he's the world's oldest living mat
0.02%:  we're done with that
0.02%:  those were his middle
0.02%:  it's her
0.02%:  I made those rh
0.02%:  it's more that he'd
0.02%:  that's his real middle name!!
0.02%:  things have
0.02%:  there's like a song
0.02%:  there's like a long
0.02%:  there've
0.02%:  it means
0.02%:  it's hard to make him
0.02%:  this all seems
0.02%:  this all seems like
0.02%:  what's weird is I
0.02%:  it's more like a son
0.02%:  there I
0.02%:  I might've kinda screw
0.02%:  it's the world we live in as
0.02%:  these were two
0.02%:  we call these kinds
0.02%:  we don't have time to talk
0.02%:  that's a lie there
0.02%:  that's a lie there's like
0.02%:  the latter is the
0.02%:  we've all worked
0.03%:  we've all worked on this
0.02%:  I'd like to draw
0.02%:  I've gone cross
0.02%:  I've made the word
0.02%:  I might've made these
0.02%:  that's what I like
0.02%:  I've no idea how he
0.02%:  there's still the
0.02%:  it's making me wish we had
0.02%:  since we've
0.02%:  he's alive and worked with
0.02%:  that's come
0.02%:  there's like eight names
0.02%:  I've heard his
0.02%:  I did write the
0.02%:  there was a sem
0.02%:  this is making me hate
0.02%:  it's like the two things
0.02%:  what I've said there is 
0.02%:  he died the
0.02%:  it's the whole world
0.02%:  sir I
0.02%:  we'll give him credit
0.02%:  it's the world we live in; we
0.02%:  he isn
0.05%:  he isn't dead
0.02%:  I might re
0.02%:  these last two lines were added with
0.02%:  that's this
0.02%:  I think he cried
0.02%:  I've messed it all
0.02%:  I've made all these
0.02%:  I've made all these words
0.02%:  I think we get
0.02%:  I might've messed that last
0.02%:  I think we might've screw
0.02%:  this isn't that
0.02%:  it's done
0.02%:  this made it
0.02%:  there was like 
0.02%:  I've no idea what that
0.02%:  no it's a
0.02%:  it's more like logic
0.02%:  it's more what he did in
0.02%:  I still like him more when
0.02%:  he's still alive and he wrote some
0.02%:  I hate this
0.02%:  I hate this world
0.02%:  we've made him the latter
0.02%:  the latter's a
0.02%:  that's how we got
0.02%:  I don't see how the
0.02%:  it's making me weird
0.02%:  I made this entire
0.02%:  he died last week; this was
0.02%:  I don't like this world we've made at
0.02%:  there's a lot I'm making
0.02%:  that's when I
0.02%:  there's a slight com
0.02%:  I think it's called hard
0.02%:  we all live
0.02%:  I'm making it worse with
0.02%:  I'm making it worse with each
0.02%:  I'm wrong it was
0.02%:  this is where I wanted
0.02%:  it's more like a child's song
0.02%:  it's weird that we call them
0.02%:  he looks
0.02%:  it's more like he's this
0.02%:  he's still alive; that
0.04%:  he's still alive; that'
0.02%:  this is making me sad; I'
0.02%:  this isn't a good
0.02%:  all he did was write down these
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well with the sem
0.02%:  that's over
0.02%:  while I have
0.02%:  this whole time I've secret
0.02%:  that's more a
0.02%:  I think this will
0.02%:  I talked
0.02%:  I hear he likes
0.02%:  I'm still kinda sad
0.02%:  this made me kinda
0.02%:  it's more like he hang
0.02%:  that's where it got
0.02%:  it's a little weird how he came
0.02%:  we made him that
0.02%:  he's still alive so it's weird when
0.02%:  here's a video
0.02%:  he's still alive!! I'
0.02%:  it's making me write
0.02%:  I miss
0.02%:  he named his kid
0.02%:  that last word'
0.02%:  what I'd like is the
0.02%:  I don't care how
0.02%:  he'd still like
0.02%:  that's what it's called;
0.02%:  I'll admit there
0.02%:  I'll admit there's some
0.02%:  also
0.02%:  what he's worked
0.02%:  what he's worked on is called
0.02%:  he's kinda weird
0.02%:  we think it might
0.02%:  he was older
0.02%:  he gets like
0.02%:  this kinda
0.02%:  I think he gets mad
0.02%:  that's lies
0.02%:  I think he's more dead
0.02%:  while we're at it let's do
0.02%:  having read
0.02%:  it's more like he saw
0.02%:  I still like how
0.02%:  it's kinda clever
0.02%:  what I'd like is to
0.02%:  this is what's called
0.02%:  he's not that
0.02%:  it's called more
0.02%:  that's the second weird
0.02%:  ever
0.06%:  ever since I
0.03%:  ever since he
0.02%:  ever since I said
0.02%:  ever since the
0.02%:  ever since he died
0.02%:  now that I've said the word '
0.02%:  I'd call him more like the god
0.02%:  that is like
0.02%:  it's like he's never
0.02%:  I've not read it
0.02%:  that's screw
0.02%:  that made things worse!!
0.02%:  he doesn't get his
0.02%:  how did I
0.02%:  has
0.02%:  that last line might've wreck
0.02%:  I'm told
0.02%:  while I've got this mic
0.02%:  this does make me want
0.02%:  I'd like to clear
0.02%:  those were the same
0.02%:  we'll give him the last word
0.02%:  all I've read is this
0.02%:  cook
0.02%:  he's still alive and he's more
0.02%:  I've added that last line
0.02%:  I think he tried
0.02%:  this is where I lost
0.02%:  he did the work on
0.02%:  let's throw
0.02%:  he's got like seven
0.02%:  what he came
0.02%:  wait there's two
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how we've all
0.02%:  this makes me glad I'
0.02%:  it's more like he's viewed
0.04%:  it's more like he's viewed as the
0.02%:  I think we've wasted
0.02%:  what I think we'll do is give
0.02%:  that's what'
0.06%:  that's what's weird
0.02%:  it makes him second
0.02%:  it's a little weird to
0.02%:  it's mat
0.02%:  this is all I know right
0.02%:  I think we're all the
0.02%:  this gets me
0.02%:  that is the world we live in;
0.02%:  I've said the
0.03%:  I've said the word
0.02%:  I've said the wrong
0.02%:  let's call it the
0.02%:  what I'm doing here is ste
0.02%:  it's weird to talk
0.02%:  we gave him that last
0.02%:  there was no sem
0.02%:  I'm done with this game
0.02%:  all I did was change his
0.02%:  this isn't a real
0.02%:  it's that he
0.02%:  I've no idea what the words
0.02%:  his work in this
0.02%:  he never liked the
0.02%:  what it's done is get him killed
0.02%:  listen I've
0.02%:  he was a little more
0.02%:  its called
0.02%:  I think it's his degree
0.02%:  all I did was give him credit
0.02%:  what he said is
0.02%:  I make this
0.02%:  while he did
0.02%:  his more
0.02%:  that's the world we still
0.02%:  that's the worst I've done
0.02%:  it gave me
0.02%:  that's kinda che
0.02%:  I've no idea who his
0.02%:  he's still alive; I was making
0.02%:  that is the weird
0.02%:  I'm having a hard time disc
0.02%:  this leaves
0.04%:  this leaves me with more
0.02%:  this leaves me with some
0.02%:  I'd like to see him give
0.02%:  it was like two
0.02%:  it's made him do
0.02%:  this one
0.02%:  he doesn't have a degree
0.02%:  no wait this
0.02%:  where did I get the second
0.02%:  it's so weird that I'
0.02%:  it makes me wonder what the
0.02%:  it's a video game he
0.02%:  it's like he wrote
0.02%:  it made him less
0.02%:  we've done
0.03%:  we've done this
0.02%:  we all know his
0.02%:  we're having it
0.02%:  I think it's a clever
0.02%:  that's what drew
0.02%:  we gave him a
0.02%:  called the
0.02%:  I've no idea who writes
0.02%:  it made him get his
0.02%:  he got a
0.02%: ; I
0.02%:  I think he died over
0.02%:  it's what we
0.06%:  it's what we call the
0.05%:  it's what we call him
0.02%:  he was never asked
0.02%:  the word is like
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to tell how
0.02%:  I hadn
0.02%:  it's a m
0.02%:  we have to wait
0.02%:  I stole this
0.02%:  that'll make
0.02%:  it made me write
0.02%:  it made me write this
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well with this
0.02%:  I agree
0.06%:  I agree with him
0.06%:  I agree with the
0.02%:  I agree with his
0.02%:  I agree with this
0.02%:  he's still alive and he's worked at
0.02%:  I might've heard
0.02%:  the whole world's like
0.02%:  it was called that
0.02%:  with this new
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we've got
0.02%:  I think it's a weird
0.02%:  he's dead and it
0.02%:  while he did write
0.02%:  what he wrote was called
0.02%:  I wrote this while doing
0.02%:  all he did was write down what we've got
0.02%:  what it made him was get
0.02%:  I've tried to make this
0.02%:  all I did was take his
0.02%:  we can't tell
0.02%:  the whole world's kinda
0.02%:  I read this in
0.02%:  I've no idea where he
0.02%:  that's like the world's least
0.02%:  while we're at it I'd like to add the
0.02%:  can we talk
0.02%:  it's more a thing he
0.02%:  it's more a thing he did
0.02%:  it's more a thing he'
0.02%:  I talked him
0.02%:  while we're at it I'm adding the
0.02%:  we're making this shit
0.02%:  what I'd like to see is the world
0.02%:  that's the worst line I've come
0.02%:  those last two were
0.02%:  I've added all those
0.02%:  he still likes gr
0.02%:  that's how we know
0.02%:  he's a world
0.02%:  all I did was make the
0.02%:  it's like the whole world
0.02%:  it makes him a world
0.02%:  we'll give him that last
0.02%:  that's a lie he's never
0.02%:  what's weird is he
0.02%:  it's the whole second
0.02%:  that's what I did
0.02%:  it's more like he's made a
0.02%:  we'd call
0.03%:  we'd call him the
0.02%:  we'd call that
0.02%:  I never said this
0.02%:  what I've said there makes it
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how he's made
0.02%:  it's weird how all
0.05%:  it's weird how all these
0.02%:  he was in
0.02%:  that's the world we live in as
0.02%:  I wrote this a
0.02%:  I think we've made that worse
0.02%:  he doesn't go
0.02%:  he did make that
0.02%:  the work was called
0.02%:  this doesn't seem like it
0.02%:  this doesn't seem like it'll
0.02%:  the video
0.02%:  the video game is
0.05%:  the video game is called
0.02%:  he's said to have liked
0.02%:  that made me kind
0.02%:  it's weird that I'm having
0.02%:  with that
0.02%:  we're losing
0.02%:  this is like the second worst
0.02%:  the words in
0.02%:  I wish it
0.02%:  I wish it was
0.02%:  I wish it were
0.02%:  that's a lie; he's never
0.02%:  I like how it
0.02%:  it's more like he's now
0.02%:  he was later
0.02%:  all I've done is take
0.02%:  less
0.02%:  it's given me
0.02%:  it's more him having
0.02%:  this isn't the worst
0.02%:  all I'm doing here is c
0.02%:  it's hard to decide what we
0.02%:  we're still making that
0.02%:  the thing was
0.02%:  the thing was called
0.02%:  I think that's me
0.02%:  we still don't have a rig
0.02%:  I like this new world;
0.03%:  I like this new world; it's awesome
0.02%:  that made me like
0.02%:  all I did there was give
0.02%:  I'll never get sick
0.02%:  that's all wrong;
0.02%:  wait this doesn't seem
0.02%:  I still don't get how
0.02%:  it's more like he's almost
0.02%:  I'd call him the god
0.02%:  that's made me write
0.02%:  I lied it's called the
0.02%:  that last line made him
0.02%:  I lied he's still
0.02%:  it's the worse
0.02%:  this is the worst song I've made
0.02%:  those two are
0.02%:  this is the worst game
0.02%:  their name
0.02%:  it's what I've
0.02%:  now that I've said it there
0.07%:  now that I've said it there's like
0.02%:  wait there's a com
0.02%:  that's it right
0.02%:  it's what he wrote down
0.02%:  it makes him the world's oldest alive
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree it's his
0.02%:  he's more like god
0.02%:  I might've come
0.02%:  this is more like what
0.02%:  he was a child
0.02%:  I think we'd all agree it's his most
0.02%:  there's a song called
0.02%:  that's more like what I'd call
0.02%:  this is the second time
0.17%:  this is the second time I've made
0.16%:  this is the second time I've said
0.11%:  this is the second time I've read
0.04%:  this is the second time I've talked
0.02%:  this is the second time I've walked
0.02%:  this is the second time I've worked
0.02%:  this is the second time I've tried
0.02%:  it made his work
0.02%:  I never said he'
0.02%:  it's a little weird how this
0.02%:  it does have
0.02%:  he's still alive and he was
0.02%:  that's wrong; he's a
0.02%:  there's a middle
0.02%:  all I'm doing is re
0.02%:  what I've said here is a
0.02%:  this is sort
0.02%:  I made the doctor
0.02%:  he was dead
0.02%:  it doesn't have the words
0.02%:  we'll give him the medal
0.02%:  when I'
0.02%:  this has come
0.02%:  I looked that
0.02%:  we don't call him that; it'd
0.02%:  I like this new world the
0.02%:  I'd like to give the
0.03%:  I'd like to give the award
0.03%:  I'd like to give the credit
0.02%:  it's doing
0.02%:  the world was like
0.02%:  it's made him that in
0.02%:  he doesn't get credit as
0.02%:  the last three
0.02%:  he wrote a whole
0.02%:  I wrote all the
0.02%:  he did the same work
0.02%:  I'm glad this is the world we now
0.02%:  it's sad how
0.02%:  there is some
0.02%:  I need to work
0.02%:  he's still alive I was
0.02%:  I drew
0.03%:  I drew this
0.02%:  it made him the world's 
0.02%:  it's like hard
0.02%:  it's making me wish he
0.02%:  it's more a case
0.02%:  what he's done is more
0.07%:  what he's done is more like
0.02%:  it's more he
0.02%:  it was never called
0.02%:  it's made him dead wrong
0.02%:  it's a little weird how I've talked
0.02%:  it's like a sem
0.02%:  it's still me who
0.02%:  I'd like to call this
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how most
0.02%:  this is the worst week
0.02%:  what it did was show
0.02%:  it was his work in
0.02%:  that's a little weird how
0.02%:  he dies
0.02%:  I seem
0.03%:  I seem to have mis
0.02%:  I seem to have screw
0.02%:  there's like two sem
0.02%:  I think he'd said
0.02%:  no he's still
0.02%:  I might have to make
0.02%:  he's like dead
0.02%:  he's almost
0.02%:  he was doing it
0.02%:  it's more like a middle child that gets
0.02%:  I think it's weird how we
0.02%:  those might
0.02%:  that's what it's like living
0.02%:  we're doing a
0.02%:  I lied this whole time;
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we've talked
0.02%:  this gave me some
0.02%:  it's more like he was named
0.02%:  I think it was a
0.02%:  I still have no idea where
0.02%:  I gave him the nick
0.02%:  it's got me
0.02%:  the world we live in is like
0.02%:  I think we're still at
0.02%:  that's how I've
0.02%:  it's still the other
0.02%:  I've got it here
0.02%:  that's not where we'
0.02%:  I think we'll leave that
0.02%:  we've made it
0.02%:  the last thing
0.02%:  we have to get
0.02%:  how come
0.02%:  I don't like it either
0.02%:  was
0.02%:  I showed
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who was
0.02%:  what it did is
0.02%:  what it did is give
0.02%:  now that I've said it it makes
0.02%:  he died in the
0.02%:  it's me who writes
0.02%:  wait this is the
0.02%:  right now he's like
0.02%:  I've got a whole thesis
0.02%:  that's more like him
0.02%:  I might've made all those
0.02%:  I might've made all those words
0.02%:  we're a
0.02%:  we're a little light
0.02%:  that makes him even
0.02%:  how did I even
0.03%:  how did I even get here
0.02%:  I think these were
0.02%:  we don't call him '
0.02%:  I'm coming
0.02%:  he likes che
0.02%:  the real sem
0.02%:  it's making his sem
0.02%:  it's not clear what the
0.02%:  it doesn't work with all
0.02%:  he's got like two
0.02%:  this isn't the world we lived
0.02%:  I made his thesis
0.02%:  I might take
0.02%:  I'd give him credit
0.02%:  it gives him more
0.02%:  we've all agreed that it
0.02%:  all he did was write that
0.02%:  it doesn't make him that!!
0.02%:  that's a weird line
0.02%:  it's made his sem
0.02%:  it's like the worst sem
0.02%:  the world we live in is almost
0.02%:  I'd like to move
0.02%:  it's hard to see how we
0.02%:  his kids were the
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how close the
0.02%:  it's like the same words
0.02%:  that's what we were
0.02%:  that's what we were doing
0.02%:  I'm asking
0.02%:  I wrote this while coming
0.02%:  I wrote that while eating
0.02%:  I'm not aware
0.02%:  that gave me a weird
0.02%:  that's how we write
0.02%:  I get the
0.02%:  I might have added in
0.02%:  he's still alive I don
0.02%:  it's made him lots
0.02%:  that's called '
0.02%:  it's this week's theme
0.02%:  there'd
0.02%:  he never made
0.02%:  it's all I know how
0.02%:  I still like this
0.02%:  I'd like to see what he'd
0.02%:  it was called this
0.02%:  we'll give him the award twice
0.02%:  it's not clear who he
0.02%:  what I wanted
0.02%:  he never did that
0.02%:  it called
0.02%:  I think it's time we all
0.02%:  there's a divide
0.02%:  it's weird how he's still
0.02%:  I've worked this
0.02%:  all I've read is the title
0.02%:  this is where I'd like to end
0.02%:  he's alive so
0.02%:  it's hard to tell since
0.02%:  he's not dead either
0.02%:  these have
0.02%:  now that I've said them
0.02%:  I'd like to see him win
0.02%:  it's not clear what we
0.02%:  it's not clear what we'd
0.02%:  the review
0.02%:  wait I've got the
0.02%:  he's died now
0.02%:  it's like a thing with
0.02%:  what I'd like to see solved
0.02%:  what I'd like to see solved is the
0.02%:  it's his work in the
0.02%:  what I'm doing here is like
0.02%:  it's a word game
0.02%:  it's all he ever talked
0.02%:  I like how this is
0.02%:  we call them '
0.02%:  I think we'll give
0.02%:  I think we'll give him
0.02%:  the reason I'
0.02%:  we've all made him this
0.02%:  what he wrote was like
0.02%:  we live in the world with
0.02%:  he's still living I
0.02%:  it's like this whole new
0.02%:  it's more like he might
0.02%:  it's so well
0.02%:  he's still alive; I think we
0.02%:  it has the
0.04%:  it has the word
0.02%:  he gave this
0.02%:  I think he's moved
0.02%:  he's made me
0.02%:  I made that right
0.02%:  that gave me some
0.03%:  that gave me some weird
0.02%:  what I've said is all
0.03%:  what I've said is all wrong
0.02%:  it's more like he's on
0.02%:  it's weird that he was
0.02%:  this is making me wish we'd called
0.02%:  I'm not a
0.02%:  we have the wrong
0.02%:  he was doing the
0.02%:  that's wrong; he liked
0.02%:  it was given
0.02%:  I'll take credit
0.02%:  I think we've missed the word limit
0.02%:  it might have killed
0.02%:  he's still alive so it's kind
0.02%:  it makes me wish I was
0.02%:  he gave the talk
0.02%:  it's the world we didn
0.02%:  what I've done there is called
0.02%:  it's a he
0.02%:  it's weird how that makes
0.02%:  this gives me a head
0.02%:  there will
0.02%:  I'm having a crisis
0.02%:  that's weird since
0.02%:  I don't see how we'd ever get
0.02%:  he's dead now I
0.02%:  these ideas
0.02%:  did he
0.02%:  did he write
0.02%:  I think he'd called
0.02%:  I added in
0.02%:  it's more that he's dead
0.02%:  we've gone
0.02%:  what it did was give some
0.02%:  I'd give him more
0.02%:  we'd still
0.04%:  we'd still like to hear
0.03%:  we'd still like to hear what
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well do some
0.02%:  I'm aware this
0.02%:  I dreamt this
0.02%:  what I did there was move
0.02%:  it was kinda
0.02%:  it's like a single
0.02%:  it's like a single word
0.02%:  it's the reason we've
0.02%:  I'd love to see what
0.02%:  there's like tons
0.02%:  it's like a math
0.02%:  he's the one
0.02%:  I'm still kinda glad
0.02%:  it's more like he's the d
0.02%:  I read his sem
0.02%:  there's a god
0.02%:  it's worth like eight
0.02%:  I think he's more a dad
0.02%:  I think we'd all agreed
0.02%:  it's me who wrote all
0.02%:  it was me who wrote the last
0.02%:  this is a made
0.02%:  what it's done is give him more
0.02%:  we're all making
0.02%:  it makes me wish I'd chosen
0.02%:  what I did there was some
0.02%:  wait that's worse
0.02%:  he wrote down his ideas
0.02%:  he knew
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how close that
0.02%:  he's like the grand
0.02%:  I've made him that like
0.02%:  that's either
0.02%:  I still like it
0.02%:  I still like it when
0.02%:  I still like it when he'
0.02%:  I'd like to see him solve
0.02%:  I'd like to see him solve this
0.02%:  I've got no idea where the
0.02%:  I've got no idea where the last
0.02%:  what he wrote was '
0.02%:  it's a legend
0.02%:  we gave him this
0.02%:  we gave him this title
0.02%:  it was his dad
0.02%:  he's never said a
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how all
0.05%:  it's kinda weird how all these
0.02%:  I think we've all agreed this was
0.02%:  it's the middle word
0.03%:  it's the middle word that's making
0.02%:  it's the middle word that makes
0.02%:  this was all me
0.02%:  might
0.02%:  might have
0.02%:  that gave me ideas
0.02%:  it's made him the second ever
0.02%:  I will admit this
0.02%:  it gives him that
0.02%:  i have
0.02%:  we wrote this song while
0.02%:  all the kids
0.02%:  that's wrong; it makes
0.02%:  he's dead so it's weird that we call
0.02%:  that's all the work
0.02%:  that's all the work I did
0.02%:  this claim
0.02%:  that's the world we lived in last week as
0.02%:  we've all agreed that his
0.02%:  we've all agreed that his middle
0.02%:  I've no idea who writes these
0.02%:  it's more like what'
0.03%:  it's more like what's called
0.02%:  it's more like what's the
0.02%:  that is the world we'
0.02%:  that's weird how it
0.02%:  wait that rh
0.02%:  there's a long list
0.02%:  that wasn
0.02%:  it's worth 
0.02%:  that might've killed
0.02%:  he did the work in '
0.02%:  this whole idea seems
0.02%:  we think he came
0.02%:  that's wrong; we
0.02%:  he never came
0.02%:  it's not that well
0.02%:  this is all I'm coming
0.02%:  he died 
0.02%:  this is the worse
0.02%:  I've still got work
0.02%:  it's this sem
0.02%:  let's give
0.05%:  let's give him the credit
0.03%:  let's give him credit
0.02%:  let's give him the award
0.02%:  we wrote that while
0.02%:  I think he's racist
0.02%:  I'm a little weird
0.02%:  I wish there was some
0.02%:  I am making that
0.02%:  there's no math
0.02%:  wait;
0.02%:  it's more like he's made this
0.02%:  we've all made this
0.02%:  it's me who's done
0.02%:  we missed
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I'm a
0.02%:  the credit
0.02%:  we'll give him the doctor
0.02%:  this does make him
0.02%:  wait I messed that
0.02%:  it's the world we'd all
0.02%:  he's still alive and he wrote a
0.02%:  it makes him either
0.02%:  I think it's called the '
0.02%:  that's like the worst I
0.02%:  it's a lot less
0.02%:  this doesn't work as well with a
0.02%:  mine was
0.02%:  I think he's more viewed
0.02%:  it's the less
0.02%:  that's three
0.02%:  I did make
0.02%:  what he's done is make
0.02%:  it's more like what he was
0.02%:  I think we might've made it
0.03%:  I think we might've made it worse
0.02%:  we'll give him that second
0.02%:  I'd like to see that movie
0.02%:  that's like the least clever
0.02%:  all he did was give the world
0.02%:  let's get rid
0.02%:  that's wrong; it was
0.02%:  I don't see how we'd get
0.02%:  it's making me sad to write
0.02%:  we're still in the old
0.02%:  it's talked
0.02%:  while we're at it I might as well end
0.02%:  he's old
0.02%:  I'd like him to write
0.02%:  this song came
0.02%:  this song came to me while
0.02%:  I'd love to read
0.02%:  what did he write down
0.02%:  I made his last
0.02%:  it's more like he's a well
0.02%:  this thing
0.02%:  all I know is that he wrote
0.02%:  this is how I write
0.02%:  this is where I'd end
0.02%:  I have no idea what words
0.02%:  while it
0.02%:  it's a little weird how I've made him
0.02%:  there's a line
0.02%:  the last line there'
0.02%:  it's more like the mid
0.02%:  even the
0.02%:  I think it's sem
0.02%:  what I did here
0.02%:  I think it's his dad
0.02%:  it doesn't work as well with the '
0.02%:  their middle
0.02%:  we still have to decide what'
0.02%:  the world we live in makes less
0.02%:  this whole idea's kind
0.02%:  I'll never get this
0.02%:  that's weird I
0.02%:  it's the other kind
0.02%:  I sort
0.02%:  I think that's worse
0.02%:  it's worth making
0.02%:  he did solve
0.02%:  it's more like chaos
0.02%:  I've added these
0.02%:  there's a whole disc
0.02%:  it doesn't cover
0.02%:  it's where he gets
0.02%:  not
0.02%:  it's all we think
0.02%:  what it did is make
0.02%:  we've still got the whole
0.02%:  here I
0.02%:  I think we call those
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad it's over with
0.02%:  that's a little gross
0.02%:  that got
0.19%:  that got weird
0.02%:  I wrote these things
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad this is where we've come
0.02%:  it's the second word that's made
0.02%:  he said he'
0.02%:  he said he'd never
0.02%:  he did work in
0.02%:  that gives me some ideas!!
0.02%:  that's sort
0.02%:  it's what it
0.20%:  it's what it's called when
0.04%:  it's what it's called when we
0.03%:  it's what it's called now
0.02%:  it's what it's called when we talk
0.02%:  this is how I'd
0.02%:  that's what killed me
0.02%:  the world we live in is less awesome
0.02%:  I think it's over
0.02%:  we gave him the last
0.02%:  I'm the other
0.02%:  I'm screw
0.02%:  I think he was more active
0.02%:  I can't get the
0.02%:  as I recall
0.02%:  we're all do
0.02%:  I might have lost
0.02%:  there's still this
0.02%:  he's still alive; I might'
0.02%:  there's like two things I
0.02%:  it's a little weird how I'm the
0.02%:  he never got
0.02%:  that's the worst name
0.02%:  that's the worst name I've come
0.02%:  that was his work
0.02%:  we've made this
0.02%:  he's not dead!!
0.02%:  all this is wrong
0.02%:  this is what I'd like to call
0.02%:  it's all credit
0.02%:  it's not like he's ever
0.02%:  that's a nice
0.02%:  I can't do
0.02%:  all he did is come
0.02%:  this is what I've got
0.02%:  it's the world we live in; I was
0.02%:  that's word
0.02%:  we've all since
0.04%:  we've all since agreed
0.03%:  we've all since agreed that'
0.02%:  we've all since agreed to
0.02%:  he's still awesome
0.02%:  I've kinda messed that
0.02%:  it's making him sort
0.02%:  he's said he
0.06%:  he's said he doesn't like it
0.02%:  we had to remove
0.02%:  there's a giant
0.02%:  now I've said the
0.03%:  now I've said the words
0.02%:  now I've said the word
0.02%:  it's more like he was having
0.02%:  I've heard this song
0.02%:  I've heard this song like
0.02%:  it's their middle
0.02%:  it's their middle names
0.02%:  I've made him the god
0.02%:  I think it was '
0.02%:  when the
0.02%:  I might have made a
0.02%:  we moved
0.02%:  I think it might've said
0.02%:  that's kinda how it'
0.02%:  I'm still doing
0.02%:  we're making the
0.02%:  we call those two
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give him some
0.02%:  I'd take either
0.02%:  we're still having the
0.02%:  I know it
0.04%:  I know it's called
0.02%:  I know it's hard
0.02%:  we tried
0.02%:  it doesn't give
0.07%:  it doesn't give him
0.06%:  it doesn't give him credit
0.02%:  I wrote it in
0.02%:  what he did was more like solve
0.02%:  I'd give the award to the
0.02%:  it's not like he was
0.02%:  that made his sem
0.02%:  here's his
0.02%:  I'd give him the second
0.02%:  he's long
0.02%:  it's more like what he's doing
0.02%:  there was like twelve
0.02%:  he's now called
0.02%:  that's all the time
0.03%:  that's all the time we
0.02%:  I might make this
0.02%:  h
0.02%:  I'd love to see his
0.02%:  it's that last
0.02%:  I like this idea
0.02%:  all he did was re
0.02%:  I don't see what's hard
0.02%:  that's a lie; he's worked
0.02%:  this is making me tired
0.02%:  that's a lie he wrote
0.02%:  it's all made him do
0.02%:  we gave him the award in
0.02%:  we have to change
0.02%:  while we're at it let's give him a medal
0.02%:  the worst
0.02%:  that gives me the
0.02%:  that third line was
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we call them
0.02%:  he wrote his own
0.02%:  it was me who named the
0.02%:  he's dead and it's like
0.02%:  it's what he's called in
0.02%:  the two ideas
0.02%:  the two ideas were
0.02%:  he drew the
0.02%:  what it's made him is give
0.02%:  it's a video game where he
0.02%:  it's the one
0.12%:  it's the one where
0.02%:  it's the one with
0.02%:  give me a second I'll write
0.03%:  give me a second I'll write this
0.02%:  he's like eight
0.02%:  he's died like
0.02%:  he's so
0.02%:  what I did there was commit
0.02%:  what he did was model
0.02%:  this makes me scared
0.02%:  where's this
0.02%:  where's this coming
0.02%:  we did
0.02%:  the world is the
0.02%:  all I know is he's got
0.02%:  this is kinda screw
0.02%:  I've got no idea where that'
0.02%:  what I've said is more
0.02%:  it's got a
0.02%:  I'd like to see them
0.02%:  the title's called
0.02%:  it's so weird that I'm having
0.02%:  it makes him an
0.02%:  I think it's her
0.02%:  it's like the second worst
0.02%:  what we call him
0.02%:  that sem
0.02%:  he's made it
0.02%:  that was the world we lived in 
0.02%:  that's a little weird!!
0.02%:  here's a little
0.02%:  I wrote these while
0.02%:  I kinda wish it were the
0.02%:  he'll get the credit
0.02%:  it's the world I
0.02%:  wait that's kind
0.02%:  it's kinda sweet how we
0.02%:  we need a
0.02%:  there was like this
0.02%:  he might've talked
0.02%:  that's like all wrong
0.02%:  this is a good time
0.02%:  I'd still kinda
0.02%:  what I did was take
0.02%:  it's so sem
0.02%:  there's this kid
0.03%:  there's this kid named
0.02%:  what I've done here is commit
0.02%:  this makes me glad I didn
0.02%:  I called him this
0.02%:  I'd call this
0.02%:  I never said his
0.02%:  he still thinks
0.02%:  it's making me less
0.02%:  I made those things
0.02%:  I'll take this
0.02%:  it's more like he's the son
0.02%:  it's more that we've all
0.02%:  he's either
0.02%:  he's either dead
0.02%:  wait how
0.02%:  wait how did
0.02%:  it was like his
0.02%:  I can't get the rh
0.02%:  the idea came
0.02%:  we can't read
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well save
0.02%:  it's more like what he did was get
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who's sm
0.02%:  the weird
0.02%:  that's kinda rad
0.02%:  I think he's dead so it
0.07%:  I think he's dead so it's weird
0.06%:  I think he's dead so it's more
0.02%:  he's dece
0.02%:  I've called him that like
0.02%:  it's the second where
0.02%:  I was having
0.02%:  this is what I did
0.02%:  where the
0.02%:  we're making him the
0.02%:  I think we've all agreed it's the most
0.02%:  it's kinda how I
0.02%:  we're good with
0.02%:  we're good with that
0.02%:  I'm making the title
0.02%:  he was one
0.02%:  I never saw
0.02%:  he likes his
0.02%:  we all kind
0.02%:  this means we
0.04%:  this means we've
0.02%:  the rest is
0.02%:  what I'm doing there
0.02%:  it's given him some credit
0.02%:  I was making most
0.02%:  it's worse than I
0.02%:  this never gets
0.02%:  all he did was write some the
0.02%:  I like the second
0.02%:  it's more like the middle ages
0.02%:  he was asked to
0.05%:  he was asked to write
0.04%:  he was asked to review
0.02%:  he was asked to write the
0.02%:  he was asked to give
0.02%:  I think we've all made that worse
0.02%:  we've long
0.02%:  I think it's a sem
0.02%:  I've made it worse with
0.02%:  I've made it worse with the
0.02%:  it gave him the name
0.02%:  he's right in
0.02%:  he's over
0.02%:  no idea where that
0.02%:  it's all he did
0.02%:  wait I'm making it worse
0.02%:  it's a short
0.02%:  I don't see how he'd get
0.02%:  I don't see how he'd get credit
0.02%:  this gave me ideas
0.02%:  I've made him this in
0.02%:  it's hard to talk while I
0.22%:  it's hard to talk while I'm eating
0.03%:  it's hard to talk while I'm doing
0.02%:  it's made him that second
0.02%:  we all know it
0.03%:  we all know it's the
0.02%:  he liked ice
0.02%:  it also gave
0.02%:  it's weird that we've all
0.02%:  he's more god
0.02%:  we'll give the award to wh
0.02%:  he's second
0.02%:  him
0.02%:  what I'd like to see is how
0.02%:  I lied the whole time and
0.02%:  what I said there didn
0.02%:  it's weird and
0.02%:  this was the world we lived in 
0.02%:  while we're at it I've come
0.02%:  it's kinda hard to come
0.02%:  I've no idea what he's like as
0.02%:  it's hard to decide what to
0.02%:  what's weird is that I know
0.02%:  it's the world he
0.02%:  while we're at it I'll go
0.02%:  these are all things
0.02%:  it's weird that he's still
0.02%:  this got me
0.02%:  it doesn't work well with the mel
0.02%:  he did it in '
0.02%:  now that we've said it we'll
0.02%:  it was me who was
0.02%:  it also gave him
0.02%:  comes with a side
0.02%:  what he did is solve
0.02%:  I made some slight
0.02%:  while we're at it I've got like
0.02%:  it's more like those
0.02%:  he did write a sem
0.02%:  I'd heard it called
0.02%:  it's not clear who he likes
0.02%:  that was like the worst lim
0.02%:  that's who
0.02%:  that's how we decide
0.02%:  I might've added a
0.03%:  I might've added a little
0.03%:  I might've added a little there
0.02%:  it's dead
0.05%:  it's dead wrong
0.02%:  here's what it
0.03%:  here's what it's like
0.03%:  here's what it's like living
0.02%:  I'm done with the
0.02%:  I've kinda made that
0.02%:  he chose
0.02%:  it was called sem
0.02%:  his work is what made me
0.02%:  his work is what made me decide
0.02%:  it is the world
0.14%:  it is the world we lived
0.02%:  this has all
0.02%:  he died last week with
0.02%:  it's not clear what we'll
0.02%:  I think he also
0.02%:  I might've done
0.02%:  he was more like a middle
0.06%:  he was more like a middle child
0.02%:  he's still alive and goes
0.02%:  he worked with a
0.02%:  that makes sense
0.02%:  I kinda wish there was some
0.02%:  it's making the world awesome
0.02%:  he'd never talk
0.02%:  it's more like when he was twelve
0.02%:  he's lived long
0.02%:  I messed with his
0.02%:  I did most
0.02%:  he's still alive so we can't make
0.02%:  it's taken
0.02%:  which is it
0.02%:  all we know right
0.02%:  I think he draws
0.02%:  it's more like the '
0.02%:  it's more like he gets called
0.02%:  it also gave rise
0.02%:  there's a video with
0.02%:  as I think
0.02%:  where do
0.02%:  we don't write
0.02%:  it's made him win like
0.02%:  what I think we'll do is go
0.02%:  read his
0.02%:  that's all I've got on
0.04%:  that's all I've got on him
0.02%:  I've added in
0.02%:  it has led
0.02%:  I think he made more
0.02%:  I don't see where this
0.02%:  it's still 
0.02%:  that was me who came
0.02%:  I don't have it
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that he's made
0.02%:  the second is the
0.02%:  he's right down
0.02%:  it also makes
0.02%:  it also makes him the
0.02%:  that last rh
0.02%:  it's weird that he called
0.02%:  we're making that last
0.02%:  I never get
0.02%:  I kinda wish that
0.03%:  I kinda wish that were
0.02%:  while we're at it this song
0.02%:  this is the world I'd live
0.02%:  that gave me weird
0.02%:  the title's wrong
0.02%:  that is a lie
0.02%:  the latter makes
0.02%:  I think that's a great
0.02%:  that doesn't work as well as the
0.02%:  we've agreed
0.06%:  we've agreed to call him
0.03%:  we've agreed to call this
0.03%:  we've agreed to call him the
0.03%:  we've agreed that
0.02%:  we've agreed to call him that
0.02%:  we've agreed to call the
0.02%:  I think it's math
0.02%:  it's the world we want
0.02%:  it's more like he's some
0.02%:  it's more like he's what
0.02%:  it's more that the
0.02%:  I've had that wrong
0.02%:  what I did there was kinda
0.02%:  that's more the
0.02%:  we have to get him
0.02%:  I've made him that since like
0.02%:  it's the last word
0.02%:  it's more like I have
0.02%:  it is hard
0.02%:  it's made him a god
0.02%:  it's to
0.02%:  I'm making a list
0.02%:  these are all things I made
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who we
0.02%:  it's hard to tell who we've
0.02%:  all I did was write that
0.02%:  that's what it's called in
0.02%:  I've lost it
0.02%:  I've taken the
0.02%:  it's hard to know what we
0.02%:  it's hard to know what we'd
0.02%:  it's hard to know what we'd call
0.02%:  what I said was wrong
0.02%:  I'd rate his
0.02%:  while I'm doing these
0.02%:  we still don't have a right
0.02%:  what it's made him is kind
0.02%:  now I've said it twice
0.02%:  I'd like to see what the world was
0.02%:  that gives me the cre
0.02%:  it's this word
0.02%:  it's the whole idea
0.02%:  right now he's still
0.02%:  it's like named
0.02%:  we all agreed that'
0.02%:  let's make this
0.02%:  it's a crime to
0.02%:  it's like one word
0.02%:  he'd made
0.02%:  we've had this since
0.02%:  that's kinda weird I
0.02%:  he said that
0.02%:  that is wrong
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that I've got
0.02%:  it's also where the
0.02%:  he died and
0.02%:  this is making me r
0.02%:  I saw this movie
0.02%:  this is what makes
0.02%:  the doctor's name'
0.02%:  we've all kind
0.02%:  I write this while
0.02%:  he's also worked with
0.02%:  I'm doing this over
0.02%:  here's what I'm doing
0.02%:  it's like how
0.02%:  he thinks it
0.02%:  he thinks it's gross
0.02%:  I still like his
0.02%:  it gives him the credit
0.02%:  I can't write like this
0.02%:  what he did is come
0.02%:  it's more like he's a close
0.02%:  we've all gone
0.02%:  we'll have to change it
0.02%:  it makes more
0.02%:  now that I've read his
0.02%:  he doesn't eat
0.02%:  it's the same with or
0.02%:  this is making me sadder
0.02%:  it's like almost
0.02%:  I was doing this
0.02%:  I did write this down
0.02%:  while I've got the
0.02%:  I've tried making
0.02%:  I've tried making this
0.02%:  we think he made
0.02%:  I think it's clever
0.02%:  that line worked
0.02%:  it's more like his dog
0.02%:  that was me who made
0.02%:  this is the world I lived
0.02%:  we all agree it
0.04%:  we all agree it's the
0.05%:  we all agree it's the second
0.02%:  we kind
0.02%:  I take it
0.02%:  we gave him a medal
0.02%:  what I said right
0.02%:  that's like the worst m
0.02%:  I think there'd
0.02%:  we have other
0.02%:  I'll admit it's more
0.02%:  I think he's a god
0.02%:  it was hard to decide
0.02%:  there's this video game I like
0.02%:  there's this video game I like called
0.02%:  it's more like how his
0.02%:  it's more like how his sem
0.02%:  I've messed this whole
0.02%:  while we're at it let's make the
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well know
0.02%:  the name was
0.02%:  we've all agreed we
0.02%:  I like to
0.02%:  he's still alive; he's a
0.02%:  I did that wrong
0.02%:  I've got the words
0.02%:  have I
0.02%:  all I know is that he died
0.02%:  the second verse was
0.02%:  he did this work in
0.02%:  it's more like he's the most
0.02%:  he's the dad
0.02%:  I think this made
0.02%:  it's like the world's gone
0.02%:  it's like the world's gone mad
0.02%:  now I've said that
0.03%:  now I've said that twice
0.02%:  I'm glad we never
0.02%:  I've seen him
0.02%:  doesn
0.03%:  doesn't like
0.03%:  doesn't make
0.05%:  doesn't make him
0.02%:  doesn't he
0.02%:  doesn't he like
0.02%:  I never liked him
0.02%:  we're still doing the
0.02%:  while we're doing this I've
0.02%:  it's making me wish I was still
0.02%:  it's all gone
0.02%:  it was like the other
0.02%:  this is the most tragic
0.02%:  I've made him that; it's not like
0.02%:  it's a hell
0.02%:  I'll admit that's the
0.02%:  I'm having a stroke
0.02%:  I think we messed with
0.02%:  it was more like this
0.02%:  I think he also did
0.02%:  it's worse when
0.02%:  while we're at it I'm still
0.02%:  it's the world we have
0.02%:  it's not a sem
0.02%:  he died last week while
0.02%:  I've had this in
0.02%:  I'd call them
0.02%:  I might've taken some
0.02%:  it makes me wonder what's with
0.02%:  there's a 
0.02%:  I don't get how we
0.08%:  I don't get how we're still
0.34%:  I don't get how we're still alive
0.08%:  I don't get how we're still alive with
0.02%:  how did we get to
0.02%:  it's hard to tell what's even
0.02%:  that's still kind
0.02%:  I'd like to give the last
0.02%:  I've no idea which is more
0.02%:  that seems kind
0.02%:  I'd love to read his
0.02%:  I don't get the
0.02%:  he never asked me
0.02%:  there's a lot I'd
0.02%:  there's a lot I'd change
0.02%:  I made him one
0.02%:  he seems like he
0.02%:  he seems like he'd
0.02%:  I'd like to see what the world'
0.02%:  it was me who wrote the sem
0.02%:  he's still alive I'm not
0.02%:  this doesn't seem like that
0.02%:  I kinda get
0.02%:  that was worse
0.02%:  I wrote this in the
0.02%:  I wrote this in the middle
0.02%:  this made me kind
0.02%:  he seems to have worked
0.02%:  I've taken some
0.02%:  while we're at it can we give
0.02%:  I think he's a good
0.02%:  I think it's real
0.02%:  I've made him these
0.02%:  it's what gave the
0.02%:  he doesn't come
0.02%:  he did that work in
0.02%:  I'd like this song
0.02%:  I think that gives
0.02%:  it's making them
0.02%:  it's weird that I have
0.02%:  I kinda hate this
0.05%:  I kinda hate this world
0.04%:  I kinda hate this world we
0.04%:  I kinda hate this world we'
0.03%:  I kinda hate this world we've
0.02%:  I kinda wish it was the
0.02%:  it's weird how he's not
0.02%:  that's more like what I've
0.02%:  wait that's weird I
0.02%:  it's more like he's a mat
0.02%:  it's kinda great how this
0.02%:  I think we're a
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well kiss
0.02%:  it's hard to call
0.03%:  it's hard to call him
0.02%:  wait I think he was
0.02%:  while we're at it I'm also
0.02%:  that made things worse;
0.02%:  it's later
0.02%:  I wrote some
0.02%:  that was me who said
0.02%:  all those were
0.02%:  that line makes him
0.02%:  I can't get over how well this is
0.02%:  I'd like to hear him sing
0.02%:  I've made him a thing
0.02%:  I've got no idea what their
0.02%:  wait I think he's more well
0.02%:  he's still alive so the
0.02%:  it's the most well
0.02%:  it's what killed
0.02%:  where did that second
0.02%:  that's wrong it
0.07%:  that's wrong it's like
0.03%:  that's wrong it's called
0.03%:  that's wrong it's like the
0.02%:  that's wrong it's called the
0.02%:  the world we live in is what we
0.02%:  he made like
0.02%:  we've all read
0.02%:  it doesn't work with this
0.02%:  we do
0.03%:  we do have
0.02%:  I made the title
0.02%:  I think that was more
0.02%:  his work's still
0.02%:  wow that's a
0.02%:  it was called either
0.02%:  who'
0.02%:  who's that
0.02%:  it's more like he's all
0.02%:  I wrote it when
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how his
0.02%:  it's still a valid
0.02%:  it's weird how well that sc
0.02%:  I'm doing this over email
0.02%:  we've had some
0.02%:  while we're at it we might as well d
0.02%:  that's like his worst
0.02%:  what I'm doing there is called
0.02%:  what I'd like to see is what
0.02%:  I think he is more
0.02%:  I think we mis
0.02%:  that gives him more
0.02%:  I did this all
0.02%:  we all kinda
0.02%:  that makes this
0.02%:  all I'm doing here is mis
0.02%:  that's how it worked
0.02%:  it's kinda a mess
0.02%:  we'll have to write
0.02%:  it's his work that's done
0.02%:  I think most
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like he has
0.02%:  he's not that well
0.02%:  it's hard to decide what's most
0.02%:  it's like having
0.02%:  we think he's a
0.02%:  I kinda wish we lived there
0.02%:  the whole time I'
0.02%:  that's like the worst idea I've come
0.02%:  all he did was think
0.02%:  he's still alive; he's doing
0.02%:  I kinda miss
0.02%:  I kinda miss the old world
0.02%:  he's still alive; I wrote
0.02%:  that's what we'
0.02%:  I think he was secret
0.02%:  it's 'the
0.02%:  the latter's his
0.02%:  it's all kinda the
0.02%:  that's his w
0.02%:  we're all kinda glad
0.02%:  he's still alive and he's 
0.02%:  I can't get the words
0.02%:  wait how did we
0.02%:  wait how did we get there
0.02%:  it's the worst song
0.02%:  he's still alive and he did
0.02%:  wow this might
0.02%:  man I've
0.02%:  what he did was write it
0.02%:  what's it
0.06%:  what's it called when
0.05%:  what's it like
0.04%:  what's it like having
0.03%:  what's it like living
0.02%:  what's it like to live
0.02%:  it's not clear what he liked
0.02%:  all I've done is made
0.02%:  it was him who gave
0.02%:  it was him who gave me
0.02%:  I did this while
0.02%:  I did like
0.02%:  she wrote it while
0.02%:  it's more like he's said
0.02%:  what I've said here does
0.02%:  he's dead now so it
0.06%:  he's dead now so it's weird
0.06%:  he's dead now so it's weird that
0.03%:  he's dead now so it's weird that we
0.03%:  he's dead now so it's weird that we call
0.02%:  he's dead now so it's like
0.02%:  he's dead and his
0.02%:  he's dead and his work
0.02%:  we have to write
0.02%:  I don't agree
0.16%:  I don't agree with his
0.13%:  I don't agree with this
0.11%:  I don't agree with his views
0.10%:  I don't agree with the
0.07%:  I don't agree with him
0.02%:  I don't agree with his sem
0.02%:  I don't agree with the last
0.02%:  I don't agree with what
0.02%:  I don't agree with his view
0.02%:  I don't agree with this last
0.02%:  wait his
0.02%:  it's where he comes
0.02%:  he'd have
0.02%:  let's stick with him
0.02%:  that's how I know
0.02%:  I did write that down
0.02%:  that's all I've got lined
0.02%:  I added some
0.02%:  since we're all dead
0.02%:  he calls the
0.02%:  kinda
0.02%:  it's all we're doing
0.02%:  I've looked this
0.02%:  this all makes me wonder
0.02%:  it's more like he's given a lot
0.02%:  there's two things called
0.02%:  now that we've agreed
0.02%:  this is all I've come here
0.02%:  that's all I did
0.02%:  that's where we live
0.02%:  it's more that he died
0.02%:  this is weird and
0.02%:  I wrote that in like
0.02%:  I've said this whole time wrong
0.02%:  wait I wrote
0.02%:  I made those last three
0.02%:  that's weird; I think
0.02%:  I'm wrong; he
0.02%:  I think we're mess
0.02%:  the whole title
0.02%:  the whole title was
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad we're all
0.02%:  I made him think
0.02%:  it's more like a mid
0.02%:  it will make
0.02%:  other
0.02%:  said
0.02%:  while we're at it I've named
0.02%:  I've made him look
0.02%:  it's still the world we'd
0.02%:  where did he get
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in last sem
0.02%:  it's a little weird how close
0.02%:  I swear this is the
0.02%:  that's all the time I'
0.02%:  it's like I said
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like there
0.06%:  it doesn't seem like there's a whole
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like there was
0.02%:  this verse is called
0.02%:  I think there's a law
0.02%:  he thinks it's more
0.02%:  he's still alive so it's weird he
0.02%:  I think we're all gods
0.02%:  I think he gives
0.02%:  I think he gives credit
0.02%:  that line works
0.02%:  we'd call it
0.02%:  that's more like eight
0.02%:  it's a lot worse
0.02%:  in 
0.02%:  it has given him like
0.02%:  he never did get
0.02%:  we call him this
0.02%:  I have no idea how we
0.02%:  I have no idea how we'
0.02%:  I have no idea how we're still
0.02%:  it's more like he has given
0.02%:  we're doing well
0.02%:  we've called the whole
0.02%:  that's more like a middle
0.11%:  that's more like a middle child
0.02%:  I think we're still alive
0.02%:  I'll never admit
0.02%:  that's the sem
0.02%:  it's still the same thing
0.02%:  it's not clear how he'd
0.02%:  he's still alive; he worked at
0.02%:  it's like that whole
0.02%:  this ended
0.02%:  he's still alive so he gets mad
0.02%:  it's a little weird how we've gone
0.02%:  it's right down the
0.02%:  it's still like the
0.02%:  I've got him
0.02%:  I'll give him the award
0.02%:  I like this new world we've made!!
0.02%:  I wanted him
0.02%:  it's real good
0.02%:  he's not listed
0.02%:  it's more like he's viewed as the god
0.02%:  what it's done is made him like
0.02%:  that verse was
0.02%:  it made him the world's oldest alive
0.02%:  I'll wait
0.02%:  it's more like he gave some
0.02%:  I don't get it
0.02%:  the world we live in is what we make
0.02%:  I kinda made all
0.02%:  in this case
0.02%:  it's got more
0.02%:  these are things
0.02%:  I'll admit that was
0.02%:  we've all since agreed that the
0.02%:  it's still over
0.02%:  I'd like the world
0.02%:  there's like two things I'
0.02%:  I know it's called the
0.02%:  well
0.02%:  this was a weird
0.02%:  he died last week; he
0.02%:  he died last week; I
0.02%:  I made this thing
0.02%:  it's also made him the world
0.02%:  it's a new word
0.02%:  I've made him that one
0.02%:  I'd love to see him write
0.02%:  it's more like he's made all
0.02%:  there's still two
0.02%:  it was more like twelve
0.02%:  I don't work
0.02%:  it's still the same words
0.02%:  I've no idea what it
0.06%:  I've no idea what it's called
0.03%:  I've no idea what it's like!!
0.02%:  I'd love to hear his sem
0.02%:  wait this doesn't seem right I
0.02%:  wait this doesn't seem right I've
0.02%:  he had a
0.02%:  I still like cheese
0.02%:  it gives me the
0.02%:  this still
0.02%:  here's the link
0.02%:  writes
0.02%:  I wrote that while we waited
0.02%:  I've read it and
0.02%:  that's clever
0.02%:  it doesn't matter
1.01%:  it doesn't matter which
0.14%:  it doesn't matter which we
0.17%:  it doesn't matter which we'
0.11%:  it doesn't matter which is
0.05%:  it doesn't matter which side
0.03%:  it doesn't matter which was
0.03%:  it doesn't matter which we've
0.02%:  it doesn't matter which I
0.03%:  it doesn't matter which I'
0.02%:  it doesn't matter which sem
0.02%:  it doesn't matter who
0.02%:  it doesn't matter how
0.02%:  it doesn't matter how well
0.02%:  it's less clear
0.02%:  that's where it all comes
0.02%:  that's made me sick
0.02%:  I think we call these
0.02%:  it was more a
0.02%:  that's the entire
0.02%:  I've heard he was
0.02%:  that third line makes
0.02%:  that's like the cr
0.02%:  what he did was more like sem
0.02%:  there's no 'the
0.02%:  I've no idea what words
0.02%:  I like this new tim
0.02%:  I've kinda messed this whole
0.02%:  it's the world we live in that's sem
0.02%:  all he did was review
0.02%:  all he did was review some
0.02%:  he doesn't get called either
0.02%:  this is how I've come
0.02%:  I can't give
0.02%:  he still gets credit
0.02%:  it's more like he's had a lot
0.02%:  it's made him two
0.02%:  since it
0.02%:  it's called the other
0.02%:  he was called that
0.02%:  I'm glad this is over with
0.02%:  I'd never call him a
0.02%:  I've still got like three
0.02%:  I might've missed a word in the
0.02%:  he's coming over this
0.02%:  he's coming over this week
0.02%:  what I did is
0.02%:  these are all things I'
0.02%:  I'm kinda reg
0.02%:  we all love
0.02%:  I might have done
0.02%:  that's the world I lived
0.02%:  he's more like the middle aged
0.02%:  I've tried this
0.02%:  it's still his
0.02%:  it's still his sem
0.02%:  it's more like he's listed
0.02%:  it's now 
0.02%:  I'm glad we solved that
0.02%:  it's more like he made it
0.02%:  that's a new
0.02%:  I liked his other
0.02%:  he had like
0.02%:  it's a lie;
0.02%:  I said this
0.02%:  it's more like he named his
0.02%:  it's more that he didn
0.02%:  this is like the least
0.02%:  it's a weird thing to have
0.02%:  it's more like his most
0.02%:  no it was
0.02%:  he's asked
0.02%:  it's more like he lives
0.02%:  he also likes
0.02%:  what I did there was sm
0.02%:  this will make more
0.02%:  I'll admit this was the
0.02%:  she's more like the
0.02%:  while we're doing this let's add
0.02%:  this whole time I've made
0.02%:  it's all he writes
0.02%:  I think he's tried
0.02%:  it's given him this
0.02%:  it's more what he said
0.02%:  it's like the worst song I
0.02%:  it's more like a c
0.02%:  it's a three
0.02%:  don't tell
0.02%:  I'm wrong; he's the
0.01%:  it's like the worst thing I've said all decade
0.01%:  all I did was watch
0.01%:  he's still alive and there's two
0.01%:  that's like the worst movie
0.01%:  that makes more sense with
0.01%:  this is the world we still
0.01%:  I've read his thesis
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how the
0.01%:  let's go with that
0.01%:  I've had this weird
0.01%:  it's when he was twelve
0.01%:  now that I've said it's weird
0.01%:  I am making these
0.02%:  I am making these words
0.01%:  I'd never said
0.01%:  it's not clear what he'd
0.01%:  it's what it's called when we write
0.01%:  the same thing
0.01%:  it was math
0.01%:  I'd heard it was his
0.01%:  that's like his real
0.01%:  it's like a thing where we
0.01%:  I've got no idea what he's like;
0.01%:  that's all he's ever talked
0.01%:  it's dated
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in ages
0.01%:  this is all I did
0.01%:  it's more like what I'
0.01%:  since there
0.01%:  this isn't hard
0.01%:  it doesn't work that well as a lim
0.01%:  the god
0.01%:  I made that shit
0.01%:  I think we've made him a
0.01%:  the word in
0.02%:  the word in the middle
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd called
0.02%:  it's making me wish we'd called the
0.01%:  all I ever
0.02%:  all I ever did
0.01%:  that's a lie; he worked
0.01%:  I added all
0.01%:  I might have killed
0.01%:  I've read this like
0.02%:  I've read this like twice
0.02%:  I've read this like twice now
0.01%:  it made him kind
0.01%:  I'll get
0.01%:  we're making the whole
0.01%:  it's what he did to
0.01%:  I lied a
0.01%:  that's like the worst dad
0.01%:  it's more like he's two
0.01%:  it's called the hal
0.01%:  he wrote it while sick
0.01%:  in real
0.01%:  this is the worst we've talked
0.01%:  I wrote all that while
0.01%:  I'm wrong this
0.01%:  this might not
0.01%:  don't ask
0.05%:  don't ask me how
0.04%:  don't ask me where
0.02%:  don't ask me what
0.02%:  don't ask me where this
0.02%:  don't ask me where this came
0.02%:  don't ask me where I got this
0.02%:  don't ask him
0.02%:  don't ask me where this is
0.01%:  this is all I'm doing here
0.01%:  his grand
0.01%:  that's more his
0.01%:  I lied and he
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like with
0.01%:  I think he still goes
0.01%:  I was making the word
0.01%:  wait this whole time
0.02%:  wait this whole time I was
0.01%:  all I did was change like
0.02%:  all I did was change like three
0.01%:  that's more like the middle
0.01%:  I think he gets more
0.01%:  did I
0.01%:  I don't see how it
0.02%:  I don't see how it's made
0.02%:  I don't see how it's ever
0.01%:  I don't see how it makes
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk; it
0.01%:  it doesn't have to
0.01%:  this is the weak
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in at
0.01%:  this new world makes me sad
0.01%:  it's more like he gives
0.01%:  what he did was more like set
0.01%:  I've chosen
0.01%:  I've made them all
0.01%:  that's a slight
0.01%:  I can't read the
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I made
0.01%:  I'd like to meet
0.01%:  can we get
0.01%:  I think he did write
0.01%:  what he's done is write
0.01%:  this is a cover
0.01%:  I'm adding that
0.01%:  that's like two
0.01%:  he's said to have worked
0.01%:  it's more like a 
0.01%:  it's weird how all those
0.01%:  I kinda get where
0.02%:  I kinda get where he was
0.01%:  he's still alive and made
0.01%:  I don't care what he likes;
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's great
0.01%:  we think it's the
0.01%:  I lied; he's more like
0.01%:  while we're at it let's make this
0.01%:  all he did was write down that
0.01%:  it was like eight words
0.01%:  I'd never made
0.02%:  I'd never made the
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we don't like to
0.01%:  all he asked
0.01%:  this isn't how I
0.01%:  I think we might still
0.01%:  I think we've said too
0.01%:  the thing'
0.03%:  the thing's called
0.01%:  it's drawn
0.01%:  it's a dish
0.03%:  it's a dish made
0.05%:  it's a dish made with
0.02%:  it's a dish made with gr
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he was the
0.01%:  I've got all this
0.01%:  I'm still scared
0.01%:  it's hard to tell his
0.01%:  it's more like a h
0.01%:  we don't get
0.01%:  we like him
0.01%:  I lied; that
0.02%:  I lied; that's the
0.01%:  I lied; that was
0.01%:  this does make me wish I'd gone
0.01%:  what I've said there makes little
0.01%:  he's still alive and might read
0.01%:  it's more like named
0.01%:  the second is more
0.01%:  the whole idea's kinda
0.01%:  what I've done there is made
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like his
0.01%:  all I did was go
0.01%:  I've named him
0.01%:  it's weird that I'm doing all
0.02%:  it's weird that I'm doing all these
0.02%:  it's weird that I'm doing all the
0.01%:  we don't call them '
0.01%:  almost
0.01%:  that's this week
0.01%:  we've had like three
0.01%:  I still like it when he gives
0.01%:  I added the last verse
0.01%:  I heard he'
0.01%:  it's weird how well those
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird I
0.01%:  I read some
0.01%:  that's a lie; he never
0.01%:  that's all I've got; it
0.01%:  his real name was
0.01%:  we don't give him the
0.01%:  this whole time we're
0.01%:  there's no god
0.01%:  he's still alive so I don
0.01%:  he looked
0.01%:  he's still alive and he wrote me
0.01%:  when I get
0.01%:  I can't do this
0.01%:  that's now the world we'
0.02%:  that's now the world we've
0.01%:  we're a long
0.01%:  I don't recall how we
0.01%:  it's the answer
0.01%:  it's like he's one
0.01%:  he's got a whole
0.01%:  while we're at it I have some
0.01%:  wait I'm making this worse with
0.01%:  it's more like two things
0.01%:  it's made him that;
0.01%:  all I did was come
0.01%:  that's called a
0.01%:  this line makes
0.01%:  we're doing it all
0.01%:  this seems to
0.02%:  this seems to have worked
0.01%:  it made him like the
0.01%:  it was like the 
0.01%:  now that I read
0.01%:  I'm still having some
0.01%:  doesn't make him either
0.01%:  I can't read his
0.01%:  it's all math
0.01%:  I think those words
0.01%:  we'll change
0.01%:  it's worth like two
0.01%:  he died this week at
0.01%:  he doesn't ever
0.01%:  I'd still like that
0.01%:  I'm making these rh
0.01%:  it's made him get awards
0.01%:  it's like these
0.01%:  it's making me wish this were
0.01%:  that last line made me sick
0.01%:  that's not the
0.01%:  wait where'd that
0.04%:  wait where'd that come
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've called
0.02%:  it's kinda weird that we've called the
0.01%:  his work was done with
0.01%:  it's more like a met
0.01%:  he made me
0.03%:  he made me write
0.07%:  he made me write this
0.03%:  he made me write this down
0.01%:  he never said he did
0.01%:  he won't like this
0.01%:  wait there's so
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he did
0.01%:  it was me who wrote his
0.01%:  let's all go
0.01%:  when did I
0.01%:  I'll have to write this
0.01%:  it's kinda how we
0.01%:  I'm making those last two rh
0.01%:  it's made him other
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've got a whole
0.01%:  I'd love to hear him sing
0.01%:  those are all
0.01%:  it's kinda tragic how he
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd never said
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work!!
0.01%:  it's all I've said
0.01%:  he called it a
0.01%:  that's all he ever
0.01%:  I think we might've all
0.01%:  it gave him some credit
0.01%:  I've made him do
0.01%:  that's like what
0.01%:  what he did was set
0.01%:  it made him what we
0.01%:  what I'd like to do is get
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in while we
0.01%:  I'm glad we've talked
0.01%:  he's in charge
0.01%:  I might need a
0.01%:  it's great how
0.01%:  that was when
0.01%:  all the credit is
0.01%:  I think it's good
0.01%:  where did I go with
0.01%:  I think he said it's more
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child;
0.01%:  we'll give him his
0.02%:  we'll give him his doctor
0.02%:  we'll give him his own award
0.01%:  I think we've said this
0.01%:  there was like eight
0.01%:  we'll give him the award and
0.01%:  it's made them
0.01%:  we've all agreed to stick
0.17%:  we've all agreed to stick with the
0.04%:  we've all agreed to stick with the old
0.02%:  we've all agreed to stick with the name
0.02%:  we've all agreed to stick with his
0.01%:  he died last week and his
0.01%:  this makes me wonder what'
0.01%:  I think we've missed a word
0.01%:  that's all I've got; the
0.01%:  this movie
0.01%:  I think it's mis
0.01%:  it's that other
0.01%:  I made the name
0.01%:  it's called things with
0.01%:  I wrote this like 
0.01%:  it's his middle name!!
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd had
0.01%:  I'd give that
0.01%:  I made this word
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever get a
0.01%:  that last line made me throw
0.01%:  it's kinda weird we
0.01%:  we don't give him the credit
0.01%:  it made him world
0.01%:  I'm in
0.01%:  it's the '
0.01%:  it made him write
0.01%:  that line's weird
0.01%:  he did that like
0.01%:  I think he's less
0.01%:  he's never said he liked it
0.01%:  it's less clever
0.01%:  it's hard to get him
0.01%:  I'd read the whole
0.01%:  all I did here was switch
0.01%:  I made the whole '
0.01%:  the two were
0.01%:  it's made him the origin
0.01%:  he still likes it
0.01%:  how do
0.01%:  it's more like the class
0.01%:  let's stick with the word
0.01%:  I don't see how we've made
0.02%:  I don't see how we've made this
0.01%:  he still does
0.01%:  I've heard that'
0.01%:  I'm still kinda mad
0.01%:  I said that twice
0.01%:  I'm kinda scared to
0.01%:  it's still good
0.01%:  he's worked a
0.02%:  he's worked a lot with
0.01%:  that's like the worst all
0.01%:  it's a thing where we
0.01%:  it's making me wish there
0.01%:  I don't like this whole
0.01%:  it's the other sem
0.01%:  wait I've made this
0.01%:  he cares
0.01%:  that is the world we live in; I'
0.02%:  that is the world we live in; I'm glad
0.04%:  that is the world we live in; I'm glad we'
0.01%:  I don't agree with how
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how he
0.01%:  that seems weird now
0.01%:  I think we're all his
0.01%:  that's still like
0.01%:  we're still asking him to
0.01%:  it's more like he calls
0.01%:  I think what we've got
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd still
0.01%:  what I said there was kind
0.01%:  let's call the
0.01%:  he wrote like
0.01%:  this is the c
0.01%:  no it's weird
0.01%:  I made all the
0.02%:  I made all the words
0.01%:  we call him the grand
0.01%:  I had to write this
0.01%:  there is like
0.01%:  he gave a
0.01%:  it's kinda che
0.01%:  the idea was
0.01%:  this idea came
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he got
0.01%:  that's wrong; he'd
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like right
0.01%:  he's still alive and works with me!!
0.01%:  the doctor's name was
0.01%:  it's what we call it
0.01%:  it makes him the origin
0.01%:  it doesn't read
0.03%:  it doesn't read well
0.01%:  it doesn't read like
0.01%:  I'd call him a
0.01%:  I think we missed the real
0.01%:  I think he covers
0.01%:  we've got to
0.01%:  having him
0.01%:  it's this last
0.01%:  this idea came to me while
0.01%:  this made me write a song
0.01%:  what I've said there is a
0.01%:  I still have like
0.01%:  all that's right
0.01%:  it was more like he solved
0.01%:  now that we've made the
0.01%:  I might've made those last words
0.01%:  I'd like to have the word
0.01%:  it's hard to get the
0.01%:  the world we live in does
0.01%:  I'm making that last word
0.01%:  wait I think this
0.01%:  wow that's like
0.04%:  wow that's like the worst
0.01%:  he was the origin
0.01%:  that's how I write
0.01%:  that's kinda mis
0.01%:  that's not a
0.01%:  his work was all
0.01%:  I had a
0.03%:  I had a stroke
0.16%:  I had a stroke while
0.02%:  I had a stroke while coming
0.01%:  it's weird how he's listed
0.01%:  what was I
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell who's made
0.01%:  it's like the single
0.01%:  all I did was get
0.01%:  the last time
0.01%:  we've all heard this
0.01%:  he thinks it's called
0.01%:  it's this week's cover
0.01%:  I'd like to change that
0.01%:  I'm making the doctor
0.01%:  that's god
0.01%:  all he ever
0.03%:  all he ever did
0.06%:  all he ever did was come
0.01%:  I don't recall who
0.01%:  he's dead and I
0.01%:  that's how I'd write
0.01%:  I added all the
0.01%:  I think he's made it more
0.01%:  wait a sec I
0.01%:  this seems like the wrong
0.01%:  it's more god
0.01%:  all he did was write down the most
0.01%:  it doesn't make him well
0.01%:  I think we might've made a
0.01%:  it's not clear how this
0.01%:  all he talked
0.01%:  I wish he was
0.01%:  it never gets
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give them
0.01%:  I think this was more
0.01%:  it seems his
0.01%:  all I did was write these things
0.01%:  that's kinda great
0.01%:  that's a lie; he's like
0.01%:  he's still alive and has
0.03%:  he's still alive and has worked
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well that sc
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like
0.01%:  that's all I'm doing here is
0.01%:  the world we live in is made
0.01%:  it's a sweet
0.01%:  it made him the world's oldest active
0.01%:  I made that one
0.01%:  it's made him the 
0.01%:  the world's still
0.01%:  we still have like three
0.01%:  this is all I've said
0.01%:  while we're all
0.01%:  that's not how we
0.01%:  the world is still the same;
0.02%:  the world is still the same; I'
0.02%:  the world is still the same; I've
0.01%:  he's alive and he's still
0.01%:  I said the word
0.01%:  these are like
0.01%:  that doesn't make a
0.02%:  that doesn't make a whole
0.01%:  we have it
0.01%:  that's a little mis
0.01%:  I've no idea what their
0.01%:  it's the other vice
0.01%:  this is making more
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to see
0.01%:  I was making them
0.01%:  it's kinda the world
0.32%:  it's kinda the world we lived
0.01%:  these things are called
0.01%:  the movie is
0.05%:  the movie is called
0.01%:  I don't see how we're all
0.01%:  it's more that he's called
0.01%:  it's more like we have
0.01%:  he's that
0.01%:  that's a lie; I'm making this
0.01%:  I've taken this
0.01%:  I think we've all made it clear
0.01%:  this is the same
0.01%:  it's weird that he was called
0.01%:  we're taking the
0.01%:  we don't call him like
0.01%:  I can't tell where
0.01%:  I think we'll have to come
0.01%:  I'm still living
0.01%:  all these things
0.01%:  that's the world we live in; we
0.01%:  we've still got that
0.01%:  I think this verse
0.01%:  it's still the world we've
0.01%:  he had to
0.01%:  that's where I've gone
0.01%:  I'll admit right
0.01%:  no wait he
0.01%:  I see what
0.01%:  it was their
0.01%:  I like them
0.01%:  he's died twice now
0.01%:  it's while
0.01%:  he wrote it with a
0.01%:  I like it with
0.06%:  I like it with cheese
0.01%:  it'll never
0.01%:  this was a review
0.01%:  it's still me who gets
0.02%:  it's still me who gets credit
0.01%:  wait he's the
0.01%:  this whole time I've kind
0.01%:  I think it's more that
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like a real
0.01%:  that's like the worst sim
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved this whole
0.01%:  this is so weird I
0.01%:  no wait that's like
0.01%:  it doesn't work with a
0.01%:  I'm sad
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's new
0.01%:  wait this makes him
0.01%:  we call him like
0.01%:  the second makes
0.01%:  this has made me weird
0.01%:  we're still having some
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he was
0.01%:  it made him either
0.01%:  wait who
0.01%:  this is a secret
0.01%:  he's given talks
0.01%:  he's given talks with
0.01%:  I might have made it all
0.01%:  wow this is the
0.01%:  that was making
0.01%:  it can
0.02%:  it can'
0.01%:  it's all the same words with
0.01%:  I'm glad we're done
0.10%:  I'm glad we're done with that
0.06%:  I'm glad we're done with this talk
0.04%:  I'm glad we're done with this little
0.02%:  I'm glad we're done with the
0.01%:  he did it all
0.01%:  I think that's a clever
0.01%:  that's wrong; he died like
0.01%:  that's where I come
0.01%:  that makes me cringe with
0.01%:  he worked at the
0.01%:  I wish it had
0.02%:  I wish it had made
0.01%:  this is where we've
0.01%:  this is where we've ended
0.01%:  I don't get how we're all
0.01%:  he's given his
0.01%:  given what
0.01%:  I think we've got the
0.01%:  I don't see him here
0.01%:  it's less a
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's kinda
0.01%:  the met
0.01%:  where's that
0.01%:  sir I think
0.01%:  this is gross
0.01%:  I'd like to see how well
0.01%: ; he
0.01%:  he's dead so we
0.01%:  we can't solve
0.01%:  what I said there made
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's a
0.01%:  wait he's still alive I
0.01%:  I'll admit it was
0.01%:  the world we live in is that I'm a
0.01%:  this track
0.01%:  let's strike
0.01%:  what he did in
0.01%:  I can't wait
0.01%:  it's where he gave
0.01%:  that's making his
0.01%:  he doesn't like math
0.01%:  it doesn't work with him
0.01%:  I was there
0.01%:  I've made it the
0.01%:  this is what I've done
0.01%:  we might as
0.03%:  we might as well throw
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he calls
0.01%:  what did he even
0.03%:  what did he even write
0.01%:  there he
0.03%:  there he's called
0.01%:  this idea'
0.01%:  that's kinda where we
0.01%:  the last line might
0.01%:  there's like a good
0.01%:  it's not clear how he died
0.01%:  it's all he ever wanted
0.01%:  it's like a real
0.03%:  it's like a real thing
0.01%:  that was like the world
0.03%:  that was like the world we
0.09%:  that was like the world we live
0.01%:  he's on
0.01%:  it's where he was
0.01%:  this is all wrong I've made
0.01%:  I've had this entire
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give the same
0.01%:  he was given credit
0.01%:  don't read it
0.01%:  I'd heard it was called the
0.01%:  it's like what he
0.01%:  that's kinda tragic
0.01%:  it seems like his
0.01%:  I kinda wish he was
0.01%:  he did work with
0.01%:  we've added
0.02%:  we've added the
0.02%:  we've added that
0.01%:  it's like the last
0.01%:  that's their middle names
0.01%:  I've got no idea where this was
0.01%:  it's a thing he wrote called
0.01%:  he said it's more
0.01%:  that review
0.01%:  it's a cool
0.01%:  I've seen this
0.01%:  we've got that
0.01%:  when did he
0.02%:  when did he write
0.01%:  it's signed
0.01%:  we might have to come
0.01%:  it was his other sem
0.01%:  the math was
0.01%:  it's not clear what he'd like
0.01%:  that's nice
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's a
0.01%:  he wrote this down
0.01%:  that doesn't have
0.01%:  I think he's scared
0.01%:  where's the
0.01%:  it all comes
0.01%:  which is more like
0.01%:  it's not worth
0.01%:  wait he's more
0.01%:  all I did was write down what
0.01%:  I think we're well
0.01%:  the head
0.01%:  it's like this song
0.01%:  it's like this song where
0.01%:  I think we've got some
0.01%:  it's a 
0.01%:  I think he'd made
0.01%:  he missed the word
0.01%:  he did a whole
0.01%:  it seems like he's called
0.01%:  this is the second time I've made a
0.01%:  I wish he'd write
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he's still
0.01%:  I've lied to
0.01%:  that's wrong; it's made
0.01%:  wait is
0.01%:  let's stick with math
0.01%:  that song
0.01%:  that's the single
0.01%:  it's a term we
0.01%:  it's like what I
0.01%:  I wrote that while we talked
0.01%:  we call those d
0.01%:  this is making me star
0.01%:  what it's made him is older
0.01%:  it was the mid
0.01%:  that's wrong it's the
0.01%:  it's made him the grand
0.01%:  it's more like he's the mid
0.01%:  his name is right
0.01%:  all credit goes to him
0.01%:  now that we've worked
0.01%:  that's more how
0.01%:  I think we'll give that
0.01%:  it made him do
0.01%:  this is where we come
0.01%:  it made him win the 
0.01%:  he's still got
0.01%:  those are his
0.03%:  those are his middle
0.01%:  this seems like the worst idea I
0.02%:  this seems like the worst idea I've come
0.01%:  I think we're called
0.01%:  that's where it goes
0.01%:  that's the world'
0.01%:  it's more like the two have
0.01%:  we threw
0.01%:  I'm still more
0.01%:  he's a white
0.01%:  I know his
0.01%:  it's having
0.01%:  making him
0.01%:  the lack
0.01%:  I think we might've called
0.01%:  it's more like it
0.09%:  it's more like it's made
0.02%:  it's more like it's given
0.01%:  that's a lie the
0.01%:  I've now made
0.01%:  it made him think
0.01%:  he also did other
0.01%:  I'm still asking
0.01%:  it's a little weird he named
0.01%:  here's the deal
0.01%:  he's still alive right now;
0.01%:  I think we've all mis
0.01%:  I wrote this on
0.01%:  that's the words
0.01%:  he kinda gets
0.02%:  he kinda gets credit
0.01%:  I don't see how he ever
0.01%:  there's all this
0.01%:  it is worth
0.01%:  I've kinda made this
0.01%:  he did it when
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; we had
0.01%:  I think it's the world we'd
0.01%:  we think he wrote
0.01%:  he's still making sem
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's not dead
0.01%:  I've made him a lot
0.01%:  what I'm doing is read the
0.01%:  I can see how
0.01%:  we've made him a
0.01%:  I think we've still
0.01%:  it is named
0.01%:  it's less clear who
0.01%:  ever since I'
0.01%:  that's a lie I'
0.11%:  that's a lie I'm making
0.01%:  it's weird having
0.01%:  this is taking
0.01%:  he's still alive and he writes me
0.01%:  it's given him the title
0.01%:  right now he's still alive
0.01%:  the other is
0.01%:  it was this week
0.01%:  in this world we call
0.01%:  he's died like three
0.01%:  he's died like three times now
0.01%:  while we're making
0.01%:  this is what I'm like
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's listed
0.01%:  wait he wrote
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is make
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he gets
0.05%:  it's kinda weird he gets called
0.01%:  I kinda messed with his
0.01%:  it's hard to talk when
0.01%:  even I'm sick
0.01%:  I have this weird image
0.01%:  I know the
0.01%:  I might've m
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is how
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is how we
0.01%:  it was more like when
0.01%:  I might've added in
0.01%:  I can't make this rh
0.01%:  I still think he was
0.01%:  it's the latter while
0.01%:  I write like
0.01%:  he's listed as the
0.01%:  I am the
0.01%:  all I've done here is make
0.01%:  it's the latter I've
0.01%:  when I write these
0.01%:  he's had more
0.01%:  it doesn't have the same
0.01%:  we've all lost
0.01%:  it's called worst
0.01%:  he kinda died
0.01%:  I think he'd more
0.01%:  I'll have to get
0.01%:  it's hard to make these
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's still some
0.01%:  what's weird is that I'm doing
0.01%:  what's weird is I think
0.01%:  what it's done is make me wish
0.01%:  this does make me sad
0.01%:  it's not clear we
0.02%:  it's not clear we'
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd tried
0.01%:  wait there's a lot
0.01%:  he died this week and I
0.01%:  he died this week and I'
0.01%:  I'd like to see the world with
0.01%:  I'm having a weird
0.01%:  it's the other dad
0.01%:  I'd write this
0.01%:  I'd give him the latter
0.01%:  his entire
0.01%:  he never said it was
0.01%:  he's dead so I'
0.01%:  it was like seven
0.01%:  it's hard to decide whose
0.01%:  I have to go write
0.01%:  it's the main
0.01%:  I still don't get what
0.02%:  I still don't get what'
0.01%:  I still don't get what's so hard
0.01%:  that got weird when
0.01%:  there's like a video game called this
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's a
0.01%:  while we're at it his
0.01%:  we've added the last
0.01%:  I think that was called
0.01%:  that's all I've got to
0.01%:  wait I don't like
0.01%:  let's leave him
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as it might
0.01%:  we've had it
0.49%:  we've had it wrong all this time;
0.19%:  we've had it wrong all this time!!
0.17%:  we've had it wrong this
0.10%:  we've had it wrong all these
0.07%:  we've had it wrong all this time; we
0.06%:  we've had it wrong all this time; it
0.05%:  we've had it wrong all this time; we'
0.04%:  we've had it wrong the
0.02%:  we've had it wrong all this time; I
0.03%:  we've had it wrong all this time; I'
0.01%:  he got his idea
0.01%:  it's like the second or
0.01%:  what I'd like to see solved is where
0.01%:  I think there's a limit
0.01%:  I'd like to am
0.01%:  that's the second time
0.06%:  that's the second time I've made
0.02%:  that's the second time I've mis
0.01%:  I lied it's the worst
0.01%:  it's like the second hard
0.01%:  it's all come
0.01%:  I think it's the sem
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's dead now
0.01%:  he died long
0.01%:  it's all I ever wanted
0.01%:  we had that
0.01%:  what I'm doing is c
0.01%:  isn
0.01%:  this is what I was doing
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong this
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's at
0.01%:  what I'm more
0.01%:  there's like seven d
0.01%:  it's the latter case
0.01%:  that's what I called
0.01%:  that's how we came
0.01%:  there's a video game I
0.01%:  that does make
0.03%:  that does make him
0.01%:  we call that work
0.01%:  this is the world we've long
0.01%:  all I wrote
0.01%:  it also made him get
0.01%:  he was given his
0.01%:  it's weird that he gets
0.05%:  it's weird that he gets called
0.01%:  it's kinda great how he
0.01%:  with all
0.02%:  with all these
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well as a lim
0.01%:  we've called the latter
0.01%:  it's a game
0.01%:  it's a game where
0.01%:  it's a crime that
0.01%:  it will make him the
0.01%:  I was making him
0.01%:  it's all the same work
0.01%:  I've kinda lost where
0.01%:  this is almost
0.01%:  all I know is he died
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to get him
0.01%:  he's alive and he wrote
0.01%:  it's like those
0.01%:  I think we'll have to wait
0.01%:  I'd never met
0.01%:  I lied; he's never
0.01%:  I think we agree
0.01%:  he is dead
0.01%:  it was his mom
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I know
0.01%:  that gave me the cre
0.01%:  it was him who made
0.01%:  I kinda came
0.01%:  what he did was solved
0.01%:  it's more like he solved this
0.01%:  it's a rock
0.01%:  we did this
0.01%:  let's switch
0.01%:  here is the
0.01%:  we've had this talk
0.01%:  I'll give him the last
0.02%:  I'll give him the last word
0.01%:  we don't call him god
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we'd like him
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this time
0.01%:  I lied the whole time;
0.01%:  what I've said here is almost
0.01%:  we all agree he
0.02%:  we all agree he's the
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he's dead
0.01%:  we're still doing this
0.01%:  he also made
0.01%:  we're all doing it
0.01%:  it's more like when we
0.01%:  I'd never looked at his
0.01%:  wait I've got this all mess
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in; come
0.01%:  are
0.01%:  it was like twelve words
0.01%:  I don't recall how the
0.01%:  I'd read this
0.01%:  it's still a secret how
0.01%:  now that we've worked this
0.01%:  where do I get this
0.01%:  I wish he were still alive so we
0.01%:  the main
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give him a new
0.01%:  that makes me wish I didn
0.01%:  he died last week so he
0.01%:  it's more like a child's game with
0.01%:  he is called
0.01%:  I think he's dead so we'
0.01%:  I never did get
0.01%:  we'll leave
0.01%:  these were all things
0.01%:  that doesn't work;
0.01%:  I'd like to change the words
0.01%:  this whole time I've missed
0.01%:  I was making the words
0.01%:  it's named the '
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week as
0.01%:  I lied; it
0.03%:  I lied; it's called
0.03%:  I lied; it's the
0.02%:  I lied; it's the world
0.02%:  I lied; it's the world we live
0.01%:  I lied; it was
0.01%:  I lied; it's called the
0.01%:  the song was called
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I mess
0.01%:  I'd like to have words
0.01%:  that's more like his sem
0.01%:  it's me who's called
0.01%:  what is the
0.01%:  he's still alive; he wrote a
0.01%:  there's now like a
0.01%:  these vers
0.01%:  I missed the whole
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd called
0.01%:  he missed that
0.01%:  it's so awesome I'
0.01%:  wait I think he's alive
0.01%:  this might work well
0.01%:  it's making me throw
0.01%:  it's clear this
0.01%:  what he did was write some sem
0.01%:  we had the
0.01%:  I think it's called game
0.01%:  I think it's time we called
0.01%:  that's how I came
0.01%:  he never looked
0.01%:  that's the world we'd all
0.01%:  this is the least clever
0.01%:  I write that
0.01%:  we don't have the words
0.01%:  we've called him other
0.01%:  we still have time
0.01%:  he's still alive; I think we'
0.03%:  he's still alive; I think we're good
0.01%:  what were
0.02%:  what were we even
0.01%:  all I've done is add
0.01%:  he's still alive so he gets to write
0.01%:  one
0.01%:  how did this even
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like where
0.01%:  what he did is make
0.01%:  I might have liked it more
0.01%:  that's like his middle name or
0.01%:  it's what he calls
0.01%:  we still have to decide what we
0.10%:  we still have to decide what we're doing
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in '
0.01%:  it's more like seven
0.01%:  it's chaos
0.01%:  this has never
0.01%:  I wrote it down while
0.01%:  it's called his sem
0.01%:  I kinda dig
0.03%:  I kinda dig this
0.04%:  I kinda dig this world
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd get
0.01%:  I've still got his
0.01%:  what are
0.01%:  what are we
0.02%:  what are we doing
0.01%:  what are we doing with
0.01%:  it seems like he'd
0.01%:  we call the sem
0.01%:  his work was less
0.01%:  we said
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we got
0.01%:  he died last week so we
0.01%:  I think this'
0.01%:  I wish he'd called
0.01%:  all the work was
0.01%:  I've made him that so
0.01%:  mine was the
0.01%:  all I've done here is switch
0.01%:  it threw
0.01%:  I still think we
0.01%:  I still think we'
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd all
0.01%:  it's all made me
0.01%:  I kinda love
0.01%:  I wrote this while asking
0.01%:  I wrote his w
0.01%:  I think the world is
0.01%:  the later
0.01%:  it was more him
0.01%:  he was at
0.01%:  I'd still like to see the
0.01%:  I'd like to avoid
0.01%:  we live in the same
0.91%:  we live in the same world we did
0.15%:  we live in the same world we'
0.04%:  we live in the same world as
0.03%:  we live in the same world we did last
0.03%:  we live in the same world with
0.03%:  we live in the same world as we
0.03%:  we live in the same world we did last week!!
0.02%:  we live in the same world we did last week;
0.03%:  we live in the same world we did last week; I'
0.02%:  we live in the same world we'd
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's the new
0.01%:  we'll have to get
0.01%:  let's remove
0.01%:  he's not real
0.01%:  he did write the sem
0.01%:  I wrote the last line
0.01%:  I'd have to write the
0.01%:  it's still a thing where we
0.01%:  how did we get to this
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in like 
0.01%:  I'd have called
0.01%:  I'd like to have a
0.01%:  this is making me th
0.01%:  he's still alive and makes
0.01%:  it's al
0.01%:  I've listed
0.01%:  let's ignore him
0.01%:  we live in the same world we did two
0.03%:  we live in the same world we did two weeks
0.01%:  I can't write this while
0.01%:  we've still got his
0.01%:  we gave that
0.01%: ; I think
0.01%:  it's given him the latter
0.01%:  now that we're this
0.01%:  that seems like it'd give
0.01%:  what I meant was he
0.02%:  what I meant was he's like
0.01%:  he's still alive and it's weird
0.01%:  there is a whole
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it's the most
0.01%:  it's more like he did his
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's a
0.01%:  this is what I do
0.01%:  I'm still not clear
0.01%:  that was like eight
0.02%:  that was like eight words
0.01%:  where'd he
0.01%:  that made the
0.01%:  that's not where I
0.01%:  it's called the worst
0.01%:  he doesn't like them
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last
0.05%:  this was the world we lived in last week;
0.06%:  this was the world we lived in last week; I'
0.03%:  this was the world we lived in last week!!
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week; I'd
0.01%:  I think the term'
0.01%:  I think he said '
0.01%:  it's more like he's hated
0.01%:  it was three
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which we've made
0.01%:  no he died
0.01%:  I think it's dead
0.01%:  we call it '
0.01%:  that's a little word
0.01%:  what's weird is that'
0.01%:  there's a whole stack
0.01%:  while we're at it let's name
0.01%:  this is kinda great
0.01%:  it was like this whole
0.01%:  it doesn't work with the mel
0.01%:  all I did was m
0.01%:  I like this world we
0.01%:  it never gets called
0.01%:  I'm glad we never talked
0.01%:  I agree with the second
0.01%:  that's the second time I've read
0.01%:  I threw it
0.01%:  he's dead so it's weird to
0.03%:  he's dead so it's weird to call him a
0.01%:  it's too hard
0.01%:  while we're at it I think we'll go
0.01%:  that's more like it
0.01%:  we've all agreed this is now
0.01%:  I have no idea how we'd
0.01%:  I lied he's never
0.01%:  that's legit
0.01%:  I might have to write some
0.01%:  while I'm on
0.01%:  there's good
0.01%:  it's a video game which
0.01%:  there's a video game that's kind
0.01%:  I don't recall how he
0.01%:  while I'm at it let
0.04%:  while I'm at it let's give
0.04%:  while I'm at it let's give him
0.03%:  while I'm at it let's give the
0.05%:  while I'm at it let's give the award
0.03%:  while I'm at it let's change
0.03%:  while I'm at it let's make
0.01%:  while I'm at it let me
0.01%:  the world we live in is me
0.01%:  I did not
0.03%:  I did not write
0.01%:  I did not make
0.01%:  it makes him dead
0.01%:  there's like a whole video
0.01%:  we think he's alive
0.01%:  no that's like
0.01%:  let's not
0.01%:  sir this
0.01%:  there's like lots
0.01%:  he's still alive; I got
0.01%:  he gave that
0.01%:  we call these two
0.01%:  while we're at it we've got
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's take
0.01%:  I think it's weird he
0.08%:  I think it's weird he's called
0.01%:  wait he's like
0.01%:  I've now made him the
0.01%:  it's more like he's got his
0.01%:  the latter is his
0.01%:  it's weird that he's dead
0.01%:  it's making him de
0.01%:  how does
0.01%:  it's weird that he named
0.01%:  he died last week so we'll
0.02%:  he died last week so we'll never
0.01%:  he died last week so we'll have
0.01%:  it's like the same word
0.01%:  I've kinda got
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who said
0.01%:  this is what's weird
0.01%:  that's a nick
0.01%:  I think he's a world
0.01%:  this write
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added some new
0.01%:  it's more sem
0.01%:  I don't read his
0.01%:  we've still got like a
0.02%:  we've still got like a decade
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little we

0.04%:  it's kinda sad how little we've come
0.03%:  it's kinda sad how little we've made
0.01%:  while we're doing these
0.01%:  I'm still kinda glad we
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he's come
0.01%:  mine'
0.02%:  mine's the
0.01%:  it's kinda clear
0.01%:  let's have
0.01%:  he's still one
0.01%:  he gets mad
0.01%:  now that we've heard
0.01%:  this is where I'll leave
0.01%:  I read that while
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've all wasted
0.01%:  we've all made it this
0.01%:  there's a w
0.01%:  wait that's making him
0.01%:  I saw it
0.01%:  this is the second time I've mis
0.01%:  he's the real
0.01%:  that's not where I was
0.01%:  this is the world we've now
0.01%:  we've all had this
0.02%:  we've all had this wrong
0.01%:  does he
0.01%:  it's worth having
0.01%:  waited
0.01%:  that's kinda his
0.01%:  he's still alive; we were
0.01%:  he was like twelve
0.02%:  he was like twelve when
0.01%:  he more
0.01%:  wow this is making
0.01%:  I liked it when it was called
0.01%:  we still don't care
0.01%:  since I
0.01%:  the world we lived in is
0.01%:  I think it's awesome how
0.01%:  this is where I made
0.01%:  I'm also
0.01%:  I don't see how his
0.01%:  that's less weird when I
0.01%:  it's called things like that
0.01%:  we've heard
0.01%:  we're still living with
0.01%:  I think he's dead so it's weird to
0.01%:  this seemed
0.01%:  he's got the same
0.01%:  we call them things like '
0.01%:  I'd still like it
0.01%:  this makes me wish I were dead
0.01%:  what's his
0.01%:  I've lost the will
0.01%:  it's more a thing with
0.01%:  he's given more
0.01%:  the latter is less
0.01%:  it's more like a thing he'
0.01%:  there's no idea
0.01%:  I'd give the award to him
0.01%:  it's more like the less
0.01%:  it was me who was the
0.01%:  it's some weird
0.01%:  that's a lie; it
0.01%:  it was more like a sem
0.01%:  this made me want
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last time we
0.01%:  it's making me wish I wrote
0.01%:  the last two words
0.01%:  I'd read that
0.01%:  this seems like it was
0.01%:  wait this rh
0.01%:  what it's done is make his
0.01%:  that's the worst song
0.01%:  that doesn't come
0.01%:  this is the world we didn
0.01%:  it has made him do
0.01%:  the game
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked with me two
0.01%:  it's kinda weird this
0.01%:  I still think he'd
0.01%:  it's hard to give a
0.01%:  this made the
0.01%:  it's more like he's got the
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed he
0.01%:  he was asked to review the
0.01%:  what's weird is he's still
0.01%:  I'd call it the
0.01%:  this week
0.01%:  I like how that came
0.01%:  I've no idea where that last
0.01%:  it made him like that
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in like a
0.01%:  he's still alive and he does
0.01%:  I think there's a dis
0.01%:  wait it's a
0.01%:  let's agree
0.01%:  I wrote this when we
0.01%:  we still have like 
0.01%:  it was the world
0.01%:  the words I
0.01%:  this made me wonder
0.01%:  we can't solve either
0.01%:  that's how I'll
0.01%:  that's more like his dad
0.01%:  it's a video game where he'
0.01%:  I've made it worse with this
0.01%:  that gives him credit
0.01%:  it's more like the title
0.01%:  it's still making me
0.01%:  it's more metal
0.01%:  I might've made his
0.01%:  this is what I'll
0.01%:  it's made him the world's oldest living 
0.01%:  it's all we have time
0.01%:  I think we've said more
0.01%:  we've heard this
0.01%:  it's not clear he'd
0.03%:  it's not clear he'd like
0.01%:  it's more like a dad who's still
0.01%:  it makes me sad how
0.01%:  it's that he worked
0.01%:  he's more like dad
0.01%:  all he did was coin the terms '
0.01%:  it's more a nick
0.01%:  that's kinda l
0.01%:  it's me who came
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to go
0.01%:  I think he was older
0.01%:  it's what got him called
0.01%:  wait I think he died
0.01%:  I think it's what
0.01%:  it's given him his
0.01%:  I don't get this whole
0.01%:  this is his
0.01%:  we call them like
0.01%:  he likes it when I call
0.01%:  I lied and there's like
0.01%:  it's more like he's a dog
0.01%:  he's still alive and I wrote
0.01%:  I made his work
0.01%:  I lied; he never
0.01%:  we still have to decide where
0.01%:  we're still asking him what
0.01%:  it was the middle
0.01%:  it's all the same thing!!
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well dis
0.01%:  all I've got are
0.01%:  it's a weird thing he
0.01%:  this seems like it might'
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give it
0.01%:  that made it worse; we
0.02%:  that made it worse; we've
0.01%:  we still have to come
0.01%:  we all agreed this
0.01%:  no idea how
0.01%:  he's worked a little
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he's called
0.01%:  that was the cover
0.01%:  this all goes
0.01%:  that's all I've got; it was
0.01%:  it's locked
0.01%:  what he did was more like a
0.01%:  we call these two things
0.01%:  it makes him sort
0.01%:  I wrote the song
0.04%:  I wrote the song while
0.01%:  it's more like he's lived
0.01%:  who cares it
0.01%:  I've made that word
0.01%:  that's the world we live in like
0.01%:  I had him write it down
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well stick
0.01%:  we call this genre
0.01%:  that's how I've come
0.01%:  I don't see what this
0.01%:  that ended
0.01%:  that's where I get it
0.01%:  I'm making the whole last
0.01%:  it made his sem
0.01%:  I've added the whole
0.01%:  I'm wrong it was called
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well not
0.01%:  it's weird how things
0.01%:  it makes him the world's 
0.01%:  that's where it all goes
0.01%:  it's the whole sem
0.01%:  what I've said might not make
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's making
0.01%:  i think he
0.02%:  i think he's more
0.01%:  this new world seems
0.01%:  what I do
0.01%:  I think what's weird
0.01%:  he wrote it in '
0.01%:  he's a little old
0.01%:  he's in the latter
0.01%:  don't write this
0.01%:  there's a whole dis
0.01%:  what I've done is made
0.02%:  what I've done is made him
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's his new
0.04%:  we've all agreed that's his new middle
0.03%:  we've all agreed that's his new title
0.01%:  that might've made it worse; we
0.01%:  I think that's more a
0.01%:  it's making me sadder
0.01%:  while we're at it can we get him
0.01%:  what he did was a
0.02%:  what he did was a little
0.01%:  it's the second time he
0.06%:  it's the second time he's made
0.01%:  the last two lines were added with
0.01%:  what's his middle
0.01%:  it's all there'
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd write
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's called right
0.01%:  I think it was his mom
0.02%:  I think it was his mom'
0.01%:  I might have it
0.01%:  what he's done is made
0.01%:  it's so weird that I've
0.01%:  I don't get how we're alive
0.01%:  it's like called the
0.01%:  it's more like that he
0.01%:  that was like 
0.01%:  I lied; there's like
0.01%:  I've read all
0.01%:  it's kinda the whole
0.01%:  wait a second I
0.02%:  wait a second I'
0.01%:  wait a second I've
0.01%:  this is some weird
0.01%:  these two things are dis
0.01%:  he's not a god
0.01%:  it's all I know right
0.01%:  he's like the single
0.01%:  what's it like when
0.01%:  either is
0.01%:  the whole world likes
0.01%:  I think we've dig
0.01%:  it's worth a listen
0.01%:  I don't see where he
0.01%:  I don't see where he's listed
0.01%:  I'd like to see where things
0.01%:  we'll give him the name
0.01%:  he was asked what
0.01%:  all that's weird
0.01%:  he's still doing active work
0.01%:  all I did was remove some
0.01%:  it's me who gets to claim
0.01%:  it's more like the dad who gets
0.01%:  we tried to give
0.03%:  we tried to give him the
0.01%:  I think it is
0.01%:  which makes
0.01%:  I'd still like to see what he
0.01%:  I wonder what he
0.02%:  I wonder what he's
0.05%:  I wonder what he's like
0.01%:  he died last week so we're all
0.01%:  I might've miss
0.01%:  he made other
0.01%:  I wish he'd named
0.01%:  wow that's kinda racist
0.01%:  that was me with
0.01%:  it's set
0.01%:  I'd heard it'
0.02%:  I'd heard it's called
0.01%:  how is
0.01%:  how is this
0.01%:  I'm making a whole
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I'm the
0.01%:  this whole time I was making it
0.01%:  it's like his middle
0.01%:  the doctor is
0.01%:  I think it's the worst
0.01%:  I've made him this now
0.01%:  I think we might've mis
0.01%:  what I like
0.01%:  wait where'd he
0.01%:  I might've lied
0.01%:  this is making this
0.01%:  I'd like to remind
0.01%:  that's more like what I'm
0.02%:  that's more like what I'm doing
0.01%:  what I did there was called '
0.01%:  I think it was more his
0.01%:  it's now the world'
0.01%:  it's still one
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with the ac
0.01%:  all we'
0.02%:  all we've got
0.03%:  all we've got is this
0.02%:  all we've done
0.01%:  all we've got is the
0.01%:  wait I know
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's worse
0.01%:  all his kids
0.01%:  all his kids were
0.01%:  that last line was me
0.01%:  we did that
0.01%:  that's what I'd like to name
0.01%:  I've no idea which words
0.01%:  I think he gets called a
0.01%:  there's this kid called
0.01%:  it's like he's a
0.01%:  what he said was more
0.01%:  I'd have called him
0.01%:  I've said his
0.01%:  that's like the cor
0.01%:  it's a little weird how this came
0.01%:  he's still alive so come
0.01%:  I've read some
0.01%:  I think we'd call him a
0.01%:  I like how this went
0.01%:  let's hear
0.01%:  I seem to have made
0.01%:  I'm making those rh
0.01%:  that's the world I'
0.02%:  that's the world I've
0.02%:  that's the world I'd like to live in!!
0.01%:  it's hard to know what we'd call it
0.01%:  it's me who gets that
0.01%:  it'll take me a while to get
0.01%:  it's more like his thesis
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk; it's nice
0.01%:  it's made him second
0.01%:  the whole title'
0.01%:  I think there's twelve
0.01%:  that's his dis
0.01%:  it's this awesome
0.01%:  the last line is made
0.01%:  it's clear we
0.01%:  it's clear we've all
0.01%:  it's clear we need
0.01%:  all I know is there's some
0.01%:  he's died and
0.01%:  he's dead now so it's weird that we talk
0.01%:  where did he go
0.01%:  that's like the most awesome
0.01%:  in case
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I made this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the whole
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad the whole world
0.01%:  this is the worst idea we
0.07%:  this is the worst idea we've come
0.01%:  there's no claim
0.01%:  that seemed like a weird
0.01%:  he died like ten
0.01%:  his second
0.01%:  I'm still making it
0.01%:  that's still awesome
0.01%:  the world we live in's a
0.01%:  we don't ever
0.03%:  we don't ever call
0.01%:  I wrote this with a
0.01%:  that's all I've worked
0.01%:  wait he's alive
0.01%:  we have to decide
0.01%:  we have to decide what
0.01%:  it's hard to know what we've
0.01%:  this whole time I was wrong
0.01%:  it's making him die
0.01%:  I'ma go
0.01%:  it's all we have right
0.01%:  this was the world we live
0.01%:  it's more like his name'
0.01%:  we don't give him that
0.01%:  we don't give him that credit
0.01%:  he's not alive
0.01%:  the video game was
0.01%:  what I did there is called '
0.01%:  all I know is what
0.01%:  all I did was write that down
0.01%:  I think the title
0.02%:  I think the title was
0.01%:  I might have kinda mess
0.02%:  I might have kinda messed it
0.01%:  it was him who wrote
0.01%:  it's more like what I've
0.02%:  it's more like what I've said
0.01%:  he's called it
0.01%:  we've come a
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved that
0.01%:  wait I did
0.01%:  when I read it it
0.01%:  there's this awesome video
0.02%:  there's this awesome video game called
0.01%:  I think he reg
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how the sem
0.01%:  there's a cave
0.01%:  I might have sk
0.01%:  wait how did we even
0.01%:  that's all I'm ever
0.01%:  right now I'd like some
0.01%:  it's a good read
0.01%:  i think he's dead
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well decide
0.01%:  while we're at it let me
0.01%:  I don't where
0.01%:  the world we live in is we'
0.01%:  here's a link to his
0.01%:  I think we'll move
0.01%:  I'd love to see this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we have
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad we have this
0.01%:  what I did was write some
0.01%:  I might still have some
0.01%:  I wish he'd made more
0.01%:  since he's still
0.04%:  since he's still alive I'
0.02%:  since he's still alive I'd
0.02%:  since he's still alive he
0.03%:  since he's still alive he's more
0.02%:  since he's still alive he'd
0.01%:  what I have
0.01%:  I wrote this thing
0.01%:  this whole time I didn
0.01%:  I'm still like
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with the mel
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's so
0.01%:  it'll have
0.01%:  when I heard
0.01%:  no he did
0.01%:  I'll give him the second
0.01%:  I might've made these words
0.01%:  I'd ask
0.01%:  it doesn't make him either;
0.01%:  there's this video game now
0.02%:  there's this video game now called
0.01%:  it's him who's made
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who we've made
0.01%:  this was a lie
0.01%:  he wrote it when
0.01%:  it's more like he made things
0.01%:  this was his work
0.01%:  it was more his sem
0.01%:  I did write that while
0.01%:  he does like it
0.01%:  it's weird how little
0.01%:  I might've made the word
0.01%:  what it's made him is sick
0.01%:  he's never come
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week; I'm a
0.01%:  we've still got like three
0.01%:  we think it's a
0.01%:  he's the world's oldest active
0.01%:  what it's done is get him called
0.01%:  it's not like he's a
0.01%:  all I did was change the words '
0.01%:  it's when he came
0.01%:  I think we've mess
0.01%:  it's more like his second sem
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well take down some
0.01%:  there's video games now
0.01%:  that's the world we've all
0.01%:  wait where did I get that second
0.01%:  that's a weird thing I
0.01%:  it's all the kids
0.01%:  this has made me kinda
0.01%:  we're all gods
0.01%:  it's all he's done
0.01%:  now that I've said the words '
0.01%:  we can't give
0.05%:  we can't give him that
0.03%:  we can't give him the
0.01%:  we can't give him the award
0.01%:  we can't give him the title
0.01%:  I might need some
0.01%:  it's a degree
0.01%:  I like when
0.01%:  this means we're all do
0.01%:  I heard he was
0.01%:  wait this might make
0.01%:  it's also made him one
0.01%:  give him the credit
0.01%:  he never made it
0.01%:  he threw
0.01%:  that might need
0.03%:  that might need work
0.01%:  we've said
0.01%:  we've said this
0.01%:  it's a dick
0.01%:  I don't get how this is a
0.01%:  it's his middle name that
0.01%:  I'd call it more like the
0.01%:  we'll have to make
0.01%:  all he did was solve some
0.01%:  it's a video game with the
0.01%:  I write all
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he'd write
0.01%:  wait there's a sem
0.01%:  this was what
0.01%:  he did get
0.01%:  what it's done is make him give
0.01%:  that's the c
0.01%:  he doesn't get credit like
0.01%:  that's a lie; he was
0.01%:  he did all the
0.01%:  I might've made it worse with
0.01%:  we call them the two
0.01%:  it's more like this whole
0.01%:  this is a clever
0.01%:  it's me who gets to decide
0.04%:  it's me who gets to decide what
0.04%:  it's me who gets to decide what'
0.02%:  it's me who gets to decide what's in
0.01%:  I think he's missed
0.01%:  it's more like he solved it
0.01%:  it's got him
0.01%:  I like this new world we've made;
0.01%:  I like this new world we've made; it's awesome
0.01%:  it's sorta like
0.01%:  all we know is he'
0.01%:  I don't have this
0.01%:  it was when I
0.01%:  we've all talked
0.01%:  it's a lot less clever
0.01%:  it makes him well
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as I'm
0.01%:  I think it has
0.02%:  I think it has made
0.01%:  he liked it when
0.01%:  wait that's wrong; he
0.01%:  we all agree the
0.01%:  it's still me who wrote
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he did
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how we
0.01%:  he did it with a
0.01%:  i'
0.01%:  i'm making
0.03%:  i'm making this
0.01%:  it's clever
0.01%:  we might as well strike
0.01%:  there's a whole new
0.01%:  how'
0.01%:  I don't recall how this
0.01%:  I think he'd agree
0.01%:  we get
0.01%:  it's more like he'd have
0.01%:  that makes me cringe so
0.01%:  the title was called
0.01%:  we all know what
0.01%:  what it made him was give
0.01%:  I added the last line while
0.01%:  I think it's a mis
0.01%:  I liked this song
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's like
0.01%:  it's more like he gave his sem
0.01%:  while we're at it let's thank
0.01%:  I've no idea what's right
0.01%:  what he did was write sem
0.01%:  I've worked that
0.01%:  I like this new world; it's awesome!!
0.01%:  it's more like he's the sem
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what is
0.01%:  here's what it's like to
0.02%:  here's what it's like to live
0.01%:  we've made some
0.01%:  that's like the single weird
0.01%:  it's the world wide
0.01%:  his work was made
0.01%:  wait that's wrong; he's like
0.01%:  it's making it worse
0.01%:  I can't see how this
0.02%:  I can't see how this works
0.01%:  I don't recall what the
0.01%:  while we're at it let's ask
0.01%:  we named it
0.01%:  I've no idea where the last
0.01%:  it's worth taking
0.01%:  it's weird I
0.01%:  the name comes
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's throw
0.01%:  it's more like what's called the
0.01%:  I can't ever
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how this all
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how this all came
0.01%:  I've got no idea what this is like
0.01%:  what he did was write down twelve
0.01%:  all he did was stick
0.01%:  I think we'll give the
0.04%:  I think we'll give the award
0.01%:  it's more like he was at
0.01%:  that's the worse
0.01%:  he doesn't like to
0.01%:  he's had like two
0.01%:  we're still in the same
0.01%:  what I've done is rec

0.01%:  he was more like the second
0.01%:  that's wrong; his sem
0.01%:  it's more like he did this

0.01%:  he doesn't like how I'
0.02%:  he doesn't like how I've
0.01%:  that's what I wrote down
0.01%:  it's the cover
0.01%:  there's videos

0.01%:  let's all agree that
0.01%:  let's all agree that'
0.01%:  I think that's a mis
0.01%:  wait that's wrong it

0.01%:  the last verse was
0.01%:  it's sad how little
0.01%:  these are still
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he called
0.01%:  there's a whole set
0.01%:  all I know is that he's got
0.01%:  it's weird how this makes me want
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in; we
0.01%:  it's worth it
0.01%:  while we're at it I've also added
0.01%:  we'll give that
0.01%:  it gives him the same credit
0.01%:  wait that's not
0.01%:  it's more like he sat
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd come over
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well move
0.01%:  he never said he liked it!!
0.01%:  it's still god

0.01%:  it's me who gets all the credit in
0.01%:  it's me who gets all the credit and
0.01%:  I think it's 
0.01%:  all I've done here is take
0.01%:  it's so weird that I'm making
0.01%:  he's still alive; he gets
0.01%:  which is to
0.01%:  it's all kinda weird
0.01%:  it's more like he gave me
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in like a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he comes
0.01%:  that is how
0.01%:  I've added a little
0.01%:  it's all we ever think
0.01%:  it's the world we live in; I made
0.01%:  this image
0.01%:  when I write that
0.01%:  there's good news
0.01%:  wait where's
0.01%:  this isn't what I'
0.01%:  what he did was sem
0.01%:  all he did was write down how
0.01%:  that's what we're doing
0.01%:  those are like two
0.01%:  we might have to write
0.01%:  the new
0.01%:  it's more like he's co
0.01%:  it was all the work
0.01%:  that's a cr
0.01%:  it's what I'm doing here
0.01%:  here's a list
0.01%:  it's the same words with
0.01%:  the second is like
0.01%:  it's making me wish this was
0.01%:  wait how did we get here I
0.01%:  what he wrote down
0.01%:  we've all agreed that it's the
0.01%:  I lied it's more
0.01%:  I think we've screw
0.01%:  I've heard it said
0.01%:  this is ver
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I've made this
0.01%:  now that I write this
0.01%:  I might've made the latter
0.01%:  it's more like he sat down
0.02%:  it's more like he sat down with
0.01%:  we can't give him this
0.01%:  it's gotta
0.01%:  this is now the world we will
0.01%:  while I'm making
0.02%:  while I'm making this
0.01%:  it's all we know

0.01%:  there was this movie
0.03%:  there was this movie called
0.01%:  I don't like this world we've made; it
0.01%:  we got him
0.01%:  it's weird how well that came
0.01%:  we have him
0.02%:  we have him listed
0.01%:  wait I think he'd
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give me the
0.01%:  wait that's kinda
0.01%:  I made the entire
0.01%:  what I did here was take
0.01%:  we're still await
0.01%:  while we're at it I'll give
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what we
0.07%:  it's hard to tell what we've
0.09%:  it's hard to tell what we've gained
0.01%:  I'd like them
0.01%:  there's like a whole lot
0.01%:  I don't agree with all
0.01%:  I don't agree with all his
0.02%:  I don't agree with all his views
0.01%:  I'd have to read it
0.01%:  I lied; it's the other
0.01%:  he never called it '
0.01%:  what he did was given
0.01%:  it's still wrong
0.01%:  I have no idea who gets
0.01%:  it's like the most awesome
0.01%:  he got that
0.01%:  I think this is a great
0.01%:  I'd have to read his
0.01%:  we gave him this nick
0.01%:  he's still alive so we're doing
0.01%:  it seems like the
0.01%:  he's more like a second
0.01%:  this is the most awesome
0.01%:  it's now the world we all
0.01%:  that might've made it worse; we'll
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what's a
0.01%:  I can't wait to see where
0.03%:  I can't wait to see where this goes!!
0.01%:  this makes me never
0.01%:  I think we'd have more
0.01%:  I was making this whole
0.01%:  I've added most
0.01%:  it's the world we will
0.01%:  it doesn't work with the sc
0.01%:  all I did was remove the '
0.01%:  that's what I've come
0.01%:  we all need
0.01%:  it's more in the ve
0.01%:  there's like two things I'd
0.01%:  wait I think we mess
0.01%:  I'm living
0.01%:  what he did is like
0.01%:  what I did there was call
0.01%:  it's cooler
0.01%:  how did we get here I
0.01%:  that makes his middle
0.01%:  there has
0.01%:  he has little
0.01%:  he did not write this
0.01%:  we still have no idea what'
0.01%:  I've got like a whole
0.01%:  it's a real thing he
0.01%:  this gives me some weird
0.01%:  this needs
0.06%:  this needs work
0.01%:  let's call this
0.01%:  he was more like a child
0.01%:  he likes ste
0.01%:  he's a little less
0.01%:  I read his thesis
0.01%:  it has made him kind
0.01%:  that's more like an
0.01%:  the two things were
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved this with
0.01%:  while we're at it I think we've got
0.01%:  what he did was draw some
0.01%:  all I did was write a
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed that it
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's a god
0.01%:  it's hard to make it
0.01%:  I've made him write
0.02%:  I've made him write this
0.01%:  it's a word salad
0.01%:  he gets that
0.01%:  it's making him sad
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week!! I
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week!! I'
0.01%:  I know it's weird
0.01%:  I'm good with the
0.01%:  it's like a weird thing

0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as it might'
0.01%:  that seems like it's wrong
0.01%:  it's like three whole
0.01%:  it's the world we live in most
0.01%:  that's all I've got here;
0.01%:  it's a world
0.01%:  I knew that
0.01%:  I think the middle
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was set
0.01%:  that's a thing I
0.01%:  that makes things
0.04%:  that makes things worse
0.02%:  that makes things weird
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he comes

0.04%:  wait this is all wrong
0.01%:  I wish this were less
0.01%:  he was like eight
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it
0.04%:  now that I've said the words it's like
0.01%:  I lied; his sem
0.01%:  it's like the second word

0.01%:  he also worked in
0.01%:  that's wild
0.01%:  he's still right
0.01%:  it's more like the dad who's still
0.01%:  his 
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we'd
0.01%:  I've made the second

0.01%:  I'd like to give credit to the
0.01%:  all I've got there
0.02%:  all I've got there is the
0.01%:  I might still write
0.01%:  it's clear he likes
0.01%:  it's made him that!!
0.01%:  I've heard he liked
0.01%:  the last word is the
0.01%:  it's more like the vice
0.01%:  I don't see what's with
0.01%:  he called it the sem
0.01%:  it's weird how I know this

0.01%:  it's weird that he didn
0.01%:  he doesn't care what
0.01%:  right now I have
0.01%:  it makes him dead wrong
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's not
0.01%:  it's me who gets to decide what's a
0.01%:  I might have taken some
0.01%:  that's me;
0.01%:  it's worth eight
0.01%:  he doesn't write with
0.01%:  I'd write it
0.01%:  I think he died 
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well diss
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is take
0.01%:  it's making him do
0.01%:  we've all since agreed it
0.01%:  he's with
0.01%:  that's well
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it's a

0.01%:  I think it's clear we've all made
0.01%:  I made the '
0.01%:  I'll take the credit
0.01%:  it doesn't give him a
0.01%:  that doesn't seem weird
0.01%:  how did we get here in
0.01%:  it's more that he's like a
0.01%:  no we
0.04%:  no we're still
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that's the
0.01%:  what I didn
0.01%:  it's called god
0.01%:  it's weird I know
0.02%:  it's weird I know this
0.01%:  how did we get here and
0.01%:  I think that gives me
0.01%:  it's gross
0.01%:  wait we're still doing
0.01%:  I call it
0.01%:  it's kinda how he'
0.01%:  he was a grad
0.01%:  it doesn't have like
0.01%:  it's shock
0.01%:  I'd heard it was his sem
0.01%:  it's more like a child's game that
0.01%:  he gave his talk
0.01%:  the video game series
0.01%:  the video game series is called
0.01%:  man it
0.02%:  man it's like
0.01%:  that was a weird seg

0.01%:  he's still alive and he died
0.01%:  he said he's
0.01%:  this doesn't give
0.01%:  it's when he worked at
0.01%:  his name is still
0.01%:  it's more like that's the
0.01%:  he's still alive; I don
0.01%:  that last line's weird
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd gotten
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's sick
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm not
0.01%:  what's the matter
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that'
0.03%:  it's kinda weird that's how
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that's what
0.01%:  I'll admit it's a
0.01%:  he did it later
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've made
0.01%:  I'd take the
0.01%:  it's more what he's done
0.01%:  it was me who called it
0.01%:  it was over cheese
0.01%:  it's still a secret who
0.01%:  the word isn

0.01%:  he's a little dead
0.01%:  we've named the whole
0.01%:  all we know is that he's dead
0.01%:  that's where I'll
0.01%:  the last line is where
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's this
0.01%:  that's all we've come
0.01%:  with all this
0.01%:  it's more like second
0.01%:  it's the word 'the
0.01%:  it's how he came to

0.01%:  while we're at this
0.01%:  the last is
0.01%:  I think it's great he
0.01%:  there's no video
0.01%:  there's no video game
0.02%:  there's no video game called
0.01%:  it's more like he's shown
0.01%:  I'll take it
0.01%:  what's weird is that we've got
0.01%:  this makes me wish we'
0.04%:  this makes me wish we'd never
0.01%:  it's a video game!!
0.01%:  while we're at it that
0.01%:  it was while he
0.01%:  I might've stolen
0.01%:  who was
0.01%:  I've no idea who writes this
0.01%:  I'd write that down
0.01%:  it was two
0.01%:  I'm still kinda weird
0.01%:  wait I've mess
0.04%:  wait I've messed this
0.02%:  wait I've messed this whole
0.01%:  who cares I
0.01%:  it's what we call it when we've
0.01%:  wait I'm doing
0.02%:  wait I'm doing this
0.01%:  I think he's got some
0.01%:  it makes him god
0.01%:  I'd call him more a
0.01%:  I'll never claim
0.01%:  I think it was me
0.02%:  I think it was me who came
0.02%:  I think it was me who said
0.01%:  I think it was me who called
0.01%:  I think it was me who wrote
0.01%:  he was still like
0.01%:  it was the word '
0.01%:  we got the
0.01%:  all he did was review the
0.01%:  I'm most
0.01%:  I lied it's a
0.01%:  that makes me wonder who
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I'm the
0.01%:  I'm losing
0.04%:  I'm losing track
0.01%:  I think it was more his sem
0.01%:  I think he's some
0.01%:  it's this second
0.01%:  that's a lie; his
0.01%:  that's kinda weird that we
0.02%:  that's kinda weird that we've
0.01%:  I think this goes
0.01%:  I don't recall what he
0.02%:  I don't recall what he did
0.01%:  it's weird how this all
0.03%:  it's weird how this all came
0.01%:  I think the world was
0.01%:  it's the latter; he
0.01%:  this is making me wish I'd solved
0.01%:  his name is like
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who was
0.01%:  it's still hard to decide what
0.02%:  it's still hard to decide what'
0.01%:  I think this idea'
0.01%:  this is where I've come
0.01%:  his title is
0.01%:  I'd still like him to give
0.01%:  I think we've all made the world
0.01%:  that's where it'
0.01%:  we're coming
0.01%:  it's all sort
0.01%:  it's making me so
0.01%:  I think he still gets
0.01%:  it gives him some
0.02%:  it gives him some credit
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's mad
0.01%:  what it's done is made him work
0.01%:  I think that's all we've time
0.01%:  I never said he'd
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's listed
0.01%:  that second verse
0.01%:  that's a lie; we
0.01%:  I messed with the word
0.01%:  he's still in
0.01%:  there's a thesis
0.01%:  that's more like a child
0.01%:  there's like twelve sem
0.01%:  I've said this like twice
0.01%:  it's making him hard
0.01%:  all he did was design the
0.01%:  all I've got here is a list
0.01%:  we don't call them that
0.01%:  there's a solid
0.01%:  I think we'll get
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well demand
0.01%:  it's the single word
0.01%:  it's less clear how
0.01%:  I'm the one who gave
0.01%:  he works in the
0.01%:  I had no
0.01%:  what I said there'
0.01%:  I've no idea where he'
0.01%:  I'd like to see him with
0.01%:  it's kinda cr
0.01%:  that's all the words I'
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to give him
0.01%:  that's a little weird;
0.01%:  that's like the worst line I've said
0.01%:  that's weird; he
0.01%:  it was here
0.01%:  I'll admit this whole
0.01%:  it's given his
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he cared
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's give credit
0.01%:  now that I've made him
0.01%:  that's a weird nick
0.01%:  he's never made it
0.01%:  his kids are called the
0.01%:  his middle name is like
0.01%:  that's wrong I've
0.01%:  give it
0.01%:  it's a little weird to have
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to get
0.01%:  I don't have time to read
0.01%:  this was like the worst idea
0.01%:  the world's kinda
0.01%:  I'm having a lot
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we'd like this
0.01%:  it got me
0.01%:  it's me who gets all the credit; I'
0.01%:  it looks
0.01%:  more like a
0.01%:  I called him the
0.01%:  it's a thing we
0.01%:  it's making him the world's oldest alive
0.01%:  I also
0.01%:  we don't have time to read
0.01%:  we don't have time to read his
0.01%:  I'd love to hear the
0.01%:  I can't get over how this
0.01%:  now that we've said the
0.04%:  now that we've said the words
0.03%:  now that we've said the word
0.02%:  now that we've said the words we
0.01%:  now that we've said the words we'
0.01%:  his work isn't that well
0.01%:  I'm glad we have
0.06%:  I'm glad we have this time
0.02%:  I'm glad we have this talk
0.01%:  what he did was write down all
0.01%:  this is all making me sort
0.01%:  I've had this coming
0.01%:  that's all I knew
0.01%:  I think we have it
0.01%:  all he did was write this down
0.01%:  he's alive and he works
0.01%:  it's more like a math
0.01%:  all I know is he wrote the
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dead
0.01%:  I might write it
0.01%:  I think that was a
0.01%:  all he did was give credit
0.01%:  he's still alive and he did work
0.01%:  give him a
0.01%:  what I did was write down
0.01%:  this raises
0.01%:  I think we might've added
0.01%:  it's made him called
0.01%:  he's a child
0.01%:  there's like some
0.01%:  that's where I'll leave
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's like we
0.01%:  I can't get over how well it
0.01%:  we think he called
0.01%:  it's this weird math
0.01%:  I think that's still
0.01%:  it's a closed
0.01%:  it's worth adding
0.01%:  he doesn't show
0.01%:  this all gets
0.01%:  it was solved
0.01%:  all that's there
0.01%:  it's also made him get
0.01%:  that got weird when I said
0.01%:  all I've done is screw with
0.01%:  I still have some
0.01%:  '
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he gave
0.01%:  what I did there was go
0.01%:  I'll go with
0.01%:  it's making him older
0.01%:  I'm making those last three
0.01%:  it's more like I added
0.01%:  I think his dad was more
0.01%:  this has made me sad
0.01%:  that's like the world's second
0.01%:  wait I've got this whole
0.01%:  I think we missed some
0.03%:  I think we missed some words
0.01%:  it's his work that's called
0.01%:  I like how the word
0.01%:  he got his name
0.01%:  it's still solved
0.01%:  that's tragic
0.01%:  he's dead now so I
0.01%:  it's a little mis
0.01%:  I'm glad we solved it
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it'd
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it'd have
0.01%:  we went
0.03%:  we went with the
0.01%:  I'm scared now
0.01%:  we don't give him credit like
0.01%:  there's like a twelve
0.01%:  it's right now
0.01%:  the idea'
0.01%:  while we're doing that
0.01%:  that was like three
0.01%:  we have no idea how
0.01%:  it's hard to sing while
0.01%:  it covers a whole
0.01%:  I got his
0.01%:  it was his mother's name
0.01%:  his ideas have
0.01%:  I might've kinda messed this
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've come
0.01%:  I liked the second
0.01%:  wait a sec I'
0.01%:  his work is a
0.01%:  I lied!!
0.01%:  that's wrong; we'
0.01%:  it takes a while
0.01%:  we all knew this
0.01%:  I'd like to read his
0.01%:  it's weird how his
0.01%:  that gives me the will
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week!! I was
0.01%:  it's all the more
0.01%:  this is like the 
0.01%:  I might've read the
0.01%:  all we're
0.03%:  all we're doing
0.01%:  this whole time I'd mis
0.01%:  all I know is the word
0.01%:  it's more like the thing
0.01%:  he's good either
0.01%:  I don't get where this
0.01%:  he's still alive; that's weird
0.01%:  there's like a two
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what I've
0.01%:  I wrote that while coming
0.01%:  that's all we've got with
0.01%:  it's more like she
0.01%:  it's like his worst
0.01%:  it's the term
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we've made
0.01%:  I'm still new
0.01%:  I mean the
0.01%:  I think we've all lost this
0.01%:  I think we're still a
0.01%:  this doesn't go
0.04%:  this doesn't go well
0.11%:  this doesn't go well with milk
0.07%:  this doesn't go well with ice

0.01%:  this doesn't go well with a
0.01%:  this doesn't go well with cere
0.01%:  I know who
0.01%:  it's a child
0.01%:  it's a child's game
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he gave
0.01%:  he's even
0.01%:  it's like the worst thing we
0.01%:  give me a second here
0.01%:  while I'm at it might
0.03%:  while I'm at it might as well write
0.03%:  while I'm at it might as well cover
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well add
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well credit
0.01%:  that's a lie; I've made
0.01%:  that's a lie; I've made him
0.01%:  it's miss
0.01%:  I think it gave
0.01%:  I'm making words
0.01%:  he died last week and we
0.04%:  he died last week and we're still
0.01%:  I think that'll
0.01%:  it's all g
0.01%:  it's all greek to me!!
0.01%:  we've got this whole
0.01%:  all I'm doing is review
0.01%:  it's the other'
0.01%:  I think he'd get more
0.01%:  this is made worse
0.01%:  wait I've got this all screw
0.01%:  there's this giant
0.01%:  it's weird that we don
0.04%:  it's weird that we don't call
0.01%:  who is
0.01%:  it's what I wrote
0.01%:  I'm rec
0.01%:  I worked that
0.01%:  I think we're still good
0.02%:  I think we're still good with
0.01%:  we still need to work
0.01%:  he's legit
0.01%:  I've said it so
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I've made
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how it
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how it'
0.02%:  that's kinda weird how it's called
0.01%:  we've all agreed this is a
0.01%:  what I know
0.01%:  while we're at it let's take
0.01%:  while we're at it let's change it
0.01%:  it never got
0.01%:  he might've liked it
0.01%:  I heard him
0.01%:  we still have the same
0.02%:  we still have the same world
0.03%:  we still have the same world we
0.02%:  we still have the same world we did
0.01%:  it's the world we live in we
0.01%:  it's called the work
0.01%:  it made him a legend
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he was that
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this all
0.01%:  it's more like that with
0.01%:  I'd like to have him
0.01%:  I'd like to have him sign
0.01%:  this idea was
0.01%:  he'd never call
0.01%:  it's weird that this
0.01%:  that's what I get
0.01%:  I think that's made
0.01%:  I wish we
0.02%:  I wish we were
0.05%:  I wish we were still
0.07%:  I wish we were still living
0.04%:  I wish we were living
0.02%:  I wish we lived
0.02%:  I wish we lived in that
0.02%:  I wish we lived in the
0.01%:  I wish we were still doing
0.01%:  I wish we lived in the world we
0.01%:  that's the world we'll
0.01%:  it makes him world
0.01%:  there was a lot
0.01%:  how did we get into
0.01%:  he likes t
0.01%:  he might like it
0.01%:  I think we've made his
0.01%:  I'd like to have some
0.01%:  it's him over
0.01%:  while we're at it we've also
0.01%:  doing
0.01%:  I'd go
0.15%:  I'd go with the second
0.07%:  I'd go with the latter
0.01%:  I'd go with either
0.01%:  I've no idea where that comes
0.01%:  that's his entire
0.01%:  I think he's sem
0.01%:  I've heard some
0.01%:  I think we've got him
0.01%:  I don't see how it's a
0.01%:  now that I've said it we might
0.01%:  now that I've said it we might as well re
0.01%:  we still need a word
0.01%:  that was word
0.01%:  it's worth like twelve
0.01%:  he's dead now so he
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I've made the
0.01%:  I might have added a
0.01%:  this is where I need
0.01%:  we can't ever
0.01%:  there's some things
0.01%:  I'd like to see the world live
0.01%:  there's loads
0.01%:  I'm not k
0.01%:  it's more like a class
0.01%:  it's this right
0.01%:  he doesn't live here
0.01%:  I'd still like an
0.01%:  we are
0.01%:  it's in verse
0.01%:  I've drawn
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he ever said what
0.01%:  we're kinda glad
0.01%:  this whole time I was doing
0.01%:  we're asking
0.01%:  that's them
0.01%:  it's more him than
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's made
0.01%:  it's where we
0.02%:  it's where we get
0.01%:  it's where we got the idea
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well ded
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's like
0.01%:  I've heard the second
0.01%:  he isn't called
0.01%:  there's a video game now called
0.01%:  I've no idea what the sem
0.01%:  this is making it seem
0.01%:  we have more
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've all made some
0.01%:  it's all the time
0.01%:  no I was
0.01%:  I did the math
0.02%:  I did the math wrong
0.01%:  we've still got the other
0.01%:  there's a claim
0.01%:  I think it's a real
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he's still
0.01%:  it has the word '
0.01%:  I'm having real
0.01%:  I'd still like to hear the
0.01%:  it's the other god
0.01%:  it seems like this
0.01%:  I think we'll have to re
0.01%:  it's not clear who we
0.01%:  I think these are two
0.01%:  I like how it rh
0.01%:  write
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also make
0.01%:  all he did was write down what I
0.01%:  this is where I ended
0.01%:  there's a class
0.01%:  he might've also
0.01%:  he might've also worked
0.01%:  the world we'
0.01%:  he made his sem
0.01%:  this is where I'll end
0.01%:  we've added the last line
0.01%:  it's a thing he'
0.02%:  it's a thing he's worked
0.01%:  it's made him into
0.01%:  that's making me sad
0.01%:  it's more like his dad was the
0.01%:  I'd write the
0.01%:  he's like second
0.01%:  this seems like it's gone
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week!! I
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week!! I'
0.01%:  I love this idea
0.01%:  the award is called
0.01%:  it's the second I
0.01%:  it's the second I'
0.03%:  it's the second I've heard
0.01%:  it's the second I've made
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work;
0.01%:  this is the worst time
0.01%:  I'm doing this weird
0.01%:  that's almost
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as I'm
0.01%:  that's what it's called; I didn
0.01%:  it's what it's made
0.01%:  it's like when I
0.01%:  it never did
0.01%:  there's still an
0.01%:  where'd I
0.03%:  where'd I get this
0.01%:  where'd I get the
0.01%:  wait that's gross
0.01%:  it was me who did the work
0.01%:  that was like his
0.01%:  that was more like 
0.01%:  that made things weird
0.01%:  I think we'll have to write
0.01%:  I made the sem
0.01%:  it's me who writes the
0.01%:  words have
0.01%:  isn't he
0.01%:  it's either the
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well eat
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to give
0.01%:  this will make him even
0.01%:  who knows what'
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well add in
0.01%:  it's more like how he made
0.01%:  he's had like 
0.01%:  I wrote that while we'
0.01%:  it's more like he's a side
0.01%:  wait I mis
0.01%:  right now I'd settle
0.01%:  what it did was solve
0.01%:  all he did was make some clever
0.01%:  I'm glad this didn
0.01%:  I'll admit it's the
0.01%:  I'm kinda tired so
0.01%:  wait that makes me
0.01%:  it's less weird
0.01%:  the latter has
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that this
0.01%:  it's called time
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's kind
0.01%:  I'd love to see where
0.01%:  I'd love to see where this leads
0.01%:  we don't live
0.01%:  the w
0.01%:  what he did was some
0.01%:  it's kinda well
0.01%:  I'll admit this might
0.01%:  I'd still like him to come
0.01%:  what it's made him is well
0.01%:  we'll give him his title
0.01%:  it's more like I've added
0.01%:  I'm taking some
0.01%:  this song will
0.01%:  he never did the
0.01%:  it's the world we wish
0.06%:  it's the world we wish we lived in;
0.03%:  it's the world we wish we lived in!!
0.02%:  it's the world we wish we lived in; we
0.01%:  that's his grave
0.01%:  that never made
0.01%:  what I've done with
0.01%:  it's read like
0.01%:  it's him who's a
0.01%:  I'd like to give credit also
0.01%:  he also liked
0.01%:  it's his work on what
0.01%:  that's a thing I made
0.01%:  it's the whole area
0.01%:  I liked how
0.01%:  he was more active
0.01%:  where'd he get
0.01%:  there's a math
0.01%:  he's still there
0.01%:  it's killed
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last time we had
0.01%:  we've all agreed that it's the second
0.01%:  all it

0.01%:  I think we're headed
0.01%:  what I've said makes him
0.01%:  it gives him the name
0.01%:  that's all I've got with me;

0.01%:  it's more that he's making
0.01%:  here's what'
0.01%:  it's the latter'
0.01%:  it's more like in

0.01%:  that's what we're called
0.01%:  he's given the award

0.01%:  that threw
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we have
0.01%:  that's all I ever wanted

0.02%:  I don't see how we'll ever decide this
0.01%:  all I've done is write the ch
0.01%:  he's more dead
0.01%:  I lied he was

0.01%:  I think he's at
0.01%:  it's a cr
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's like the
0.01%:  this is a weird seg
0.01%:  I've made all those
0.01%:  I've made all those words
0.01%:  he's dead and I'
0.01%:  it's not real
0.01%:  it's so weird when

0.01%:  it's hard to tell who did
0.01%:  I've listed him
0.02%:  I've listed him twice
0.03%:  I've listed him twice there
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we've got
0.01%:  this is a work
0.01%:  I think there's a middle
0.01%:  we all got
0.01%:  I know it's a
0.01%:  it's how we
0.01%:  I can't tell what
0.02%:  I can't tell what'
0.04%:  I can't tell what's worse
0.01%:  I can't tell what's more
0.01%:  it's more like I'm having
0.01%:  it's more than
0.01%:  that's like the worse
0.01%:  his main
0.03%:  his main work
0.01%:  I think we have a
0.01%:  it's kinda great how the
0.01%:  that's the wrong side
0.01%:  it's more like he's coming
0.01%:  he's still alive and did some
0.04%:  he's still alive and did some work
0.01%:  I'd still like to see a
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've made some
0.01%:  since it's the
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's said
0.01%:  there's not like
0.01%:  I think we'll have to go
0.01%:  that's where I'd
0.02%:  that's where I'd like
0.02%:  that's where I'd like to go
0.01%:  that's where I'd like to leave
0.01%:  that's where I'd like to end
0.01%:  I'd change
0.01%:  that's less awesome
0.01%:  let's make him
0.01%:  it's more like he's the single dad
0.01%:  he's given credit to
0.01%:  he's never asked me what I'
0.01%:  he's never asked me what I'd
0.01%:  this is the worst sem
0.01%:  I think he's made me
0.01%:  I think we've all made more
0.01%:  what I've said there is not
0.01%:  that's his second
0.01%:  there's like a decade'
0.01%:  it makes the
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added some things
0.01%:  it's tragic
0.01%:  that makes less
0.01%:  I might've said that twice
0.01%:  it's made the
0.01%:  it's all I think
0.01%:  what he did was write down two
0.01%:  that's kinda how we got
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll get
0.01%:  I'd like to change it
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; what
0.01%:  that's kinda weird that we'd
0.01%:  we all know he's dead
0.01%:  he gets his own
0.01%:  it's hard to know what came
0.01%:  wait this song
0.01%:  since I've
0.01%:  I'd like to hear him give
0.01%:  it's made him the leader
0.01%:  that's so weird I
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I've got
0.01%:  I'm a little tired
0.01%:  I think the award'
0.01%:  I think the award's called
0.01%:  it's his dis
0.01%:  he likes it when we
0.01%:  it's got him called
0.01%:  it has made him world
0.01%:  these were all things I made
0.01%:  I'd like to have that
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well add to
0.01%:  while we're at it I've got the
0.01%:  I think it was me who made
0.01%:  that's sem
0.01%:  while I've got him
0.01%:  that's like the worst seg
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd still have
0.01%:  that's still where we'
0.01%:  it's weird that we call the
0.01%:  I don't work with
0.01%:  that makes me wish we didn
0.01%:  I might've word
0.01%:  he was 
0.01%:  wait I know this
0.01%:  we call him more the
0.01%:  all he did was give it some
0.01%:  he's died like twice
0.01%:  I've kinda made him the
0.01%:  it's like he made
0.01%:  it's like hard math
0.01%:  I think it's weird to
0.01%:  I think we agreed
0.01%:  he's more like the son
0.01%:  I don't see how he'd ever
0.01%:  it's given him the same credit
0.01%:  there's this video game we
0.01%:  it seems like I
0.03%:  it seems like I've
0.01%:  these claims
0.01%:  what I did there was sing
0.01%:  I'd give it like
0.01%:  it's still weird when
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd called it
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which we give
0.01%:  I can't make it
0.01%:  I think we've messed with
0.01%:  I have to write this
0.01%:  it's the work he
0.01%:  it's the work he did in
0.01%:  I sk
0.01%:  he's still alive and this
0.01%:  he'll hate
0.01%:  it's all made him do is get
0.01%:  that's like the worst song I
0.01%:  it's making him write
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which side we
0.01%:  it's like a thing he
0.01%:  all I did here was change
0.01%:  we've kind
0.01%:  this doesn't work with a
0.01%:  I'd like to see the world live with
0.01%:  I've said all the
0.01%:  I'll let him answer
0.01%:  he's worked a lot since
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's weird how
0.01%:  I might've called
0.01%:  I might've called him
0.01%:  all I did was make him
0.01%:  wait he's dead now
0.01%:  wait where did the
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd said
0.01%:  the link is
0.01%:  he said it was the
0.01%:  mine is
0.01%:  wait it's making
0.01%:  wait it's making me sad
0.01%:  it's weird that I've said
0.01%:  that's what we've
0.03%:  that's what we've called
0.02%:  that's what we've called it
0.01%:  he like
0.01%:  he's also like
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in c
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's kinda
0.01%:  it's worth less
0.01%:  it's made him a real
0.01%:  it's like his most well
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I'm making the
0.01%:  I'm good with that
0.01%:  he's the doctor
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk since
0.01%:  his work also led
0.01%:  what it's done is made him a world
0.01%:  I'd like to see his thesis
0.01%:  I'd like to get that
0.01%:  it's made him what'
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week with
0.01%:  we've called him that in
0.01%:  it's making some
0.01%:  wow that's kind
0.01%:  he's still alive; he wrote me
0.01%:  it's weird how long
0.01%:  that last verse was
0.01%:  I've said all the right
0.01%:  I've talked him
0.01%:  that's kinda cr
0.01%:  it was asked
0.01%:  we still like him
0.01%:  he's still doing it
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how he
0.01%:  we're now
0.01%:  no it's still
0.01%:  I think he's died twice
0.01%:  all I did was edit
0.01%:  he's still alive right now I
0.01%:  all I've read is the w
0.01%:  I might like this world a
0.01%:  I think he's real good
0.01%:  it's weird how it
0.01%:  it's weird how it's called
0.01%:  this is like 
0.01%:  worth
0.01%:  we made the
0.02%:  we made the whole
0.01%:  that makes him less
0.01%:  it's more like he gets his
0.01%:  we might as well admit
0.01%:  I think we've got this all
0.01%:  I'm glad that's over with; it
0.01%:  I'm glad that's over with; it was kind
0.01%:  that's the world we live in I
0.01%:  in this world I
0.02%:  in this world I've
0.02%:  in this world I've made
0.01%:  in this world I've made him
0.01%:  it's the search
0.01%:  the thing's like
0.01%:  what we have
0.01%:  I might've messed that line
0.01%:  all he did was work on the
0.01%:  we made all
0.01%:  I went with
0.01%:  I think we call the
0.01%:  while I'm still
0.01%:  we've heard that
0.01%:  when I read it the
0.01%:  it's when he said
0.01%:  it's this whole weird
0.01%:  I don't see how we get
0.01%:  how did I get this
0.01%:  that's weird!!
0.01%:  all I did there is
0.01%:  we all agree his
0.01%:  that gets worse
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's a
0.01%:  he's since died
0.01%:  that gave me the idea
0.01%:  what have we
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd called the
0.01%:  that's all I've got in here
0.01%:  it's more a thesis
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's kinda
0.01%:  it's less clear what
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in the last
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in the last week
0.01%:  I don't see what he
0.04%:  I don't see what he did
0.01%:  I've made the entire
0.01%:  I think we've all missed the real
0.01%:  I don't like this world we've made; let
0.01%:  I think it was more the
0.01%:  I've messed with
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; what'
0.01%:  wait!! I
0.01%:  all I've done is made him
0.01%:  his name's weird
0.01%:  we've agreed to call it the
0.01%:  it was given the
0.01%:  we've all agreed that he
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd solved
0.01%:  it's more that he said
0.01%:  it's all he's ever wanted to do with
0.01%:  wait I think we might
0.01%:  this led
0.01%:  he'll get mad
0.01%:  it's more like him and
0.01%:  all he did is give
0.01%:  while we're at it we'll change
0.01%:  I change
0.01%:  that'd make him two
0.01%:  it's all words
0.01%:  we don't teach
0.02%:  we don't teach him
0.01%:  he draws
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we call the
0.01%:  it's more like he's a d
0.01%:  I still think he's alive
0.01%:  I think he's weird
0.01%:  I'd watch
0.01%:  he might've made it
0.01%:  there's at
0.01%:  we call that '
0.01%:  it's making him lose
0.01%:  we know that
0.01%:  it's me who's doing
0.01%:  all I've got is this cr
0.01%:  there's video games and
0.01%:  the second word'
0.01%:  this entire w
0.01%:  that's 
0.01%:  he's making the
0.01%:  he might've named
0.01%:  all he did was like
0.01%:  was there
0.01%:  I don't have a c
0.01%:  it's what made him world
0.01%:  I've got a lot
0.01%:  it's still like 
0.01%:  it gave him the idea
0.01%:  that's what I've named
0.01%:  I've messed with the words
0.01%:  there's like all
0.01%:  I think it's his real
0.01%:  this whole time I'd meant
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that I've made
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn
0.42%:  I've heard he doesn't like it
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn't like it at
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn't like to
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn't like it so
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn't like it!!
0.01%:  it's the world we might
0.01%:  it's not clear who he is
0.01%:  that's wrong; it's his sem
0.01%:  he's alive and I
0.01%:  what it's made him is a legend
0.01%:  it's more like a legend
0.01%:  it doesn't make him do
0.01%:  we have a lot
0.01%:  I wrote this in middle
0.01%:  it's making this hard
0.01%:  I'm glad this never
0.01%:  we've worked
0.01%:  we've worked that
0.01%:  that's kinda weird; I'
0.01%:  this is the worst I've come
0.01%:  it's making me wish I read
0.01%:  I'm making these whole
0.01%:  I tried this
0.01%:  we don't have a sem
0.01%:  now that we've said it we might as well ded
0.01%:  this is the world we'd lived
0.01%:  I still like the other
0.01%:  it's more like we've made
0.01%:  he's still alive so don't write him
0.01%:  no wait he's like
0.01%:  this isn't great
0.01%:  I think we'll give him credit
0.01%:  it's kinda great how we
0.01%:  I still have some work
0.01%:  the latter's the
0.01%:  it's more like he'd made
0.01%:  what he's done is like
0.01%:  the idea is
0.01%:  he's still alive; I added
0.01%:  there's video game
0.01%:  he's got his own w
0.01%:  that's it;
0.01%:  we think he'd
0.01%:  we might as well re
0.01%:  I think he claims
0.01%:  I hate him
0.01%:  there's a video game I made with
0.01%:  it's like all the words
0.01%:  we're still doing the same
0.01%:  now I've made it
0.01%:  I'd like to review
0.01%:  it's making me all
0.01%:  it's like the worst named
0.01%:  this is me who
0.01%:  this is me who wrote
0.01%:  what's weird is when
0.01%:  the award'
0.01%:  the award's called
0.01%:  I think he's made it clear
0.01%:  I think it was some
0.01%:  it's like the worst thing I'm
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's making me decide
0.01%:  he worked with some
0.01%:  th
0.01%:  what I did there is made
0.01%:  I don't get what's with all
0.01%:  it's like a 
0.01%:  I'd like to give the last line credit
0.01%:  there isn't like
0.01%:  I'd never call him a god
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; we got
0.01%:  I'd like to leave
0.01%:  we've had a lot
0.01%:  all I know is his
0.01%:  all these words make
0.01%:  he's still alive at
0.01%:  I kinda wrote the
0.01%:  this was the work
0.01%:  he's real alive
0.01%:  that's the second sem
0.01%:  he kinda came
0.01%:  man this
0.01%:  he's still alive so we're making
0.01%:  I'm wrong; the
0.01%:  this was a met
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we don't like his sem
0.01%:  I made it rh
0.01%:  he gets a little
0.01%:  he gets a little credit
0.01%:  what I'd like to do is give
0.01%:  it's all we've worked
0.01%:  it's more like he's a little
0.01%:  let's wait
0.01%:  that's the s
0.01%:  we still have to decide what we're making
0.01%:  he's a racist
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever said how
0.01%:  when I read the title
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd solved that
0.01%:  this whole time I was review
0.01%:  it's like all the other
0.01%:  it's so weird I
0.01%:  it was either
0.01%:  I think that's called a
0.01%:  he called it the '
0.01%:  I still get
0.01%:  she likes it
0.01%:  we gave him his
0.02%:  we gave him his title
0.01%:  we gave him his doctor
0.01%:  wait where did I go
0.01%:  I'd love to see the
0.01%:  what it's done is get him some
0.01%:  all I did was merge
0.01%:  this doesn't work that well;
0.01%:  it made me think
0.01%:  I'm wrong; it
0.02%:  I'm wrong; it's called
0.02%:  I'm wrong; it's called the
0.01%:  I'm wrong; it's the
0.01%:  he still likes the
0.01%:  I might've read that in
0.01%:  he won't like that
0.01%:  he was given his title
0.01%:  while I'm here let
0.01%:  this is what it
0.02%:  this is what it'
0.07%:  this is what it's called
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that I've come
0.01%:  I'm making the other
0.01%:  that made me sick when
0.01%:  that made me sick when I wrote
0.01%:  I've made him this; it
0.01%:  this is all we
0.01%:  this made me throw
0.01%:  this is like the worst game
0.01%:  he's still alive; we're not
0.01%:  wait there's also
0.01%:  there's like a whole tim
0.01%:  that's me right
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've made
0.01%:  what it's made is
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's called
0.01%:  I've heard it's a
0.01%:  all he did was write a sem
0.01%:  that title
0.01%:  I've no idea who this is
0.01%:  we're adding
0.01%:  I'm 
0.01%:  I might've missed that
0.01%:  we still have to decide how
0.01%:  wait I'll
0.01%:  I'd heard he'
0.01%:  it's more like he called his
0.01%:  that's the wrong time
0.01%:  it's called the thesis
0.01%:  it's real nice
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in this
0.02%:  it's the world we lived in this week
0.01%:  I think it might've come later
0.01%:  it's like their whole
0.01%:  it's like the thing
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've got
0.01%:  can I
0.01%:  it gave rise to the class
0.01%:  I've no idea where that'
0.01%:  what I've said there'
0.01%:  he did a lot more
0.01%:  the world we live in is the same old
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we live
0.01%:  he's still alive; there
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd love to get
0.01%:  it's more like the most
0.01%:  he isn't a
0.01%:  I still like him more as
0.01%:  wait I've screw
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd called
0.01%:  this is a little
0.01%:  I think it's a met
0.01%:  the last word is like
0.01%:  where am
0.01%:  it's all he does
0.01%:  no he's like the
0.01%:  what I did there is called a
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's give him a
0.02%:  while I'm at it let's give him a second
0.01%:  I heard it's the
0.01%:  I'll admit he
0.01%:  it isn
0.02%:  it isn't called
0.01%:  what he did was coin
0.01%:  all I did there was m
0.01%:  we still have the old
0.01%:  it doesn't have to make
0.03%:  it doesn't have to make him
0.01%:  it was me who wrote all
0.01%:  that's what we call it
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's time
0.01%:  right now I'm like
0.01%:  all I did there was change some
0.01%:  I'd like to see how that
0.01%:  doesn't have
0.01%:  I've added some new
0.01%:  I've got this all mess
0.01%:  it's what'
0.04%:  it's what's called
0.02%:  it's what's called the
0.01%:  it's what's made
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's clear we
0.01%:  that's wrong; it makes him a
0.01%:  wait it's worse
0.01%:  that's where it all went
0.01%:  it's more like how he's a
0.01%:  he's talked down
0.01%:  how did we get into this mess
0.01%:  there's still math
0.01%:  he seems to have liked
0.01%:  we'll have to decide
0.01%:  we'll have to decide what
0.01%:  he doesn't do
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's now
0.01%:  it's clear that he
0.01%:  he got called
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child that'
0.01%:  it's hard to tell when we
0.01%:  it's hard to tell when we've
0.01%:  this is so great
0.01%:  we still need him
0.01%:  that's more like his claim
0.01%:  we might as well make
0.01%:  while I'm at it there
0.02%:  while I'm at it there's also
0.01%:  wait I think we're still
0.01%:  I added the sem
0.01%:  it's this great
0.01%:  it gave him credit
0.01%:  that last line is where
0.01%:  he might've worked on it
0.01%:  i wrote
0.01%:  i wrote this
0.01%:  I've seen his
0.01%:  we might have to make
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird how we
0.02%:  it's still kinda weird how we got
0.01%:  I think we've mis
0.01%:  what it's called is like
0.01%:  we still have no idea how
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he's doing
0.01%:  it's more like he showed a
0.01%:  the two aren
0.01%:  I've made him a little less
0.01%:  this whole idea's making
0.01%:  I think he's a more
0.01%:  he's like the world
0.02%:  he's like the world's oldest
0.02%:  he's like the world's most
0.02%:  he's like the world's oldest active
0.01%:  wait is this
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd solved this
0.01%:  it's like a secret
0.01%:  it's like the worse
0.01%:  it's more like he's given me
0.01%:  this made me write this
0.01%:  he's still alive so it might
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd said
0.01%:  who gives
0.02%:  who gives a shit
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dad and we
0.01%:  I'd like to watch
0.01%:  what it's made him is doctor
0.01%:  the whole '
0.01%:  that's a lot
0.01%:  this seems like the world we'd want
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in; we
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well ded
0.01%:  it's more like he's won
0.01%:  this is weird and I've
0.01%:  all he did was make it
0.01%:  I write these down
0.01%:  we'll never get
0.01%:  I think we missed that
0.01%:  this got weird when
0.01%:  it's named with
0.01%:  I did this with
0.01%:  am
0.01%:  I think we'd have to call
0.01%:  I think we all agree the
0.01%:  those last two lines were added with
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to seg
0.01%:  I do have
0.01%:  I have no idea how sem
0.01%:  I think the review
0.01%:  what I'd love
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever decide what
0.01%:  it's said that
0.01%:  I'll wait right
0.01%:  it's weird that I'm doing the
0.01%:  I think it's called 'the
0.01%:  wait he's still alive so
0.01%:  I think we've agreed
0.01%:  it's said he was
0.01%:  it's the third line
0.01%:  this might've killed
0.01%:  I'll stick to
0.01%:  he got this
0.01%:  he got this award
0.01%:  I think we're all good
0.01%:  it's like the worst movie I
0.01%:  what I think we'll do is get
0.01%:  he's still alive; we're good
0.01%:  that's a trick
0.01%:  it's hard to tell how we
0.01%:  we call those other
0.01%:  I might add
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how math
0.01%:  he likes all
0.01%:  that's all I've time
0.01%:  it's like a thing he wrote
0.01%:  it makes me wonder what he
0.02%:  it makes me wonder what he'd
0.01%:  now that'
0.01%:  it's kinda made me
0.01%:  it was in '
0.01%:  we'll leave the
0.01%:  I'd like to hear some
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in a week ago;
0.01%:  it's him who's one
0.01%:  that's all I ever knew
0.01%:  that was right
0.01%:  no I have
0.01%:  I'll write this
0.01%:  that's kinda sad
0.01%:  I'm new
0.03%:  I'm new to this whole
0.01%:  I think that's racism
0.01%:  the second verse is like
0.01%:  it's more like he was an
0.01%:  we're still living with the same
0.01%:  now that's weird
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's in
0.01%:  let's give him a
0.01%:  all the credit'
0.01%:  we've agreed that this
0.01%:  he's cool with
0.01%:  I read this whole
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how the same
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to get a
0.01%:  I don't like this world we've made with
0.01%:  I never liked the
0.01%:  that's a dick
0.01%:  I don't like that rh
0.01%:  I wish he liked
0.01%:  it's weird that I know these
0.01%:  wait a second this might
0.01%:  it's kinda tragic how he'
0.01%:  he's said he likes
0.01%:  it's the world we live in that made
0.01%:  he might've died last
0.03%:  he might've died last week
0.01%:  he's still alive and might take
0.01%:  he kinda did
0.01%:  it's kinda this
0.01%:  it's kinda this weird
0.01%:  he later said
0.01%:  it's more like he comes
0.01%:  I've made almost
0.01%:  this is all weird
0.01%:  I'd like to see what his
0.01%:  this was like the second
0.01%:  this song was like
0.01%:  I might have to stick
0.01%:  he's 
0.01%:  he's still alive and right
0.01%:  that's a lie he didn
0.01%:  he did some work in
0.01%:  he's what
0.01%:  he died last week so we're still
0.01%:  I'll give him the credit on
0.01%:  all I read
0.01%:  there's video games in the
0.02%:  there's video games in the middle
0.01%:  that name'
0.01%:  I'm glad we've sorted
0.03%:  I'm glad we've sorted this all
0.01%:  he had to write
0.01%:  he died months
0.01%:  he died this week!!
0.01%:  it was more like the 
0.01%:  it's made him what we
0.01%:  there is a slight
0.01%:  we don't have that
0.01%:  it solved
0.01%:  this is all a met
0.01%:  we might as well start
0.01%:  it's like this thing
0.06%:  it's like this thing called
0.01%:  what I did there was set
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is dis
0.01%:  this means we live
0.01%:  it's this doctor
0.01%:  it's all dead
0.03%:  it's all dead wrong
0.01%:  he had some
0.01%:  it's more like he gave it the
0.01%:  we've all agreed this was
0.01%:  now that I've said it the
0.01%:  we think it was more
0.01%:  I think he said it's called
0.01%:  I'd write it down
0.01%:  that's all he's done
0.01%:  it's all we've done
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give him two
0.01%:  I'd like to switch
0.01%:  that made it worse; I
0.02%:  that made it worse; I'
0.01%:  he's given talks where
0.01%:  I'm seeing this
0.01%:  the world we live in is what I'
0.01%:  since there's like
0.01%:  I'd like to change the world
0.01%:  it's like the word
0.01%:  there I'
0.02%:  there I'm making
0.01%:  I've made that shit
0.01%:  give me a second I'll write that
0.01%:  that's a great nick
0.01%:  it's more like having the
0.01%:  we never did get
0.01%:  I'm doing his
0.01%:  I'm doing his work
0.01%:  it's more like he did a thing
0.01%:  all I've done is write some
0.01%:  the title is called
0.01%:  I kinda threw the
0.01%:  this line was
0.01%:  this line was added
0.01%:  he did that in
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is mess
0.01%:  there's still active
0.01%:  he's dead so it's kinda tragic
0.01%:  I think he was dead
0.01%:  I'd rate him second
0.01%:  it's the worst idea I've had in
0.02%:  it's the worst idea I've had in weeks
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week; we
0.01%:  I gave him the title
0.01%:  we live in the same world I
0.01%:  we call him god
0.01%:  it's more like his 
0.01%:  it's now a
0.01%:  this made me sick
0.01%:  I made the whole second
0.01%:  it seems like this whole
0.01%:  wait we've got
0.01%:  I think that's a good
0.01%:  it's more like what we
0.02%:  it's more like what we call
0.01%:  he's still alive and I'm screw
0.01%:  I've added those last three
0.01%:  don't tell him I'
0.01%:  his name might'
0.01%:  it was mat
0.01%:  we'll give that award
0.01%:  what he did was re
0.01%:  it's more like his dad's the
0.01%:  I'd like to see him called
0.01%:  it was when he asked
0.01%:  I chose the
0.01%:  I've got like two
0.01%:  there's a cool
0.01%:  I'm right
0.01%:  what I've said is like
0.01%:  I'll admit it's more like
0.01%:  I drew that
0.01%:  this shows
0.01%:  what's weird is this
0.01%:  he's still kinda active
0.01%:  wait I'm like
0.01%:  he can
0.01%:  we're all a
0.01%:  this'll make more
0.01%:  here's what it's called
0.01%:  it's all he's good
0.01%:  he's tried
0.01%:  he said it's called
0.01%:  it's still the worst
0.01%:  I wrote this down with
0.01%:  it's all he's ever done with
0.01%:  we've all agreed to stick with the old names
0.01%:  I'd call it more the
0.01%:  I've no idea how right
0.01%:  it'll make him a
0.01%:  it's me who's made the
0.01%:  that's what makes
0.01%:  he seems like a nice
0.01%:  it was like two words
0.01%:  that's legal
0.01%:  it's like the most awesome thing ever!!
0.01%:  it's the same word in
0.01%:  that's kinda awesome!!
0.01%:  I'd call him the grand
0.01%:  he calls his
0.01%:  he calls his work
0.01%:  he gave his sem
0.01%:  we think we
0.01%:  he gave it his
0.01%:  it's what he's more
0.01%:  what I've said makes it
0.01%:  so have
0.01%:  he made this work
0.01%:  some might
0.01%:  that's the single worst
0.01%:  ever since 
0.01%:  this was kinda
0.01%:  I've said all these
0.02%:  I've said all these words twice
0.02%:  I've said all these things
0.01%:  I've got all these
0.01%:  all I've done is switch the
0.01%:  it's more like he's gone
0.01%:  now that I've said the word twice
0.01%:  we've made the
0.01%:  it was re
0.01%:  when I said '
0.01%:  it was like the third most
0.01%:  it ended
0.01%:  we'll change that
0.01%:  now that I've tried
0.01%:  he's still alive so this
0.01%:  I che
0.01%:  this makes me wonder who
0.01%:  he might've worked in
0.01%:  what does
0.01%:  what do
0.01%:  we never got
0.01%:  it makes him the world's least
0.01%:  I might have wrote
0.01%:  it's called more things
0.01%:  his work was on time
0.01%:  I'll leave it right
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's alive
0.01%:  closer
0.01%:  he'd never eat
0.01%:  it's so weird how
0.01%:  it's made him a well
0.01%:  I think we've messed this
0.01%:  that is his
0.01%:  now that I've said his
0.01%:  he's still alive so we need
0.01%:  I think the idea
0.01%:  this is where I decide
0.01%:  it's more like a '
0.01%:  it's like this long
0.01%:  he denied
0.01%:  there we
0.01%:  we talked
0.01%:  I think the '
0.01%:  there's a video game called the
0.01%:  he still likes it when
0.01%:  I'd like to write that
0.01%:  what it's made me is
0.01%:  that reads like the
0.01%:  it's made him so
0.01%:  when he'
0.01%:  wrote this
0.01%:  that seemed like it
0.01%:  that seemed like it might
0.01%:  it's a movie where
0.01%:  I've made that line
0.01%:  I think he's dead or
0.01%:  this is over
0.01%:  it makes him a child
0.01%:  I wrote this like eight
0.01%:  while I'm here can
0.01%:  we think his real
0.01%:  he still has
0.01%:  he more likes
0.01%:  I'm making this word
0.01%:  he tried to solve
0.01%:  it's the second!!
0.01%:  I cried
0.01%:  I've said this wrong;
0.01%:  it's what it's named
0.01%:  the term'
0.01%:  we wrote this while
0.01%:  I wish he'd never come
0.01%:  that's the world we didn
0.01%:  now I've said it there
0.01%:  what I'm doing is the
0.01%:  I've heard he's still
0.01%:  this is all I've got so
0.01%:  it's more like high
0.01%:  it's weird how he got
0.01%:  he did write that down
0.01%:  it's a real thing I
0.01%:  it's a real thing I'
0.01%:  it's like when I was
0.01%:  all he did was work with
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it was
0.01%:  it's wrong to call it
0.01%:  it's more like he's d
0.01%:  that's the worst we
0.02%:  that's the worst we've done
0.01%:  that's the worst we've come
0.01%:  that's where I live
0.01%:  now I'm sad
0.01%:  it's more like his last
0.01%:  this is how we talk
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've all come
0.01%:  I liked the idea
0.01%:  I made the thing
0.01%:  that's like the least weird
0.01%:  he claims he didn
0.01%:  this is hor
0.01%:  this is all I've wanted
0.01%:  he said he liked gr
0.01%:  it's more him asking
0.01%:  I think it's more what
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well the
0.01%:  this isn't the world I
0.01%:  we don't have time to get
0.01%:  I'd need
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk!!
0.01%:  I heard he died
0.01%:  what I'm seeing
0.01%:  I'll admit he's more
0.01%:  I think we've made a mess
0.01%:  I'd like more
0.01%:  that's wrong he
0.01%:  I made him write his
0.01%:  what he said was '
0.01%:  he's still alive and he worked it
0.01%:  I've made him all the
0.01%:  the game is
0.01%:  he never asked me what
0.01%:  I wish we were still doing the
0.01%:  that's where I'm taking
0.01%:  it's weird how well the
0.01%:  it's given him credit
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's more
0.01%:  I've no idea what his degree
0.01%: ; it
0.01%: ; it's called
0.01%:  it's like the world's oldest active
0.01%:  I'm done here
0.01%:  I'd like to throw
0.01%:  it's more like the middle class
0.01%:  I've drawn this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is over with
0.01%:  he was a kid
0.01%:  now that I've said it this
0.01%:  we don't call it the
0.01%:  he's still with me
0.01%:  it's almost like he
0.01%:  we don't like this
0.01%:  it has made me
0.01%:  I might've added a line
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd read this
0.01%:  the list
0.01%:  he's still alive; I didn
0.01%:  that's kinda where we get
0.01%:  I've got these
0.01%:  this second
0.01%:  it's him who gets all
0.01%:  how did we get there
0.01%:  it's awesome how
0.01%:  it's mess
0.01%:  it's the worst thing I've made
0.01%:  all I've done is switch the word
0.01%:  I'd heard his
0.01%:  what he asked is
0.01%:  wait let
0.01%:  it's less weird when
0.01%:  it's re
0.01%:  it gave the
0.01%:  it gave the world
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as it'
0.02%:  that doesn't work as well as it'd
0.01%:  it's more like I'll
0.01%:  all I know is he was
0.01%:  it's more like he got called
0.01%:  it's wrong to call him that
0.01%:  I might've dream
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how we
0.01%:  wait let'
0.01%:  it gives me the will
0.01%:  we think it's called the
0.01%:  it's making me real sad
0.01%:  this was a thing
0.01%:  the second term
0.01%:  we're doing this with
0.01%:  who even
0.01%:  what I've done there is take
0.01%:  we've all agreed with
0.01%:  that's weird I didn
0.01%:  I'd like to clear this
0.01%:  he was a doctor
0.01%:  I think we'd all have
0.01%:  this might've ended
0.01%:  he was asking the
0.01%:  we don't have the word
0.01%:  that made him even
0.01%:  it's more like he's the co
0.01%:  I'm kinda scared this
0.02%:  I'm kinda scared this might
0.01%:  we all get
0.01%: !! I
0.01%:  his work's made
0.01%:  he's still alive and I worked
0.01%:  this is what I've wanted
0.01%:  the world we live in was made
0.01%:  it's more like things
0.01%:  this is where I went
0.01%:  he's still alive and did work
0.01%:  that might've worked a
0.01%:  I made the rh
0.01%:  I seem to have missed
0.01%:  I've no idea what the world
0.01%:  we've had that since
0.01%:  wait I'm having some
0.01%:  that was me making
0.01%:  there it
0.01%:  it's like there's no
0.01%:  I know it's the
0.01%:  there's like twice
0.01%:  that's where I went
0.01%:  I think he'll go
0.01%:  we're all having
0.01%:  his name is the
0.01%:  it's more like what I'm
0.02%:  it's more like what I'm doing
0.01%:  I'm having a hard time dec
0.01%:  there's still a lot we have
0.01%:  it's more like he's to
0.01%:  he'd never claim
0.01%:  let's all agree we
0.01%:  I gave the
0.01%:  I'm not clear what
0.01%:  it's weird how close these
0.01%:  we're good with this
0.01%:  he did not write the
0.01%:  it's making me sad!!
0.01%:  it's called other things like
0.01%:  it's twelve
0.01%:  now that I've said it there's like 
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell these
0.01%:  that's all I've got down there
0.01%:  his work is what led
0.01%:  all I did was change the words to
0.01%:  I think it's clever how
0.01%:  I'm making that sh
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time; it's a
0.01%:  I'd still give
0.01%:  all I did here was take
0.01%:  he was more like the mid
0.01%:  he made me write that down
0.01%:  it's all he's ever said
0.01%:  that makes them
0.01%:  what he did is solved
0.01%:  I'd settle
0.01%:  it made him well
0.01%:  I made the other
0.01%:  while he did work
0.01%:  that'd make him twice
0.01%:  give me a sec I
0.02%:  give me a sec I think
0.01%:  that's weird and I've
0.01%:  what he's done is give
0.01%:  I'd never called
0.02%:  I'd never called him
0.01%:  this song is called '
0.01%:  it's where he made
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he gets called the
0.01%:  this has got
0.01%:  it's more that he's kind
0.01%:  I've had this idea since
0.01%:  he's never met
0.01%:  this is like the worst idea I
0.03%:  this is like the worst idea I've come
0.01%:  this is now where
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well twice
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in as
0.01%:  it's hard to have
0.01%:  what's the word I
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it makes
0.01%:  it's single
0.01%:  the latter is his nick
0.01%:  what he did was review
0.01%:  what he did was review some
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time; it was
0.01%:  it's not clear we've
0.02%:  it's not clear we've made
0.01%:  I might have kind
0.01%:  it's making him the doctor
0.01%:  he was also
0.01%:  I might have lied a
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed with
0.01%:  that's all I've got while
0.01%:  that's more like what we
0.01%:  his kids named their
0.01%:  it's what we call it when we talk
0.01%:  I've said this twice now;
0.01%:  he did his work at
0.01%:  it's a video game now where
0.01%:  no it's more
0.02%:  no it's more like he
0.02%:  no it's more like he's the
0.02%:  no it's more like he was
0.02%:  no it's more like he's a
0.01%:  this does seem
0.01%:  this was a trick
0.01%:  I still think he's a great
0.01%:  it gets worse when we
0.01%:  we all agree that this
0.01%:  I think he was over
0.01%:  I made this song
0.01%:  he seems like he was
0.01%:  I might've taken this
0.01%:  now that we've said it I
0.02%:  now that we've said it I'
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I've made this
0.01%:  it's weird how I can
0.01%:  that makes me wonder who'
0.01%:  it's tragic how
0.01%:  I'm wrong that
0.01%:  I'm wrong that was
0.01%:  I'm wrong that's his
0.01%:  I've not read his sem
0.01%:  he worked on it
0.01%:  we've all since agreed it's the
0.01%:  it's all those
0.01%:  he had more
0.01%:  I don't like what
0.01%:  wait that's a weird
0.01%:  wait that's a weird thing
0.01%:  that doesn't work as a lim
0.01%:  he's more like a dad who
0.01%:  this has given me ideas
0.01%:  this whole idea's kinda
0.01%:  he did work on the
0.01%:  that's like the cool
0.01%:  I think we all have
0.01%:  what I think we'll do is we
0.01%:  it's more like how we
0.01%:  ignore this
0.01%:  that's all we've got in
0.01%:  it's what it's called!!
0.01%:  it's more like he's given it
0.01%:  we still have to decide who
0.01%:  the last line makes
0.01%:  it's more like how he came
0.01%:  this gives me new
0.01%:  it's weird that he's called a god
0.01%:  this is how I'll
0.01%:  it's me who's said all
0.01%:  it's all I've read this
0.01%:  I think we'll save
0.01%:  we've heard this song
0.01%:  there's a twist
0.01%:  all I did was stick
0.01%:  it seems like he might
0.01%:  now that I've said his middle
0.01%:  isn't that weird
0.01%:  it showed
0.01%:  we've all worked on the
0.01%:  I wrote like
0.01%:  it's still the same world we've
0.01%:  that's a lie I've
0.01%:  I've made him think
0.01%:  in terms
0.01%:  he's like three
0.01%:  I wish he'd given
0.01%:  I was like
0.01%:  that's like the worst sl
0.01%:  all it's made him is dead
0.01%:  all I did was merge two
0.01%:  I'm aware that'
0.01%:  while we're at it can we give him
0.01%:  that's wrong; we've
0.01%:  I hate when
0.01%:  that's like all the
0.03%:  that's like all the words
0.01%:  I added the last three
0.01%:  that last line might make
0.01%:  he did make some
0.01%:  this made me wish
0.02%:  this made me wish I'd never
0.02%:  this made me wish I'd never asked
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm kinda
0.01%:  this makes me sad now
0.01%:  he's more like a middle aged
0.01%:  we don't like that
0.01%:  I'll admit it right
0.01%:  that was weird when
0.01%:  he's asked me
0.01%:  don't ask me where that
0.01%:  we still think he's a
0.01%:  it's called either the
0.01%:  it made him decide
0.01%:  he's still alive and he came
0.01%:  he's also a
0.01%:  no we've
0.01%:  his middle name's '
0.01%:  all we know is that he died
0.01%:  we're still doing the whole
0.01%:  he still likes math
0.01%:  I'm making his title
0.01%:  it's like he's the dad
0.01%:  I've no idea how his
0.01%:  it's hard to talk while I'm moving
0.01%:  all I did was sing
0.01%:  it was more like the '
0.01%:  I think we've all missed his
0.01%:  this is still the
0.03%:  this is still the world we'
0.01%:  this is still the world we've
0.01%:  I'll admit there's a
0.01%:  since he's still alive he gets
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's more
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well write down
0.01%:  I've got no idea where this is all
0.01%:  he's still great
0.01%:  I'll read
0.01%:  I think he's mad
0.01%:  I've almost
0.01%:  I've got some ideas
0.01%:  I think we've made all
0.01%:  it's more like how he's made
0.01%:  I've no idea who his sem
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is disc
0.01%:  he had never
0.01%:  it's weird that he's one
0.01%:  he's still alive and gets mad
0.01%:  he's so great
0.01%:  it's more like he's dated
0.01%:  the world we lived in was awesome
0.01%:  thank
0.01%:  we've all tried
0.01%:  that's kinda cool
0.01%:  it's more me
0.01%:  it's more me who
0.01%:  I don't like this tim
0.01%:  wait this is wrong I
0.01%:  wait this is wrong I'
0.01%:  this is a review
0.01%:  it's weird he's called the
0.01%:  this is the second time I've asked
0.01%:  I'm making the last two
0.02%:  I'm making the last two words
0.01%:  it's the latter he
0.01%:  I'd like to see how well this
0.01%:  wait where did I get all
0.02%:  wait where did I get all these
0.01%:  we are still
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this world
0.01%:  how'd that
0.01%:  I'd still like to see the answer
0.01%:  it's weird when I talk
0.01%:  I'd give him like
0.01%:  he did call
0.01%:  I think the last word
0.01%:  I think the last word was
0.01%:  it's a c
0.01%:  all I have
0.01%:  I'd hate
0.01%:  the latter's his nick
0.01%:  that's all I've got now
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is how we live
0.01%:  I think we'd have to credit
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd solved these
0.01%:  I'd like the world to live
0.01%:  I don't like his sem
0.01%:  there's a school
0.01%:  the right
0.01%:  his work led to him
0.01%:  it's weird that I'm making these
0.01%:  it made him all
0.01%:  we can all
0.01%:  it's like the worst game
0.01%:  I'll make
0.01%:  we'd have
0.01%:  I'd like to go with
0.01%:  he also came
0.01%:  wait this is making me sad
0.01%:  what he did was wonder
0.01%:  we've had these
0.01%:  it's a real thing he did!!
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he cares
0.01%:  when I saw
0.02%:  when I saw the word
0.01%:  he's given that
0.01%:  it'll take me a while to write
0.01%:  that's making a
0.01%:  it's a little weird how his
0.01%:  we don't allow
0.01%:  I think we'll leave him
0.01%:  it's his most well
0.01%:  it's his thesis
0.01%:  let's not give
0.23%:  let's not give him credit
0.01%:  let's not give him the
0.03%:  let's not give him the credit
0.01%:  let's not give him a
0.01%:  that gives him two
0.01%:  there's like a whole sem
0.01%:  we give
0.04%:  we give the award
0.03%:  we give the credit
0.02%:  we give the award to the
0.01%:  we give the award to him
0.01%:  we give the award to his
0.01%:  that still
0.02%:  that still makes
0.01%:  that still works
0.01%:  it's still the sem
0.01%:  math is hard
0.01%:  I've messed with the word
0.01%:  I think we missed a com
0.01%:  it's like he was the
0.01%:  I think he's all
0.01%:  I'd like to remove
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it's time
0.01%:  I gave him that middle
0.01%:  he is more well
0.01%:  he said his
0.01%:  I don't get how he came
0.01%:  I'm wrong this is all
0.01%:  I think he still lives
0.01%:  I'll have to work
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as I might
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd read
0.01%:  I can't tell how
0.01%:  I think there's a miss
0.01%:  it's still locked
0.01%:  he died this week so I
0.01%:  I made the last words
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd never called
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well do
0.01%:  we've gotten
0.01%:  he never did come
0.01%:  that's the review
0.01%:  we're losing the
0.01%:  it'll make more
0.01%:  I've added the last two
0.01%:  I've added the last two lines there
0.01%:  I've lost where
0.01%:  I think that was me
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well ask
0.01%:  there's a movie called '
0.01%:  it's still the second
0.01%:  we call him things like '
0.01%:  we'll change the word
0.01%:  all I'm doing is rem
0.01%:  this is like a
0.01%:  he's dead since like
0.01%:  that song'
0.01%:  it's more like a dad thing
0.01%:  it's making the world'
0.01%:  that song is
0.01%:  it's more like he's a single
0.01%:  he named it the
0.01%:  that's how we'
0.01%:  he's a god
0.01%:  that's a little weird and
0.01%:  I wish he'd done
0.01%:  he won't let
0.03%:  he won't let me call
0.01%:  he won't let me call it
0.01%:  he won't let me call his
0.03%:  he won't let me call his work
0.01%:  I think he's more alive
0.01%:  it's given his work
0.01%:  I wrote it this
0.01%:  he still works on
0.01%:  what I'm doing is r
0.01%: !! I think
0.01%:  we still have like eight
0.01%:  I did all this work
0.01%:  it makes me throw
0.01%:  it's making me wish we were all
0.01%:  it's the world we live in so I
0.01%:  it's the world we live in so I'
0.01%:  I don't see how we ever
0.01%:  this made me wish I'd gone
0.01%:  it's a term I
0.01%:  that line was added
0.01%:  I think we've made it clear this
0.01%:  it's kinda how he came
0.01%:  I've got no idea what he was
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in two
0.19%:  this was the world we lived in two weeks
0.01%:  he's still awesome either
0.01%:  that's like the world's l
0.01%:  we're still at the stage
0.01%:  I'd ask him to sign
0.01%:  he's like that
0.01%:  it made him so
0.01%:  it's me who's said all these
0.01%:  it's called linear
0.01%:  this is now the world we've all died
0.01%:  what we call the
0.01%:  we've got him
0.01%:  we've got him listed
0.01%:  all we've done with
0.01%:  the awards
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he'd ever
0.01%:  while we're at it let's move the
0.01%:  we think the word
0.01%:  he's still a great
0.01%:  I'd call this more
0.01%:  it made me write this song
0.01%:  I might have talked
0.01%:  it's the world we've chosen
0.01%:  I'll have to write the
0.01%:  let's re
0.01%:  this is how I'd write
0.01%:  we think he's called
0.01%:  that's the world we'd like to live in!!
0.01%:  it's weird how we talk
0.01%:  I wish he were dead
0.01%:  it's more like when he said
0.01%:  there's a semi
0.01%:  all he did was write down two
0.01%:  wait that's wrong we
0.01%:  that makes me wish I were
0.01%:  while I've got his
0.01%:  I wrote this lim
0.01%:  it's worth a whole
0.01%:  that one was
0.01%:  wait no I
0.02%:  wait no I'
0.01%:  wait no I've
0.01%:  he made it with
0.01%:  I've called this
0.01%:  what I'd like to do with
0.01%:  that's never come
0.01%:  this is where it all
0.01%:  this is where it all goes
0.01%:  I wrote that while doing
0.01%:  we've still gotta
0.01%:  it's not clear how we'll get
0.01%:  I'm still kinda gross
0.01%:  what's wrong with me I
0.01%:  it's weird that when
0.01%:  I wish he'd made me
0.01%:  this is all I'd
0.01%:  I've made the title
0.01%:  we've got like a
0.01%:  we've got like a whole
0.01%:  class
0.01%:  I'd like to see him do
0.01%:  this isn't the world we've
0.01%:  it was me who did this
0.01%:  don't ask me how this
0.01%:  I'd like to read the
0.01%:  that's the worst we've made
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he got called
0.01%:  we've all agreed to stick with this
0.01%:  it's more like video
0.01%:  it's more like video games and
0.01%:  it's more like video game
0.01%:  it's more like video games with
0.01%:  I wrote this at
0.01%:  I think we'd still have
0.01%:  wait a second there
0.05%:  wait a second there's like
0.02%:  wait a second there's like twelve
0.01%:  wait a second there's like 
0.01%:  I still have no idea how
0.01%:  I wrote them
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's too
0.01%:  it's like there's this
0.01%:  this is all right
0.01%:  it's making all
0.01%:  I'll give him that
0.01%:  that gives him a
0.01%:  he's like two
0.01%:  I've got the title
0.01%:  here's what I did
0.01%:  we've all since agreed this
0.01%:  it's more like met
0.01%:  I still kinda wish
0.01%:  the latter is what
0.01%:  that's the weak
0.01%:  it has made him well
0.01%:  now that we've said it we'd
0.01%:  what I wrote was the
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed it's a
0.01%:  that's all I'd
0.05%:  that's all I'd like
0.01%:  while we're at it the second
0.01%:  it's the nick
0.01%:  that's a lie; we'
0.02%:  that's a lie; we're still
0.01%:  that's a lie; we've
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in; I'
0.01%:  all we've done with this
0.01%:  I've no idea where this comes
0.01%:  it's more like this was
0.01%:  he's given the title
0.01%:  he gave it that
0.01%:  I made those last words
0.01%:  it's hard to even decide
0.02%:  it's hard to even decide what'
0.01%:  he wrote it all
0.01%:  that line made me throw
0.01%:  wait I was wrong
0.01%:  it's over 
0.01%:  I kinda messed the
0.01%:  wait he's more like
0.01%:  it was like seven words
0.01%:  that's the worst I've come
0.01%:  this has kind
0.01%:  it's the world's oldest active
0.01%:  he's still alive so I made
0.01%:  I've got no idea what that'
0.05%:  I've got no idea what that's like
0.01%:  what he did was to
0.01%:  I might have cried
0.01%:  I think we made this
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've got this
0.01%:  I wrote that while we walked
0.01%:  it's more like that's his
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's making
0.01%:  I'd like him to write the
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this goes and
0.01%:  while I'm at it there's some
0.01%:  it's more like a thesis
0.01%:  it was when he was twelve
0.01%:  I still hate
0.01%:  no it's like the
0.01%:  that was a clever
0.01%:  I'd still like to hear him
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed to switch
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm making this
0.01%:  he's still alive and he'd get
0.01%:  it's still the same degree
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in; seems
0.01%:  it's clear the
0.01%:  he was asked to give the
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like the world we've
0.01%:  the idea came to him
0.01%:  I can't get over how this is
0.01%:  the title was '
0.01%:  it doesn't make a
0.01%:  it doesn't make a whole
0.01%:  we've called his
0.01%:  the math's wrong
0.01%:  what it's done is killed
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what we've
0.01%:  all I did was merge the
0.01%:  we had a
0.01%:  it's more like I'm doing
0.01%:  there's his
0.01%:  this seems like more
0.01%:  I think what made
0.01%:  wait we're all
0.01%:  credit
0.01%:  credit goes
0.01%:  what I'd like to see solved is what
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who is
0.01%:  we had that wrong
0.01%:  we still don't give
0.02%:  we still don't give him
0.03%:  we still don't give him credit
0.01%:  he gave it the more
0.01%:  that's its
0.01%:  all I did was mess
0.03%:  all I did was mess with the words
0.02%:  all I did was mess with the word
0.01%:  he's too
0.01%:  that's a little wrong
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also give this
0.01%:  I'd like to see him write that
0.01%:  it's more like who
0.01%:  it's taken me this
0.02%:  it's taken me this whole
0.01%:  it's called things with more
0.01%:  what is this
0.01%:  I think he missed a com
0.01%:  that's all I've got this
0.07%:  that's all I've got this week
0.01%:  that makes him worse
0.01%:  there was this kid
0.01%:  I like this new world we have
0.01%:  we still think he's great
0.01%:  that made it worse; we'll
0.01%:  I'm sorta making it
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with each
0.01%:  this is all we'
0.02%:  this is all we're doing
0.02%:  this is all we've
0.04%:  this is all we've talked
0.01%:  it's not clear how he liked
0.01%:  it's made me think
0.01%:  I know he was
0.01%:  give me a sec while
0.01%:  what it's doing
0.01%:  it's all we're doing these
0.01%:  it's like a whole new
0.01%:  I've got his thesis
0.01%:  were
0.01%:  it's he
0.01%:  it's he who
0.01%:  that was all wrong
0.01%:  I'd like to write the
0.01%:  what he did was more like coming
0.01%:  wait no that's like
0.01%:  I've got no idea what's with
0.01%:  it's this doctor'
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd solved it
0.01%:  he wrote it while st
0.01%:  it's making him a lot
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's now
0.01%:  it's more like that's how
0.01%:  what I'd love is
0.01%:  it's weird that we don't have like
0.01%:  I think we'll leave it right
0.01%:  this is a thing I'
0.02%:  this is a thing I've made
0.01%:  this is a thing I'm
0.01%:  what's it like to have
0.01%:  it's hard to divide
0.01%:  he wrote some
0.01%:  we'd call him more
0.01%:  it's right in
0.01%:  it never said
0.01%:  I'd ask him to write
0.01%:  no I lied
0.01%:  called that
0.01%:  I've now said
0.01%:  I think he's dad
0.01%:  it made him rich
0.01%:  it doesn't get
0.01%:  we think he's still alive;
0.01%:  we gave him that middle
0.01%:  time
0.02%:  time travel
0.01%:  I'm so tired
0.01%:  he might've died in
0.01%:  he's still alive now
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd have
0.01%:  that's '
0.01%:  I've wasted
0.01%:  we call the other
0.01%:  we don't care what he liked
0.01%:  that might've ended
0.01%:  what it's done is make the
0.02%:  what it's done is make the world
0.01%:  he's making this
0.01%:  it's me who made it
0.01%:  he was like this
0.01%:  it'd make sense
0.01%:  that's still weird even
0.01%:  the last thing'
0.01%:  the world we lived in was the
0.01%:  it's his last
0.01%:  we have a term
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm adding the last
0.01%:  it was the second sem
0.01%:  I'd like to see him have
0.01%:  that's all I'm coming
0.01%:  there still
0.01%:  it's made him that twice over
0.01%:  he said he'd like
0.01%:  I think there's a small
0.01%:  all it's done is give him some
0.01%:  that's kinda where it
0.01%:  that's kinda where it comes
0.01%:  I lied; this is the
0.11%:  I lied; this is the world we live
0.05%:  I lied; this is the world we'
0.02%:  I lied; this is the world we'd
0.01%:  the world was like this even
0.01%:  I still kind
0.01%:  this makes me wish we'd called
0.01%:  this is kinda awesome
0.01%:  this little
0.01%:  he's a dick
0.01%:  I've called him the wrong
0.01%:  that's making him a
0.01%:  I think it's called some
0.01%:  I'll give him credit on
0.01%:  it's weird he didn
0.01%:  that's still me
0.01%:  the real title
0.02%:  the real title was
0.01%:  all he did was give an
0.01%:  what I'm doing is a
0.01%:  it's weird how that makes me
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this ends
0.01%:  wait where'd I
0.02%:  wait where'd I get this
0.02%:  wait where'd I get the
0.02%:  wait where'd I get the second
0.01%:  wait where'd I get that second
0.01%:  we like the
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this talk time
0.01%:  this is what we called
0.01%:  I think we've lost his
0.01%:  we lost
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm taking
0.01%:  all I know is he's a
0.01%:  I asked him to write it
0.01%:  now that we've said it'
0.01%:  when I wrote it
0.01%:  it's still more like
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem right I've made
0.01%:  we've all agreed on
0.01%:  I've said his name right
0.02%:  I've said his name right twice
0.01%:  I lied; there was
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work well at
0.01%:  it's when I
0.01%:  it's like when he
0.01%:  that's what I said
0.01%:  that's where I made
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little we've got
0.01%:  what I'd like right now is a cold
0.01%:  there's even
0.01%:  he's still alive; the doctor
0.01%:  he'd said
0.01%:  that's all I've got; this is weird
0.01%:  I'm the one who called
0.01%:  that makes it seem
0.01%:  that's the same word
0.03%:  that's the same word twice
0.01%:  he's still alive and the word
0.01%:  this made me write down
0.01%:  that's like the most weird
0.01%:  I am making it
0.01%:  this line is
0.01%:  all I did was give the
0.01%:  the whole song
0.01%:  the whole song is like
0.01%:  we're making him a
0.01%:  what he did was give me
0.01%:  we might have called
0.01%:  it's more like what's the deal
0.01%:  I'd like to see the word
0.01%:  he was never a
0.01%:  it was the wrong
0.01%:  I've said this so
0.01%:  I like it when he calls
0.01%:  how did we even start this
0.01%:  we've all agreed this isn
0.04%:  we've all agreed this isn't the
0.02%:  we've all agreed this isn't the most
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well tack
0.01%:  the world we live in makes me wish I was
0.01%:  it's still valid
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in weeks
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we'd have
0.01%:  I'm sick and
0.01%:  he said he likes gr
0.01%:  it's like a thing where I
0.01%:  it's weird that'
0.01%:  it's weird that's how
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever said that
0.01%:  while we're at it I've also got
0.01%:  we're called
0.01%:  that's kinda awesome right
0.01%:  all he did was take the
0.01%:  we made him write
0.01%:  it's a term I made
0.01%:  we're also
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week so we
0.01%:  wait that came
0.01%:  what's worse
0.01%:  it's made him win awards
0.01%:  he doesn't claim either
0.01%:  I've no idea what the world'
0.01%:  I'll have to come
0.01%:  all he did was set
0.01%:  it's so great I
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how the
0.01%:  it's more like the title was
0.01%:  wait where'd I get the last
0.01%:  it's said he wrote
0.01%:  he's got more like
0.01%:  I might have to take
0.01%:  I've added all this
0.01%:  I think he died some
0.01%:  I'm all
0.01%:  what I did here is
0.01%:  what's the most
0.01%:  it's making me dro
0.01%:  it's held
0.01%:  I'll write it
0.01%:  I think that is
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's still a
0.01%:  I wrote this song with
0.01%:  he died like last
0.01%:  that's weird I think
0.01%:  this is how it
0.01%:  this makes me weird
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how we're
0.01%:  there's a lot I've missed
0.01%:  it's now like
0.01%:  I don't like where this is all
0.01%:  this makes me sort
0.01%:  there was a slight mis
0.01%:  I've said all the wrong
0.01%:  we'll get
0.01%:  it's a class
0.01%:  that was cooked
0.01%:  it's more like a child's game than
0.01%:  I think it was made
0.01%:  it's this new
0.01%:  there's two things I
0.01%:  there's two things I'
0.02%:  there's two things I'd like to add
0.01%:  there's two things I'm
0.01%:  that's most
0.01%:  this makes a lot more
0.01%:  I made that work
0.01%:  I will never get sick
0.01%:  wait I've messed it
0.01%:  he died in the '
0.01%:  what's the world
0.01%:  it doesn't have a great
0.01%:  that's ver
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've got
0.01%:  what I think we'll do is write
0.01%:  we might want to work
0.01%:  I think what we'll
0.01%:  I think what we'll do is give
0.01%:  this is the cover
0.01%:  he's talked more
0.01%:  I might've added in some
0.01%:  it's all the world
0.01%:  I've said all these words like
0.01%:  that's the world we'd lived
0.01%:  I think that last
0.01%:  the word I wanted was 'the
0.01%:  I think his real sem
0.01%:  it's more like when I'
0.01%:  I made the last eight
0.01%:  it's weird that he's given
0.01%:  it's semi
0.01%:  it's this song I
0.01%:  it's this song I wrote called
0.01%:  what I think we'll do is serve
0.01%:  this is che
0.01%:  that's a little weird when we
0.01%:  it's an awesome
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I'm having
0.01%:  it's made him a giant
0.01%:  wait I've made this worse
0.01%:  it's hard to tell how we'
0.01%:  I'm making this list
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in eight weeks
0.01%:  it's made him win three
0.01%:  are we
0.02%:  are we still
0.01%:  are we still doing
0.01%:  I'd love to see what he
0.02%:  I'd love to see what he writes
0.01%:  I'd love to see what he'
0.01%:  I'd love to see what he'd
0.02%:  I'd love to see what he'd write
0.01%:  I think we've got it
0.01%:  there's like whole
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in some
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this is where we've got
0.01%:  this is less weird
0.01%:  this is all I've added
0.01%:  that was all me
0.01%:  I've had the title
0.01%:  I've got a little
0.01%:  that made his work less
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to give the
0.01%:  I've added this last line
0.01%:  since he's dead I
0.01%:  I drew the
0.01%:  this is all I've got down
0.01%:  this is all I've got down here
0.01%:  it's worst
0.02%:  it's worst when
0.01%:  the whole second
0.01%:  I've got no idea where his
0.01%:  what's weird is that we've all
0.01%:  it's like more
0.01%:  it's making me sal
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well stick
0.01%:  he got there
0.01%:  it doesn't make me wish
0.01%:  all it's done is made
0.01%:  all it's done is made him rich
0.01%:  all it's done is made him get
0.01%:  all he did was give three
0.01%:  we've now
0.01%:  it's the second;
0.01%:  there's a video game now with
0.01%:  it's still weird how
0.01%:  he's worked on all
0.01%:  that's a movie
0.01%:  now that I've said it's like
0.01%:  it has him
0.01%:  we can't solve this
0.01%:  he's not dead right
0.01%:  there's these
0.01%:  it's more like I made this
0.01%:  worse
0.01%:  I think he was still alive
0.01%:  I don't recall what he'
0.05%:  I don't recall what he's like
0.01%:  I hate it
0.01%:  it made him the world's oldest living 
0.01%:  it's a large
0.01%:  it never made him a
0.01%:  I think it's either
0.01%:  whose
0.01%:  he's racist
0.01%:  he's still alive and did some work with
0.02%:  he's still alive and did some work with me
0.01%:  I think it's time we called him
0.01%:  he's made them
0.01%:  it's weird that his
0.01%:  it's weird that his middle
0.01%:  it's weird that his middle name'
0.01%:  what he called it was like
0.01%:  I wrote it as
0.01%:  he died last week; I'
0.01%:  it's this song where
0.01%:  I've gone mad
0.01%:  that reads like it
0.01%:  he's alive and did
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's all
0.01%:  it makes him the sole
0.01%:  what we've
0.01%:  what we've done is
0.01%:  what we've done here is we
0.01%:  what we've done here is take
0.01%:  it's made him that over
0.01%:  I think we've hit
0.01%:  it's a card
0.02%:  it's a card game with
0.01%:  as I write this down
0.01%:  the less
0.01%:  it's how he'
0.01%:  it's how he's listed
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in last
0.07%:  that was the world we lived in last week;
0.08%:  that was the world we lived in last week; I'
0.06%:  that was the world we lived in last week!!
0.03%:  that was the world we lived in last week; I'd
0.03%:  that was the world we lived in last week; we
0.03%:  that was the world we lived in last week; we'd
0.01%:  it's me who made this
0.01%:  isn't this
0.01%:  I don't see how he did
0.01%:  it's more like what we call the
0.01%:  it's the world we live in; the
0.01%:  I still like him even
0.01%:  he made them
0.01%:  now I've said the whole
0.01%:  he did all the work and
0.01%:  I read it when
0.01%:  this all seems kinda
0.02%:  this all seems kinda weird
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's his title
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's his title now
0.01%:  I think his last
0.01%:  I've still got a while
0.01%:  all he did there was solve
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's weird how we
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is viol
0.01%:  there's like what
0.01%:  all I did was give him the title
0.01%:  what we've done here is make
0.01%:  we wrote the
0.01%:  I don't see how we live
0.01%:  he never did call
0.01%:  it's more like he did it
0.01%:  what did I
0.01%:  all I did was write those
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the world is
0.01%:  he's still alive and we got
0.01%:  what I'm seeing is
0.01%:  no I'd
0.01%:  he's more in
0.01%:  we'll give it
0.03%:  we'll give it to him either
0.01%:  that gives him a weird
0.01%:  he made little
0.01%:  we call it the latter
0.01%:  more like the god
0.01%:  that's making them
0.01%:  while it's great
0.01%:  all it did was change
0.01%:  all it did was change the world
0.01%:  all it did was change the world'
0.01%:  all it did was change the world's view
0.01%:  I like how the words
0.01%:  we've made a
0.01%:  there's a stick
0.01%:  that's a well
0.01%:  we might as well throw in
0.01%:  that's the middle
0.01%:  I think there's 
0.01%:  heres
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week I was
0.01%:  that was over
0.01%:  it's more like he did that
0.01%:  while he's not
0.01%:  all he did there was give it
0.01%:  it's killed the
0.01%:  I'd like him more
0.01%:  I think it's a little
0.02%:  I think it's a little weird
0.02%:  I think it's a little weird how
0.01%:  who's the
0.01%:  that's a good idea
0.01%:  it talks more
0.01%:  the words in the middle
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; I
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; I'
0.01%:  it's never made him this
0.01%:  this is making me sad; I've
0.01%:  all he did was write down the logic
0.01%:  I'm right now
0.01%:  we all know this is
0.01%:  wait this is wrong I've
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how it
0.02%:  it's kinda weird how it's called
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how it's called the
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well with '
0.01%:  what I'd like is more
0.01%:  what we call it
0.01%:  he's the main
0.01%:  give that
0.01%:  I had that
0.01%:  this is wrong; he
0.01%:  I think he was more a god
0.01%:  I've read this like twice and
0.01%:  it's hard to tell him
0.01%:  I've said all the words twice
0.01%:  what he's called is more
0.01%:  we've still got to
0.01%:  it's where the idea
0.01%:  I've heard he's kinda
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he talks
0.01%:  we gave him the second award
0.01%:  it was his dis
0.01%:  there's a thing called '
0.01%:  I think he'd dis
0.01%:  how did we get here so
0.01%:  it's the worst ac
0.01%:  I'd call the
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like the
0.01%:  he's dead I
0.01%:  he doesn't have credit like
0.01%:  there's this idea
0.01%:  we think that
0.01%:  I've got no idea where this last
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that's the
0.01%:  that middle
0.01%:  it makes him what'
0.01%:  that's a dick move
0.01%:  this is a direct
0.01%:  this doesn't seem weird
0.01%:  it's weird that I've made
0.01%:  it's more like he's the middle aged
0.01%:  he died last week and it
0.01%:  each time
0.01%:  this last line might
0.01%:  it's the same sem
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I got
0.01%:  these words don
0.07%:  these words don't make
0.01%:  all I did was search
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this was
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well take
0.02%:  while we're at it might as well take down
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's some
0.01%:  that's a real thing!!
0.01%:  it's kinda his middle
0.01%:  I think we've missed the last
0.01%:  that's still weird when
0.01%:  that seems like it was
0.01%:  what it's done is give him two
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is sc
0.01%:  he'd never made
0.01%:  their name'
0.01%:  there he is
0.01%:  what it did was make the
0.01%:  I did this thing
0.01%:  he was more like a mid
0.01%:  wait he's still alive I'
0.01%:  this might work as
0.01%:  all he ever did was make
0.01%:  it's hard to make his
0.01%:  works
0.01%:  it's not his sem
0.01%:  it's also the world
0.12%:  it's also the world we live
0.01%:  it's also the world'
0.01%:  it's also the world we'
0.01%:  it's more that he gave it
0.01%:  the 
0.01%:  what I'd like to do here is give
0.01%:  it's more like he gets the
0.01%:  it's more like he was in
0.01%:  it's more like he's 
0.01%:  he got the nick
0.01%:  this is the worst nick
0.01%:  it's what I was
0.02%:  it's what I was doing
0.01%:  it's what I was doing while
0.01%:  it's some math
0.01%:  I'll go ahead and write
0.01%:  this is all a dream
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was solved
0.01%:  that's a met
0.01%:  it's more like c
0.01%:  I like this new world we've made a
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last time
0.01%:  it doesn't matter who'
0.01%:  it's never made it
0.01%:  we have this weird
0.01%:  it's weird how he gets
0.02%:  it's weird how he gets called
0.01%:  there was this kid named
0.01%:  while we're at it we'd
0.01%:  this is the wrong time
0.01%:  I can't give him the
0.01%:  this new world we'
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we call
0.01%:  that's like a thing
0.01%:  that's a lie; his work
0.01%:  now that we've said it we might as well re
0.01%:  he's awesome either
0.01%:  I've made him into this
0.01%:  wait where's this
0.04%:  wait where's this coming
0.01%:  it's like the god
0.01%:  it means he
0.01%:  it means he's like
0.01%:  I lied; he's not
0.01%:  that's some weird shit
0.01%:  it's also worth
0.01%:  it's made him a legit
0.01%:  it's more like he's less
0.01%:  it's making him a dad
0.01%:  right now he's a
0.01%:  it's more the whole
0.01%:  the last eight
0.07%:  the last eight words
0.02%:  the last eight lines were
0.05%:  the last eight lines were added
0.01%:  the last eight lines were made
0.01%:  this means we're all dead
0.01%:  I gave that
0.01%:  he never asked this
0.01%:  it gets worse with
0.02%:  it gets worse with each
0.01%:  we've all agreed that it's kind
0.01%:  I read the title
0.01%:  that's all I've got; we
0.01%:  I think we'll wait
0.01%:  we all agree that the
0.01%:  it's more like co
0.01%:  wait it's like the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's this
0.01%:  which one'
0.01%:  I think it's more a case
0.01%:  all I've said here
0.01%:  now that we've all
0.05%:  now that we've all agreed
0.02%:  now that we've all agreed this
0.01%:  that's the single weird
0.01%:  this is kinda the
0.01%:  we've all done
0.01%:  he's still alive and we wrote
0.01%:  it made him the sole
0.01%:  let's go ahead
0.01%:  that's more like how I
0.01%:  it's like the whole world'
0.01%:  where did this go
0.01%:  that was the word
0.01%:  wait there's still like
0.01%:  the whole song'
0.01%:  this seems to have killed
0.01%:  I'd like to hear it
0.01%:  he died a week
0.01%:  it's more like he's an old
0.01%:  I have no idea what it
0.04%:  I have no idea what it's like to write
0.04%:  I have no idea what it's like!!
0.01%:  I have no idea what it's like to get
0.01%:  he's made like
0.01%:  I messed the
0.01%:  I don't recall what his
0.05%:  I don't recall what his middle
0.01%:  while we're doing this I'd love
0.01%:  he's the world's most
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that's how we
0.01%:  this is the worst I've done all
0.15%:  this is the worst I've done all week
0.02%:  this is the worst I've done all week!!
0.01%:  I give
0.01%:  I give him
0.03%:  I give him credit
0.01%:  I'll leave it at
0.01%:  he's dead now so I'
0.01%:  he's real old
0.01%:  he's still alive and comes
0.01%:  it's made him win two
0.01%:  it's class
0.01%:  wait how does
0.01%:  we call him 'the
0.01%:  we don't call his
0.01%:  we don't call his work
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've all come
0.01%:  his name rh
0.01%:  let's avoid
0.01%:  that's a dick thing
0.01%:  we've had to
0.01%:  we've had to change
0.01%:  I read the w
0.01%:  I got the whole
0.01%:  it's nice to have
0.01%:  these are things I'
0.01%:  he doesn't get the award
0.01%:  I heard he didn
0.01%:  I think he gave it a
0.01%:  I wrote this to
0.01%:  I lied; he's called
0.01%:  it's more like what he said
0.01%:  I'd still like some cheese
0.01%:  we'll give him the same
0.01%:  we'll give him the same award
0.01%:  it's more that he is
0.01%:  let's do
0.01%:  it's with the
0.01%:  I wrote the middle
0.01%:  that's a lie; he'd
0.01%:  it's hard to make that
0.01%:  it's weird the
0.01%:  it seems he was more
0.01%:  he'll never admit
0.01%:  it's all coming
0.01%:  it's more like me
0.01%:  let's take this
0.01%:  wait I don't like this
0.01%:  wait I don't like this world
0.01%:  it's called he
0.01%:  that doesn't work with all
0.01%:  this reads like the
0.01%:  I'd like to see the words
0.01%:  seems
0.01%:  seems like he
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also add
0.01%:  it's made him the real
0.01%:  I lied; he died
0.01%:  I wish he'd worked
0.01%:  I was making all this
0.01%:  that all came
0.01%:  since it's hard
0.01%:  that's like the worst name I've made
0.01%:  it's his real middle
0.01%:  this makes me so
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we'
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've all
0.02%:  it's kinda sweet how we've all come
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we're
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've all come this
0.01%:  all he did was coin the words
0.01%:  that's kinda where I'
0.01%:  it's more light
0.01%:  he's still alive and we get
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've made
0.01%:  I gave this
0.01%:  it's more like what I'm doing with
0.01%:  we do live
0.01%:  we do live in this
0.01%:  it's more like we call
0.01%:  I think the credit
0.01%:  I'd like to award
0.01%:  I'd like to award this
0.01%:  he's worked a lot in
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like a
0.01%:  the title was added
0.01%:  it's me who's come
0.01%:  it never was
0.01%:  it seems he's more
0.01%:  I'm real glad
0.01%:  it's not like he ever
0.01%:  I wish he didn
0.01%:  this might've made it worse;
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who's sm
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he died like
0.01%:  this is the worst I've talked
0.01%:  I don't see what he's ever
0.01%:  all his work'
0.01%:  I wonder how
0.01%:  even with
0.01%:  weird
0.01%:  he has a
0.01%:  that's a weird thing to do
0.01%:  it's more like I've made that
0.01%:  there's still like a decade'
0.01%:  that's the world I'd like to live in;
0.01%:  that was like the second
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this gets
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in a week ago!!
0.01%:  I needed
0.01%:  he might've asked
0.01%:  he won his
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this whole
0.01%:  what it did was give a
0.01%:  all he did was write the most
0.01%:  this new world'
0.01%:  it's the worst thing I've said all week;
0.01%:  we're still taking
0.01%:  is it
0.01%:  with these
0.01%:  I've no idea how the rest
0.01%:  what he made
0.01%:  that's me who said
0.01%:  I've no idea who he is!!
0.01%:  I think it was his dad
0.01%:  I've no idea what this is
0.01%:  I think it'd have
0.01%:  I've done this whole
0.01%:  this got weird when I was
0.01%:  he's given credit with
0.01%:  he'd never liked
0.01%:  it's a child's game where
0.01%:  I did this wrong
0.01%:  this is what's making
0.01%:  the last two lines were me
0.01%:  it's made him all those
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child who was
0.01%:  I've said this twice now so
0.01%: ; he's more
0.01%: ; he's more like
0.01%:  I did that with
0.01%:  it has given me
0.01%:  we don't care who
0.04%:  we don't care who likes
0.01%:  we're living with
0.01%:  we're living with the
0.01%:  she was
0.01%:  I'd like the world we
0.05%:  I'd like the world we lived
0.01%:  wait now
0.01%:  I'm wrong this is the
0.01%:  his real title
0.01%:  I think it's weird we
0.01%:  all he did is write
0.01%:  I'd like to get him
0.01%:  he's all the
0.01%:  all he did is write down some
0.01%:  it's weird that we know
0.01%:  let's go home
0.01%:  I never said he was the
0.01%:  he's making a
0.01%:  I like it with cheese and
0.01%:  it'll make him one
0.01%:  that's like where
0.01%:  this solved
0.01%:  that's closer
0.01%:  he's dead; this
0.01%:  the math is kinda
0.01%:  it's more like he added to
0.01%:  it's kinda old
0.01%:  I make him
0.01%:  I don't see how this will ever lead
0.01%:  he's the single
0.01%:  I was making these words
0.01%:  it's more me who's the
0.01%:  it makes him a doctor
0.01%:  he doesn't seem to have said
0.01%:  there's like a little
0.01%:  I'm doing all
0.01%:  I'm doing all this
0.01%:  I'm doing all the work
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd love it
0.01%:  it's still the case
0.01%:  what it's made him is a world
0.01%:  this gives me more
0.01%:  it's more like he lives with
0.01%:  I know he's called the
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in weeks
0.01%:  I'm an
0.01%:  those last three
0.01%:  it gave him like
0.01%:  the word is the
0.01%:  I'm the second
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he gets called a
0.01%:  I'd still give the
0.02%:  I'd still give the award
0.01%:  it's making me star
0.01%:  I think the title'
0.01%:  it made the
0.01%:  I have no idea how we'll
0.01%:  I have no idea how we'll get
0.01%:  it's more a list
0.01%:  that's like twelve
0.02%:  that's like twelve words
0.01%:  we'll give him the award in 
0.01%:  looks
0.01%:  the thing I
0.01%:  the thing I'
0.01%:  I kinda wish we were still the
0.01%:  what I've said here is mis
0.01%:  it's more like what he did is
0.01%:  we've got the whole
0.01%:  I might have like made
0.01%:  it's a clever met
0.01%:  we're all doing that
0.01%:  we'd like to hear
0.01%:  he was here
0.01%:  wait this is the wrong
0.01%:  he also did work with
0.01%:  I might have to write a
0.01%:  we still have more
0.01%:  what I'd like more
0.01%:  what I'd like more is
0.01%:  there's a new kid
0.01%:  all I've done is make this
0.01%:  all I've done is make the
0.01%:  I'd like to close
0.04%:  I'd like to close with
0.01%:  I'd like to close with the
0.01%:  what it did is make him get
0.01%:  I think he's said to
0.01%:  it's worth seeing
0.01%:  what's weird is that I've got
0.01%:  that last line makes it
0.01%:  where'd I get that second
0.01%:  I have like two
0.01%:  what it did was get him killed
0.01%:  it's legit
0.01%:  I'd call that more
0.01%:  he had it
0.01%:  I don't work with him
0.01%:  that seems weird now that I'm
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in ages
0.01%:  wait he never said
0.01%:  isn't it
0.01%:  isn't it called
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I've come
0.01%:  that's like the worst line I've made
0.01%:  I don't get how we're still alive!!
0.01%:  it's more like he gave me this
0.01%:  I might've added that in
0.01%:  it's longer
0.01%:  it's now the world we've all
0.01%:  I've worked it
0.01%:  I'd like to see the movie where
0.01%:  what I've done here is m
0.01%:  it's like the math
0.01%:  there's like so
0.01%:  all I've said there
0.01%:  we've named him
0.01%:  this seems like it'll
0.01%:  I think that's gross
0.01%:  he'll take
0.01%:  I'd give him the title
0.01%:  I'm glad we didn
0.01%:  all I've done is take the
0.02%:  all I've done is take the words
0.01%:  we've all sort
0.01%:  it's the third one
0.01%:  we might want to re
0.01%:  wait I think we've missed
0.01%:  it's a solid
0.01%:  there's no thesis
0.01%:  it's more like his child
0.01%:  I'd like to see him answer
0.01%:  I'd like to see him answer this
0.01%:  I'm kinda mad
0.01%:  I have to go write this
0.01%:  it's still a good read even
0.01%:  this makes him even
0.01%:  it's trick
0.01%:  he's given the credit
0.01%:  what he did was like solve
0.01%:  we've made him a doctor
0.01%:  I don't see how he's called
0.01%:  that's like the wrong
0.01%:  all he did was give me this nick
0.01%:  it's all the second
0.01%:  he won't let me write
0.01%:  I like this tim
0.01%:  it was me who named it
0.01%:  wow that's kinda weird
0.01%:  I have no idea how it
0.01%:  all I know is that we
0.03%:  all I know is that we've
0.01%:  right now it
0.01%:  right now it's like
0.01%:  it's the whole middle
0.01%:  I've made it so
0.01%:  wait there's like a whole song
0.01%:  the second word was
0.01%:  this might've taken
0.01%:  this might've taken a weird
0.01%:  he's still alive and awesome
0.01%:  I named the
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad we
0.01%:  I think we've said all we'
0.01%:  we can't read the
0.01%:  I don't like the word '
0.01%:  that made him kind
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how he
0.01%:  that got worse
0.01%:  that isn
0.01%:  that isn't right
0.01%:  he's more like this
0.01%:  that name's weird
0.01%:  all that's real
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how all those
0.01%:  that's rad
0.01%:  it's more like with
0.01%:  it's like real
0.01%:  it's still me who's the
0.01%:  I agree with what
0.01%:  I have no idea where it
0.01%:  he's also worked in
0.01%:  it's called those
0.01%:  what he did was write code
0.01%:  let's stick with the old
0.01%:  it's the world we live in with
0.01%:  there's like twelve dead
0.01%:  there's like twelve dead white
0.01%:  that line made me sick
0.01%:  we can't make
0.01%:  he's dead; his
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to close
0.01%:  we all agree this is the
0.01%:  all I did is
0.01%:  that's a new word
0.01%:  it's kinda all
0.01%:  all the sem
0.01%:  I wish we were still doing math
0.01%:  I had this idea
0.01%:  I've no idea what he wrote
0.01%:  it's weird that he's not
0.02%:  it's weird that he's not called
0.01%:  it's weird that he's not dead
0.01%:  I think it's the world we'll
0.01%:  what it's done is give him a sweet
0.01%:  what he did was give rise
0.01%:  all he did was give the worst
0.01%:  we still don't have a word
0.01%:  we've called him this
0.01%:  it's right at
0.01%:  I'd like to see where he
0.01%:  I'd like to see where he stands
0.01%:  it's his math
0.01%:  these aren
0.01%:  no he's more
0.02%:  no he's more like
0.01%:  we're still having that
0.01%:  we all knew that
0.01%:  I don't recall how he'
0.01%:  I don't recall how he's viewed
0.01%:  that's wrong; it's made him a
0.01%:  it's not that weird
0.01%:  all he did was write down the same
0.01%:  I think he's called '
0.01%:  what's the world like
0.01%:  it's a two
0.01%:  that gives him a weird nick
0.01%:  it's all I'm doing
0.01%:  he's worked almost
0.01%:  that's all I ever knew him
0.01%:  it's weird to call him the
0.01%:  it's those
0.01%:  it's more like he's made his own
0.01%: ; I made
0.01%:  he was alive
0.01%:  it gave him this
0.01%:  now that we've said this we
0.01%:  wait I think we've made
0.01%:  I've made the latter
0.01%:  that's how we call
0.01%:  all I'm doing is r
0.01%:  it's more like he's a legend
0.01%:  he's still alive; I'm making that
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we'd call
0.01%:  we've agreed to call this new
0.01%:  it's the reason we call
0.01%:  he's still alive so it'd
0.01%:  it's some weird math
0.01%:  it was the '
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've made him
0.01%:  it's what we call it when we get
0.01%:  there's a whole c
0.01%:  he's cooler
0.01%:  that was like the most
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd solved it
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dad I
0.01%:  I've made him that in like
0.01%:  he did get the
0.01%:  he likes it when I add
0.01%:  it made him sort
0.01%:  it's more like a light
0.01%:  I think he got called
0.01%:  it's when he was 
0.01%:  he's even older
0.01%:  I wish he'd made it
0.01%:  his work is a little
0.01%:  I think that's a real
0.01%:  wait there's too
0.01%:  it's all these things
0.01%:  now I've said it it
0.01%:  now I've said it it seems
0.01%:  we don't have rights
0.01%:  there's like eight dead
0.01%:  it's weird that we live
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what we'd
0.01%:  he writes it down
0.01%:  the word has
0.01%:  I wrote that while st
0.01%:  while we're doing math
0.01%:  I did not write this
0.01%:  I've said that like twice
0.01%:  I'm told he
0.01%:  that's his real title
0.01%:  I think he's agreed
0.01%:  I'd watch the
0.01%:  I'd love to see his sem
0.01%:  wow I'
0.01%:  let's all ignore
0.01%:  there's no active
0.01%:  it does make me sad
0.01%:  he's doing work
0.01%:  this is what's wrong
0.01%:  while I was making
0.01%:  think
0.01%:  the word in the middle was
0.01%:  it's more that he'd like
0.01%:  I don't have the skill
0.01%:  I think it's great how we
0.01%:  I think it's great how we've made
0.01%:  I'm on
0.01%:  I think it's the same word
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is a little
0.01%:  I've said all the words in
0.01%:  it's the second time he's ever
0.01%:  we have to go
0.01%:  we've all agreed to switch to the
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to get this
0.01%:  he gets more
0.01%:  I like it when he gets
0.01%:  it was hard to come
0.01%:  this is a little weird
0.01%:  he's made his
0.01%:  what I've got
0.01%:  what I've got here is a list
0.01%:  I think it was his degree
0.01%:  his work isn't all
0.01%:  I wrote it all
0.01%:  this whole idea comes
0.01%:  in his case
0.01%:  that's the nick
0.01%:  we're making these
0.01%:  this made me wonder what
0.01%:  no it's like the worst
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in; the
0.01%:  it's what got him killed
0.01%:  I'm tired and
0.01%:  he's doing some
0.01%:  that credit
0.01%:  he gave me
0.01%:  he gave me that nick
0.01%:  he gave me this
0.01%:  I might have read it
0.01%:  I'm in the
0.06%:  I'm in the middle
0.01%:  it's that thing
0.01%:  let me take
0.01%:  it's making him the world's least
0.01%:  what it's done is wreck
0.01%:  all I did was screw
0.01%:  let's go with the sem
0.01%:  the things
0.01%:  it's weird that he's got
0.01%:  we don't give credit
0.01%:  he's died like three times since
0.01%:  while we're at it does
0.01%:  we all agree it was
0.01%:  what's he
0.02%:  what's he called
0.02%:  what's he doing
0.01%:  we all know he's more
0.01%:  that's all I've got with me!!
0.01%:  it was there
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved it this
0.01%:  while we're at it let's admit
0.01%:  I don't see what we
0.03%:  I don't see what we've
0.02%:  I don't see what we're still
0.01%:  it's the least well
0.01%:  I might've added this
0.01%:  that's all he ever did!!
0.01%:  we're doing well with
0.01%:  it's not clear who his
0.01%:  I'd never make
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well add some
0.01%:  it led
0.01%:  he's still alive and here
0.01%:  he never said '
0.01%:  this is all I've had
0.01%:  this is all I've had time
0.01%:  I think we've made this more
0.01%:  it's called the weight
0.01%:  it's where I
0.01%:  this seems more
0.01%:  this was all wrong
0.01%:  hell
0.01%:  the degree
0.01%:  while I'm asking
0.01%:  that's where I've gotten
0.01%:  I did have
0.01%:  the whole time I was rec
0.01%:  that made his work even
0.01%:  he's still alive and there's some
0.01%:  I'm making this whole deal
0.01%:  I've said all these words in
0.01%:  it's more like he's a co
0.01%:  I've had this little
0.01%:  I'll give him a
0.01%:  I made the whole god
0.01%:  it's not clear we'll
0.01%:  now that I've said it he
0.02%:  now that I've said it he's like
0.01%:  now that I've said it he's more
0.01%:  now that I've said it he'll
0.01%:  it's not clear what his
0.02%:  it's not clear what his middle
0.01%:  I've got no idea what we
0.01%:  I've got no idea what we'll
0.01%:  I think it's a lie
0.01%:  we made that last
0.01%:  what I mean is he
0.01%:  it's weird how that's a
0.01%:  it's more like he's a son
0.01%: ; it's more
0.01%:  this gives me some ideas!!
0.01%:  he was too
0.01%:  I dreamt this whole
0.01%:  I might've read this in
0.01%:  there's some claims
0.01%:  I have no rec
0.01%:  that goes
0.01%:  it's like the worst game show
0.01%:  hard
0.01%:  that gives me the idea
0.01%:  he's still alive; his
0.01%:  he's still alive; his work
0.01%:  I've thrown
0.01%:  this one's called
0.01%:  can I get
0.01%:  it's a thing he came
0.01%:  now that I've made this
0.01%:  it's so great I'
0.01%:  his name's the
0.01%:  that's how it works in
0.01%:  I can't write this well
0.01%:  his work is in the
0.01%:  it still seems
0.01%:  I might've made a little
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we've all
0.01%:  it does make me wish
0.01%:  he's still alive; he goes
0.01%:  I've made him this second
0.01%:  he still gets mad when I write
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in weeks
0.01%:  this gave me the worst
0.01%:  I've read most
0.01%:  I think we've made this all
0.01%:  it isn't clear
0.01%:  I've gotta write
0.01%:  there's this movie called '
0.01%:  it's the world we live in I was
0.01%:  we live in this
0.01%:  I think it's come
0.01%:  I'll never make
0.01%:  this is all word
0.01%:  wait that's wrong I've made
0.01%:  wait that's wrong I've made him
0.01%:  we're good with the
0.01%:  I'd like him to have
0.01%:  this is all I'm making
0.01%:  it's all made him do is give
0.01%:  the latter's his middle
0.01%:  I'm wrong; it was
0.01%:  we lost him
0.01%:  I am making all
0.01%:  I kinda love this world we
0.01%:  that's all he did!!
0.01%:  it doesn't have a direct
0.01%:  it's not clear who is
0.01%:  this is now the world we've made
0.01%:  I know there
0.02%:  I know there's a
0.01%:  here's what we
0.01%:  it's more like he's dead and we
0.01%:  his work goes well
0.01%:  all I did was change the word 'time
0.01%:  it's made him that even
0.01%:  this is the world we came
0.01%:  it's him on
0.01%:  it made him get the
0.01%:  he's made more
0.01%:  all I've got here is some
0.01%:  that's so weird I'
0.01%:  it's me who did
0.01%:  it's me who did the
0.01%:  I wrote that while asking
0.01%:  it's called sem
0.01%:  I'm in charge
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dog
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad there
0.01%:  we know the
0.01%:  all I've got are these
0.01%:  this was a real
0.01%:  I'd think
0.01%:  his work made him a legend
0.01%:  I've made him so
0.01%:  he's real good with
0.01%:  since he's still alive we
0.01%:  his work led him
0.01%:  he wrote it as
0.01%:  I've had it
0.01%:  I'm ash
0.01%:  where is he
0.01%:  it's weird how close the
0.01%:  it's weird that I'm still
0.01%:  I made these last
0.01%:  we all know his middle
0.01%:  it's weird that we call these
0.01%:  wait it's hard
0.01%:  that's like the world we'
0.01%:  I might've lost
0.01%:  I might've lost track
0.01%:  I might've read it
0.01%:  this whole time was
0.01%:  I'll give him the credit and
0.01%:  his kids are called that
0.01%:  that third line'
0.01%:  I'll give it
0.01%:  I can't see where
0.01%:  let's give the
0.01%:  let's give the credit
0.01%:  let's give the award
0.01%:  let's give the award to him
0.01%:  it was me who co
0.01%:  I think we gave the
0.01%:  we've called him that so
0.01%:  I'd like to write a song
0.01%:  their whole
0.01%:  it did make him the second
0.01%:  I've made him either
0.01%:  let's call him the
0.01%:  I said he
0.01%:  the more I talk
0.01%:  that's kinda hard
0.01%:  it's he who made
0.01%:  while we're at it can we give the
0.01%:  that's it'
0.01%:  that makes me wish we'
0.02%:  that makes me wish we'd never
0.01%:  shit
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this is all
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that's over with;
0.01%:  I've got his name
0.01%:  it's made him the world's least
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work well with sc
0.01%:  either will
0.01%:  he seems kinda
0.02%:  he seems kinda racist
0.01%:  there's a whole line
0.01%:  let's not give him that
0.01%:  he never did talk
0.01%:  now I've made him that
0.01%:  all I did was mess with the w
0.01%:  I lied; it's more
0.01%:  don't tell him that
0.01%:  he moved
0.01%:  what I'm doing here makes
0.01%:  that's not his
0.02%:  that's not his middle
0.01%:  it's me who writes these
0.01%:  I think it gave him some
0.01%:  it's making me hate
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was sem
0.01%:  he died last week and we've
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we've tried
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's come
0.01%:  wow that might
0.01%:  it's where that
0.01%:  he'd have to like
0.01%:  it made him give
0.01%:  this last line makes
0.01%:  while we're still on
0.01%:  it's more me who likes
0.01%:  it's more like he's made that
0.01%:  it's like words
0.01%:  it makes the world
0.01%:  he's still alive and he asked
0.02%:  he's still alive and he asked me to write
0.01%:  that's hell
0.01%:  I know it's more
0.01%:  this all seems weird
0.01%:  I've no idea who these
0.01%:  what I'd like to see is some
0.01%:  his work is well
0.01%:  it's his work that gave
0.01%:  I wrote that as
0.01%:  that's all we're doing this week;
0.01%:  what I've said here is still
0.01%:  all I know is that there
0.01%:  all I know is that there's some
0.01%:  we've all said this
0.01%:  it's when he talked
0.01%:  it's a tree
0.01%:  wait where did the second
0.01%:  no idea what the
0.01%:  I've got that whole
0.01%:  I think he's a legit
0.01%:  it's where the idea comes
0.01%:  wait there's a whole song
0.01%:  I wonder what the
0.01%:  this is what comes
0.01%:  it's more like g
0.01%:  he talked more
0.01%:  that's all the time we'
0.01%:  his work's called the
0.01%:  it's a re
0.01%:  it's a name
0.01%:  when I read this it
0.01%:  it was the worst
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; come
0.01%:  I'd like to see where the
0.01%:  while we're at it I've made this
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's alive
0.01%:  what I've done here is made it
0.01%:  he'd never like
0.01%:  wait I wrote this
0.01%:  the second is a lie
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well while
0.01%:  wait that's weird I'
0.01%:  I kinda wish it were called
0.01%:  there was like a whole
0.01%:  I wrote it like
0.01%:  he's into
0.01%:  we've made him this
0.01%:  I like it when he gives
0.01%:  I've added all these
0.01%:  it's a crime how
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dad;
0.01%:  sir I'
0.01%:  it's the worst name
0.01%:  now that I've said the word like
0.01%: ; it's called the
0.01%:  it was the third
0.01%:  it's the reason I
0.01%:  it's the reason I'
0.01%:  how did this even get
0.01%:  I still don't like it
0.01%:  I'll give him more
0.01%:  it's his work on what we
0.01%:  that makes him god
0.01%:  he claims to
0.01%:  it's like a cross
0.01%:  we might as well have
0.01%:  it's a video game he'
0.01%:  that's his middle name; it
0.01%:  that is where I
0.01%:  I'd call him one
0.01%:  I don't see how he likes
0.01%:  it's what he came
0.01%:  this makes me wish I never
0.01%:  it's a little weird the
0.01%:  there's video games that
0.01%:  it's like he's the god
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever get him
0.01%:  I was taking
0.01%:  it's more like he's given this
0.01%:  I think that's less weird
0.01%:  it makes sense
0.01%:  I don't get it either!!
0.01%:  it's the semi
0.01%: ; that
0.01%:  that's the wrong idea
0.01%:  I wrote those last
0.01%:  I might have looked
0.01%:  he's more alive
0.01%:  that's more like a dad
0.01%:  it's like he solved
0.01%:  it's still cool
0.01%:  this time
0.01%:  that's like the worst we
0.01%:  all I did was sing the
0.01%:  it's a real thing called the
0.01%:  I've added the last three
0.01%:  I might take this
0.01%:  I wish he'd never made
0.01%:  that's how I knew
0.01%:  who's this
0.01%:  all it did was make him the world
0.01%:  it doesn't give him credit as
0.01%:  it's me who said the
0.01%:  ignore what
0.01%:  what I did there was con
0.01%:  it's made him a whole lot
0.01%:  who was the
0.01%:  this whole time I've read
0.01%:  we can solve
0.01%:  I'd like to see who
0.01%:  I have him
0.01%:  I have him listed
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd given
0.01%:  it's his more
0.01%:  we call them god
0.01%:  all it's done is give him more
0.01%:  this whole time I've called
0.01%:  he worked on a
0.01%:  we call him like that
0.01%:  I think we gave him a
0.01%:  it doesn't have made him do
0.01%:  he's still alive I think;
0.01%:  his work is named
0.01%:  wait it's the second
0.01%:  it's all I've done
0.02%:  it's all I've done with
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell what's sem
0.01%:  I never said he liked it
0.01%:  the latter is made
0.01%:  what I read
0.01%:  let's go with this
0.01%:  he talks more
0.01%:  we've all made him one
0.01%:  we made all this
0.01%:  his last name'
0.01%:  there's a video game with a
0.01%:  we've got a lot
0.01%:  it's kinda the world we'
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in the week
0.01%:  he never called his
0.01%:  this is wrong I
0.01%:  that last line gives
0.02%:  that last line gives me ch
0.01%:  that's the world I'd live
0.01%:  it's making me wish the
0.01%:  it's like the other sem
0.01%:  he never said a
0.01%:  that is what
0.01%:  it's the worst idea I've had all week;
0.01%:  wait that's wrong I'm like
0.01%:  it's the whole time
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad he'
0.01%:  he's like the second most
0.01%:  it's nice how
0.01%:  he's not that great
0.01%:  that's less like
0.01%:  I think we got him
0.01%:  I've no idea who his kids
0.01%:  that's their nick
0.01%:  that's his dad
0.01%:  I might still take
0.01%:  what I've said is wrong;
0.01%:  he's still alive so he wrote
0.01%:  I don't see where the
0.01%:  his name comes
0.01%:  this is where it ends
0.01%:  it was his dad who came
0.01%:  I'll give the
0.02%:  I'll give the award
0.01%:  I'll give the credit
0.01%:  I'll give the award to the
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how that got
0.01%:  it's more like we call him the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we still have some
0.01%:  I wrote this all while
0.01%:  it was god
0.01%:  it's said that he'
0.01%:  that got weird when I was
0.01%:  that makes him a weird
0.01%:  what I said here
0.01%:  what's weird is that we don
0.01%:  it's even worse with
0.01%:  it's making me wish I still
0.01%:  this whole idea is kind
0.01%:  while we're at it I think we'll give
0.01%:  it makes him the doctor
0.01%:  I think we've made him a little
0.01%:  all I've done with this
0.01%:  all I've done with this is make
0.01%:  we'll change it
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how we've all
0.01%:  what I said was the
0.01%:  it's a legal
0.01%:  all it did was give him ten
0.01%:  I've made him into the
0.01%:  he's got like the
0.01%:  I don't give
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well coin
0.01%:  it did have
0.01%:  I gave him this
0.02%:  I gave him this nick
0.01%:  it's weird how when
0.01%:  it's more like he's the 
0.01%:  let's all work
0.01%:  the second time
0.01%:  we make
0.01%:  I'm not well
0.02%:  I'm not well vers
0.01%:  he was more like its
0.01%:  this is where I'm lost
0.01%:  since it was
0.01%:  the world we live in is how
0.01%:  he gets a little weird
0.02%:  he gets a little weird when
0.01%:  had
0.01%:  his work got
0.01%:  what I've said here so
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with a sem
0.01%:  he's dead so I think
0.01%:  this doesn't come
0.01%:  I've said all these things twice
0.01%:  I wish he'd solved
0.01%:  he liked the idea
0.01%:  I made those last two things
0.01%:  it's worst when he
0.01%:  all he did was give his
0.01%:  that's kinda the world
0.63%:  that's kinda the world we lived
0.01%:  that's kinda the world we'
0.01%:  this is making me decide
0.01%:  we don't have sem
0.01%:  we don't have him
0.01%:  we don't have him listed
0.01%:  this is where I've made
0.01%:  I threw all
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he's made
0.01%:  it's a time
0.01%:  it still has
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's making me
0.01%:  I'd like to see the answer
0.01%:  it's come down
0.01%:  I was making those words
0.01%:  that was more me
0.01%:  that's a sweet
0.01%:  that'll work
0.01%:  it's more that he's kinda
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's gone
0.01%:  there I was
0.01%:  it has made him two
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong this is the
0.01%:  I swear to
0.01%:  I work
0.01%:  it's almost like he's the
0.01%:  it's great when
0.01%:  that's all I've got; this is like
0.01%:  his title'
0.01%:  the world we live in gets
0.01%:  while doing
0.01%:  it's weird he's still
0.01%:  that kinda rh
0.01%:  it's a little weird he's got
0.01%:  it's what the kids
0.01%:  it's what the kids are
0.01%:  that's more him
0.01%:  that's weird; I didn
0.01%:  that's like the l
0.01%:  he's alive and well!!
0.01%:  that's like the last
0.01%:  what I'm doing is rem
0.01%:  it's the world we now
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree his sem
0.01%:  that's all we ever
0.01%:  the answer is '
0.01%:  all it did was change the word
0.01%:  I was mess
0.01%:  he seems to have died
0.01%:  it's like the world's math
0.01%:  I'd still like to see which
0.01%:  it's making him the dad
0.01%:  when I heard it
0.01%:  these were all made
0.01%:  I think we're all set
0.01%:  there's two d
0.01%:  it doesn't read well with
0.01%:  we have a whole
0.01%:  he's weird
0.01%:  his work led to a
0.01%:  this makes me wish we still
0.01%:  this makes me wish we still lived
0.01%:  it's called the god
0.01%:  it's more like less
0.01%:  while we're at it he's called
0.01%:  what it did was make him give
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like a great idea
0.01%:  this isn't what I'd
0.01%:  we all agree that's his
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this little
0.01%:  he's dead and we
0.01%:  it's given him like three
0.01%:  we don't give him a
0.01%:  the world we live in is most
0.01%:  it's more like the dad who gives
0.01%:  I'd still give the award to him
0.01%:  it's given him this award
0.01%:  that's not where it
0.03%:  that's not where it came
0.01%:  where did I come
0.01%:  all he did was give me some
0.01%:  it's weird that these
0.01%:  he's died twice and
0.01%:  it'd make me
0.01%:  it's weird how I'
0.01%:  it's weird how I've
0.01%:  he's alive and we
0.01%:  this whole time I meant
0.01%:  there's this idea called
0.01%:  this is what we've all
0.01%:  his name's more
0.01%:  I'd read his thesis
0.01%:  this whole idea is making
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd called
0.01%:  we're still making this
0.01%:  it's more that he did a
0.01%:  he was doing this
0.01%:  he was making some
0.01%:  I've made him the latter;
0.01%:  he was asked to write this
0.01%:  all he did was give the word
0.01%:  it's weird that we've gone
0.01%:  there's a whole song I
0.01%:  I'd give it a
0.01%:  now that I've said it like this
0.01%:  I might have to come
0.01%:  he calls it '
0.01%:  I read a
0.01%:  I wish it was the
0.01%:  it seems like we
0.02%:  it seems like we've
0.01%:  it seems like we've all
0.01%:  it's more how he'
0.01%:  all I did was move
0.01%:  that's how I met
0.01%:  she's the
0.01%:  what I've done right
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he was
0.01%:  made me
0.01%:  that gives me kind
0.01%:  all I did was mis
0.01%:  it's what led
0.02%:  it's what led him
0.01%:  it's more like the second sem
0.01%:  that is kind
0.01%:  he's scared
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem right I'll
0.01%:  it's like the real
0.01%:  he was like a
0.01%:  he did it more
0.01%:  I liked it more when it was the
0.01%:  it's less awesome
0.01%:  I like that word
0.01%:  it's made him god
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well those
0.01%:  I had to change it
0.01%:  it's more like when I was twelve
0.01%:  it gets worse when he
0.01%:  I don't like this world as
0.01%:  the thing is like
0.01%:  I said this wrong
0.01%:  what I did right
0.01%:  I like to call
0.02%:  I like to call him
0.01%:  where'd I get that last
0.01%:  the world we live is
0.01%:  the timing
0.01%:  he's still alive and got the
0.01%:  this takes
0.01%:  I kinda dig this world we'
0.01%:  this is where we all
0.01%:  we don't have a great
0.01%:  where did I get these
0.01%:  his work is on the
0.01%:  that's more like his second
0.01%:  wait which
0.01%:  that's kinda what I'
0.01%:  that's kinda what I've
0.01%:  it's worse than I'
0.01%:  that's how I read
0.01%:  it's more like a mat
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd solved that
0.01%:  I called him this week
0.01%:  we tried to give him a medal
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's viewed
0.01%:  it's what he did later
0.01%: ; this
0.01%:  it's kinda how we got
0.01%:  he drinks
0.01%:  his work isn't well
0.01%:  it's like two whole
0.01%:  while we're at it I've gotta
0.01%:  it makes him the 
0.01%:  I'd give him the second award
0.01%:  it's still worth the
0.01%:  it's me making
0.01%:  I've got it here with
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we call these
0.01%:  all it did was give the whole
0.01%:  no idea where I'
0.01%: ; it's the
0.01%:  his whole name'
0.01%:  that doesn't work well;
0.01%:  it seems like I've said
0.01%:  I'd never call him that to
0.01%:  it's all locked
0.01%:  that doesn't give
0.02%:  that doesn't give him
0.02%:  that doesn't give him credit
0.01%:  it's me who wrote all this
0.01%:  I can't work
0.01%:  it's more like he hasn
0.01%:  come think
0.01%:  it's the whole last
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little we've heard
0.01%:  do we
0.01%:  do we have
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like a
0.01%:  he's more in the middle
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome that
0.01%:  when he talks
0.01%:  he's less well
0.01%:  it's more like a well
0.01%:  I think he's called more
0.01%:  he's more like the sem
0.01%:  let's all give
0.01%:  I've made him that; it was
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've lost
0.01%:  I'm in love
0.09%:  I'm in love with him
0.03%:  I'm in love with this
0.02%:  I'm in love with the
0.02%:  I'm in love with the idea
0.01%:  I'm in love with this idea
0.01%:  I think he's still mad
0.01%:  it's made him a living
0.01%:  all I said
0.01%:  I'd like to see what the world is
0.01%:  it's clear we've gone
0.01%:  I'd like to close with this
0.01%:  this verse is making
0.01%:  he doesn't like it at
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well c
0.01%:  we like to
0.03%:  we like to call him the
0.01%:  it's so weird to
0.01%:  the world we live in is that I'm awesome
0.01%:  all he did was write down '
0.01%:  there's like loads
0.01%:  this isn't how we
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that I'd
0.01%:  that was well
0.01%:  I made him write this song
0.01%:  it's the world we'd like to live in;
0.01%:  this gives me a weird
0.01%:  that's more like two
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how it's called that
0.01%:  it's kinda where
0.01%:  what he's more like
0.01%:  it went
0.01%:  I think it's solved
0.01%:  all I've come
0.01%:  I still love
0.01%:  we don't make
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's too
0.01%:  he's still alive; he did
0.01%:  all the credit goes to the
0.01%:  I like this world we'
0.01%:  I've got no idea what the sem
0.01%:  this doesn't give him
0.01%:  it's more like the math
0.01%:  all I know is how
0.01%:  that made me kinda
0.01%:  he's still alive so we can ask
0.01%:  it's easier to solve
0.01%:  I've made that one
0.01%:  I call him that
0.01%:  I think we've got it all
0.01%:  no that's like the weird
0.01%:  he might've talked more
0.01%:  we'd all like to see
0.01%:  I don't get what he
0.03%:  I don't get what he did
0.01%:  this does make me wish I'd never
0.01%:  there's no video game with
0.01%:  this makes me sad;
0.01%:  it's more like the dad who was
0.01%:  that was like the second weird
0.01%:  it's a lie; he'
0.01%:  it was like the whole
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's the most
0.01%:  I'm wrong; this
0.01%:  I'm wrong; this is the
0.01%:  his work was named
0.01%:  the image
0.01%:  I'd heard he'd
0.01%:  right now I'm less
0.01%:  seems like he was
0.01%:  I admit this was
0.01%:  it's clever how
0.01%:  I'm not great
0.02%:  I'm not great with
0.01%:  I wrote a whole
0.01%:  wait I think we've got
0.01%:  he solved it right
0.01%:  what he did was design a clever
0.01%:  it's called an
0.01%:  ladies
0.01%:  his work was a
0.03%:  his work was a little
0.01%:  it was made him
0.01%:  I think we all agree it
0.04%:  I think we all agree it's the
0.01%:  what I've said doesn
0.01%:  what I've said doesn't make him
0.01%:  what I've said doesn't work
0.01%:  that's me who gets
0.04%:  that's me who gets credit
0.01%:  we all know who'
0.01%:  that's kinda weird so
0.01%:  I'd like the world we lived in to
0.01%:  wait this makes me sad
0.01%:  I can't write that
0.01%:  I can't see the
0.01%:  I've added this line
0.01%:  what it's done is make him dead
0.01%:  I've heard it's like
0.01%:  I wrote that while locked
0.01%:  this makes me wish we'd solved
0.01%:  I call them
0.01%:  it's his second sem
0.01%:  he's worked on it
0.01%:  it's where his
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how sem
0.01%:  there's a kind
0.01%:  I'm making these titles
0.01%:  I think he'd get credit
0.01%:  what we're doing with
0.01%:  he did it over
0.01%:  it's more like dad who
0.01%:  wh
0.01%:  what I did there was stick
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's also make
0.01%:  this made him like
0.01%:  that was like a
0.01%:  I can't make that
0.01%:  it's more like his dis
0.01%:  call
0.01%:  call me
0.01%:  it's the last thing
0.01%:  all I did was take some
0.01%:  he's more so
0.01%:  I called it
0.01%:  what's weird is how little
0.01%:  let's leave this
0.01%:  we don't call this
0.01%:  we gave it
0.01%:  it's this video
0.16%:  it's this video game where
0.13%:  it's this video game called
0.01%:  it's this video game I
0.10%:  it's this video game I made where
0.02%:  it's this video game I made called
0.01%:  it's this video game he
0.01%:  when I hear
0.01%:  he's the entire
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well dis
0.01%:  he died two weeks ago!!
0.01%:  he died this last
0.03%:  he died this last week
0.01%:  it's the second I'm
0.01%:  this is all we know
0.01%:  it's made him that like
0.01%:  this is a lie;
0.01%:  it was like his second
0.01%:  that last line gives me weird
0.01%:  that's like the words
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome!!
0.01%:  he wrote all
0.01%:  I'm making his last
0.01%:  it's other
0.01%:  all I know is he gave
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's inside
0.01%:  it's a sim
0.01%:  it's weird that we've talked
0.01%:  there's a lack
0.01%:  I think he res
0.01%:  I'm glad this worked
0.01%:  the world we live in's the
0.01%:  I will now
0.01%:  we wrote it
0.01%:  it was me who wrote these
0.01%:  I think he's still dead!!
0.01%:  wait I think we missed
0.01%:  wait that's wrong!!
0.01%:  he's real nice
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd read
0.01%:  the last line was me
0.01%:  this is all I'd ever
0.01%:  he's solved
0.01%:  I chose this
0.01%:  his work is what gave
0.01%:  I think this world
0.01%:  what I've said there does
0.01%:  wrote that
0.01%:  that's kinda how I'
0.01%:  it's me who was
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd love some
0.01%:  all it did was give his
0.01%:  it's a dog
0.01%:  where did this all
0.01%:  that's even
0.01%:  that's even more
0.01%:  that last word was
0.01%:  all I did was write down what he
0.01%:  it's more like he might'
0.01%:  I'd rate him like
0.01%:  the world's gone
0.01%:  it's like the most hard
0.01%:  I've messed the
0.01%:  I've messed the whole
0.01%:  we've still got the same world
0.01%:  the answer to
0.01%:  that makes little
0.01%:  it's weird he's not
0.01%:  it's weird he's not called
0.01%:  i made this
0.01%:  he's alive and his
0.01%:  he was over
0.01%:  the end
0.01%:  it's his math degree
0.01%:  it's like the other two
0.01%:  I think it gives
0.02%:  I think it gives him more
0.01%:  I think more
0.01%:  it's a great sem
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to close
0.01%:  wait that might
0.01%:  we all know who the real
0.01%:  wait I think we messed this
0.01%:  there's a whole god
0.01%:  what it's done is give him some sweet
0.01%:  he doesn't like it;
0.01%:  he doesn't like it; he'
0.01%:  it's more like the son
0.01%:  I have like 
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in!!
0.01%:  it's either called
0.01%:  I don't see what he's got
0.01%:  this is more like what I
0.01%:  it's kinda how we got here
0.01%:  it's weird that he's so
0.01%:  ma
0.01%:  I kinda hate him
0.01%:  I wrote this down while sick
0.01%:  all it did was get him hired
0.01%:  we'd call him a
0.01%:  his kids are still
0.01%:  it was me who asked the
0.01%:  it's like that movie
0.07%:  it's like that movie where
0.01%:  this is never
0.01%:  I'd like to see it
0.01%:  I think there's some small
0.01%:  I think he saw
0.01%:  this will make him one
0.01%:  he's dead so I think we
0.01%:  I might have more
0.01%:  what I did was make him
0.01%:  it doesn't matter who he
0.01%:  it doesn't matter who he'
0.01%:  it doesn't matter who he's called
0.01%:  I lied there is
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how some
0.01%:  he wrote it down with
0.01%:  we all know it's more
0.01%:  that's where I mess
0.01%:  the more we
0.01%:  the more we think
0.01%:  I've kinda messed it all
0.01%:  what it did was make me
0.01%:  I've made that entire
0.01%:  I killed
0.01%:  we tried to give him that
0.01%:  it's kinda great how these
0.01%:  we call that genre
0.01%:  it's weird how that ended
0.01%:  we'd love
0.01%:  we'd love to hear
0.01%:  I admit it
0.01%:  it's making the whole world seem
0.01%:  it's more like he missed
0.01%:  I'm kinda weird
0.01%:  he gave it this
0.01%:  I think he said it was more
0.01%:  we've taken
0.01%:  wait I messed this
0.01%:  I made the link
0.01%:  it has not
0.01%:  it's him who's called
0.01%: ; his
0.01%:  I'm making this weird
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work I have
0.01%:  this makes me glad I've
0.01%:  now that I write it like
0.01%:  I'd read his sem
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in a week ago!!
0.01%:  all that's making
0.01%:  it's a little weird he gave
0.01%:  we'll give him the doctor title
0.01%:  I still like that
0.01%:  all I've got there is a
0.01%:  this is the world we live in; we
0.01%:  it's this song that'
0.01%:  it doesn't give him that
0.01%:  the name's weird
0.01%:  I wish we were still asking

0.01%:  I missed a
0.01%:  it's little
0.01%:  I'd still like to see what he'
0.01%:  the last line might'
0.01%:  the last line might've made
0.01%:  we have it wrong
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in cos
0.01%:  he's dead so it's more like he was
0.01%:  we've said that
0.01%:  that's all I know!!

0.01%:  I'd like to see how this all
0.01%:  wait what is
0.02%:  wait what is wrong
0.02%:  wait what is wrong with me I
0.03%:  wait what is wrong with me I'

0.01%:  what I said there was like 
0.01%:  I like it more
0.01%:  what he's more well
0.01%:  real
0.01%:  this is how we got
0.01%:  this was the origin
0.01%:  I think he's smart
0.01%:  all he did was coin the word '
0.01%:  don't tell him I wrote
0.01%:  it seems like he called
0.01%:  we've had this since like
0.01%:  it's a weird sem
0.01%:  I went over
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is t
0.01%:  the world we live in makes the
0.01%:  it's what it's called here
0.01%:  we've had the wrong
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it makes
0.01%:  there's some things I'd like to add
0.01%:  that makes him weird
0.01%:  what I did there was c
0.01%:  what I did was read
0.01%:  that was the second
0.01%:  he's had a
0.01%:  that third line makes me
0.01%:  we've kinda lost
0.01%:  I'd like to have heard
0.01%:  wait I don't have the
0.01%:  the whole song's like
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as it did
0.01%:  that work is called
0.01%:  he makes it
0.01%:  that's weird that we
0.01%:  it's more like how when
0.01%:  I write it
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who's making
0.01%:  that's where it went
0.01%:  we like to call it
0.01%:  all it's done is give me the
0.01%:  all I did was change like two
0.01%:  he doesn't wear
0.01%:  that's all made
0.01%:  I'm kinda screw
0.01%:  I lied it's the world
0.01%:  I lied it's the world we live
0.01%:  that doesn't work well with a middle
0.01%:  while we're doing the
0.01%:  I asked him to review
0.01%:  I asked him to review this
0.01%:  I'll leave this right
0.01%:  it's more like a child who'
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd given
0.01%:  it's hard to see how we'd
0.01%:  he's still alive and he got mad
0.01%:  it's more so
0.01%:  I've no idea what the rest
0.01%:  it's some weird math thing
0.01%:  that was what
0.01%:  there was a little
0.01%:  it's all the things
0.01%:  it's a crime what
0.02%:  it's a crime what I've done to his
0.01%:  it's a crime what I've done with
0.01%:  in the case
0.01%:  we made this whole
0.01%:  his thing
0.01%:  his thing was
0.01%:  it's more like he does
0.01%:  he's alive right now!!
0.01%:  it's not clear how the
0.01%:  it'd make him a
0.01%:  what I've done here is make it
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we'd
0.01%:  it was what
0.01%:  it was what he called
0.01%:  that made things worse; we
0.01%:  that made things worse; we've
0.01%:  the last words
0.01%:  wait that's like the world
0.01%:  the name's like
0.01%:  I think we gave the award
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree his most
0.01%:  his work's not
0.01%:  we had to remove the
0.01%:  all I know is that he did
0.01%:  I think it's me
0.03%:  I think it's me who's made
0.01%:  I think it's me who gets
0.02%:  I think it's me who gets credit
0.01%:  I think it's me who gets called
0.01%:  I heard he likes it
0.01%:  this is all I've made
0.01%:  he said it's the
0.01%:  I don't like this world;
0.01%:  he's still alive; I don't get
0.01%:  I still don't get where
0.01%:  what I'm doing over
0.01%:  that's wrong; the sem
0.01%:  I think we're lost
0.01%:  wait I think there's a com
0.01%:  I'd love to meet
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is ad
0.01%:  we can all agree
0.01%:  here's a hint
0.01%:  wait that's all
0.01%:  that made me sick when I read
0.01%:  that was a little
0.02%:  that was a little weird
0.01%:  that's like when
0.01%:  wait I'm making these
0.01%:  it's also given
0.01%:  it's also given him the
0.01%:  I wrote this while in
0.01%:  the second verse is made
0.01%:  let's ignore this
0.01%:  all I've done is switch words
0.01%:  I wrote this the
0.01%:  that was like the world's most
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well as I'm
0.01%:  his work has since
0.01%:  I'd like to change the world we
0.01%:  where did I even get the
0.01%:  it's hard to see what
0.01%:  his answer
0.01%:  all I did was write the second
0.01%:  that's a lie; it's called
0.01%:  I've got a whole series
0.01%:  he died last week so it
0.01%:  he died last week so it's weird
0.01%:  he died last week so it's all
0.01%:  he died in like
0.01%:  I lied it's all
0.01%:  I'll give the award to him
0.01%:  it's this video game he worked
0.01%:  it's weird that we've got
0.01%:  I've made it this
0.01%:  I've read like one
0.01%:  his idea
0.01%:  it's a whole genre
0.01%:  we can't get
0.01%:  we can't talk right
0.01%:  all credit goes to his
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work I've made
0.01%:  wait where did I get the second
0.01%:  I still like the idea
0.01%:  I think he did most
0.01%:  we'll give him that second title
0.01%:  this song is more
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it was
0.01%:  I've got no idea what we're still
0.01%:  it's a work
0.01%:  I think it's a girl
0.01%:  it's weird that we'd
0.01%:  all I did was like
0.01%:  what it's done is get him made
0.01%:  let's give credit
0.01%:  I think it's called more
0.01%:  we came
0.01%:  it's his grand
0.01%:  it's all I'm ever
0.01%:  that's how I'd write it down
0.01%:  we'd all like to see him
0.01%:  he's won
0.01%:  that's a gross
0.01%:  that's a gross lie
0.01%:  I lied this whole time!!
0.01%:  it's still got
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in; I
0.01%:  I'll leave right
0.01%:  this was a great
0.01%:  the world we live in makes it
0.01%:  I added that last line
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it'll go
0.01%:  he's given this
0.01%:  he's given this award
0.01%:  we'd need
0.01%:  it makes me wonder what his
0.01%:  I'm in love with him!!
0.01%:  we all think he's dead
0.01%:  we still don't have his
0.01%:  it's this weird thing called a
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what I'm less
0.01%:  I'll have to write this down
0.01%:  it's all I ever listen
0.01%:  in the real
0.01%:  the world we live in is what I'd
0.01%:  I wrote that last line
0.01%:  I wrote that last line while
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like;
0.01%:  do we even call
0.02%:  do we even call him
0.01%:  there's like a video game now
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well read
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the whole world'
0.01%:  while that's kinda
0.01%:  he gets all
0.02%:  he gets all the credit and
0.03%:  he gets all the credit and I'
0.02%:  he gets all the credit;
0.02%:  he gets all the credit; I'
0.01%:  he gets all the credit; I've
0.01%:  he gets all the credit and I've
0.01%:  he's still alive and I screw
0.01%:  he makes me
0.01%:  all these things were
0.01%:  it was called other things like
0.01%:  that was me;
0.01%:  I've got no idea what it
0.06%:  I've got no idea what it's called
0.03%:  I've got no idea what it's like with
0.03%:  I've got no idea what it's like where
0.02%:  I've got no idea what it's like!!
0.02%:  I've got no idea what it's like where we
0.01%:  I've got no idea what it's like there
0.01%:  that's wrong; he did it
0.01%:  it's like a decade
0.01%:  I might need to write
0.01%:  we don't have to write
0.01%:  that's cool
0.01%:  we're on
0.01%:  is that right
0.01%:  it's more like he's held
0.01%:  it named
0.02%:  it named him the
0.01%:  it has given him more like
0.01%:  I can't tell what's right
0.01%:  it's more like a high
0.01%:  it's the kind
0.02%:  it's the kind where
0.01%:  while we're at it let's watch
0.01%:  we had him
0.01%:  we had him write
0.01%:  he's worth
0.01%:  these are all the
0.01%:  he gives
0.01%:  it's not clear he was
0.01%:  I gave it
0.01%:  what I'd like to see solved is what'
0.01%:  he gave this talk
0.01%:  I might have added more
0.01%:  I don't get where this came
0.01%:  that makes me the
0.01%:  he said this
0.01%:  what I've got is
0.01%:  I called him the wrong
0.01%:  it's me who wrote his
0.01%:  I don't get what's hard
0.01%:  the world is kinda
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he was ever that
0.01%:  it's more like a math thing
0.01%:  I might've made that last word
0.01%:  I can't see him ever
0.01%:  I like this new world a whole
0.01%:  he and
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well dec
0.01%:  we all know that's where
0.01%:  we have to come
0.01%:  I'm making the last three
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd have
0.01%:  I wrote this down weeks
0.01%:  it seems like a
0.01%:  that's it!!
0.01%:  it's kinda great how we've all
0.01%:  I've said this like eight
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's given
0.01%:  this whole time we've talked
0.01%:  we give the credit to his
0.01%:  the other two
0.01%:  the last two lines were a
0.01%:  it's not as
0.01%:  I've called the
0.01%:  I wrote that while mess
0.01%:  I don't give a shit
0.01%:  the same thing works
0.01%:  what I'd like right now is a sweet
0.01%:  it's not his real
0.01%:  I think he died twelve
0.01%:  it's kinda gross to
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to get some
0.01%:  it's more like we'll
0.01%:  it's kinda made him the god
0.01%:  he's dead now; his
0.01%:  I worked on this
0.01%:  it's more like a sc
0.01%:  we won
0.02%:  we won't talk
0.01%:  this was the title
0.01%:  he's not god
0.01%:  I wrote this down as
0.01%:  I liked the last
0.01%:  now that I've said it we might as well do
0.01%:  I'd never met him till
0.01%:  I kinda wish the world
0.01%:  we've all heard the
0.01%:  I can't see how this is
0.01%:  can we go
0.01%:  it's his degree that
0.01%:  how did that
0.01%:  I might have lost track
0.01%:  we've all read the
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in; I made
0.01%:  I've made him this; it's called
0.01%:  I think we threw
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's a nick
0.01%:  that's like a third
0.01%:  we write
0.01%:  this is what I'd like to write
0.01%:  he's still alive and did most
0.01%:  wait it was
0.01%:  it's like his name
0.01%:  we've all made some
0.01%:  this is making me wish we'd all
0.01%:  it made him god
0.01%:  all I did was remove the sem
0.01%:  all I did was link
0.01%:  that's what I'd like to see
0.01%:  it's hard to give the
0.01%:  he might've meant
0.01%:  I think it's less well
0.01%:  the word I want
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we have
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how the
0.01%:  wait where did that second
0.01%:  it's more like he was a god
0.01%:  it's more like he hated
0.01%:  I added the last two
0.01%:  he's good with it
0.01%:  I can't get over the
0.01%:  he's still alive I'm making
0.01%:  while we're at it let's give his
0.01%:  it's like his doctor
0.01%:  I've got that all
0.01%:  it's a little weird when I'
0.01%:  there's two things we
0.01%:  there's two things we call
0.01%:  it will take
0.01%:  I think we'd all agreed that
0.01%:  she's dead
0.01%:  we think we might
0.01%:  it's given the
0.01%:  it never made it
0.01%:  what's weird is how well
0.01%:  that's kinda weird I'
0.01%:  I liked the word
0.01%:  I got all
0.01%:  I think he did come
0.01%:  we won't ever
0.01%:  it's still the case where
0.01%:  this is a whole
0.01%:  there it's called
0.01%:  this is all screw
0.01%:  what I've done is screw
0.01%:  he's still alive and did some other
0.01%:  it's like the same word twice
0.01%:  I've read this whole
0.01%:  I think his doctor
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he gave
0.01%:  it made him a whole
0.01%:  these are all things I'm
0.01%:  I wrote this like a
0.01%:  he was this
0.01%:  I'd still take the
0.01%:  this might've made it worse!!
0.01%:  he's alive and he's worked
0.01%:  while we're down
0.01%:  I don't get how we're still alive;
0.01%:  we all know how
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's so
0.01%:  all I did there was take his
0.01%:  it's what he was called
0.01%:  wait he's never
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he's got
0.01%:  wait that's weird how
0.01%:  wait that's weird how did I get
0.01%:  wait that's weird how'
0.01%:  all that's wrong;
0.01%:  I've had it wrong
0.01%:  the second term was
0.01%:  wait he's like the
0.01%:  it's still a dick
0.01%:  it's still a dick move
0.01%:  I'd like to see where that leads
0.01%:  it's the thesis
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he was all
0.01%:  it's hard to claim
0.01%:  how did I know
0.01%:  we don't call these
0.01%:  oh
0.01%:  lots
0.01%:  he's dead like
0.01%:  I wish he'd never said it
0.01%:  his kids were all
0.01%:  it's a video game called '
0.01%:  he's got like twelve other
0.01%:  it's a white
0.01%:  in this world we've all
0.01%:  over the
0.01%:  it's the world we live in that's a
0.01%:  I was wrong; the
0.01%:  we've all agreed this makes
0.01%:  we've all agreed this makes him
0.01%:  all I did was change the word 'like
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he gets all
0.01%:  we've all agreed this isn't a
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we'd like
0.01%:  I'd like him to write me
0.01%:  he was made
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well take down
0.01%:  we all think he's great
0.01%:  he's more a dad
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in; we'd
0.01%:  I never made
0.01%:  I think it's more how
0.01%:  it makes him the world's oldest living 
0.01%:  there's this song called
0.01%:  he's still alive and might'
0.01%:  there's like a ton
0.01%:  I think we're all good with
0.01%:  it'll make me
0.01%:  there was a movie
0.01%:  there's a lot we'
0.01%:  I don't get how his
0.01%:  it's this woman
0.01%:  comes down
0.01%:  it gives him credit as
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd called it that
0.01%:  what we've got
0.02%:  what we've got here is called
0.01%:  it doesn't show
0.01%:  I think we miss
0.01%:  it's his degree that's made
0.01%:  I've added in the last
0.01%:  what's even
0.01%:  he doesn't ever talk
0.01%:  I walked
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd made more
0.01%:  it's not his real middle
0.01%:  this line makes me
0.01%:  I think he also made
0.01%:  that's his title
0.01%:  we don't all
0.02%:  we don't all agree
0.02%:  we don't all agree with
0.01%:  we don't all agree with this
0.01%:  we don't all agree with the
0.01%:  it was his sister
0.02%:  it was his sister who came
0.01%:  I think we're all a
0.01%:  I lied; he's a
0.01%:  the reason he
0.03%:  the reason he's called
0.01%:  he covers
0.01%:  I think we've still got a while
0.01%:  give me a sec I'm still
0.01%:  all he did there was give some
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; this was
0.01%:  it's kinda sad he
0.01%:  I'd still like to see him give
0.01%:  it's closed
0.01%:  he's dead; I
0.01%:  ever since I said this
0.01%:  it's a little weird when we'
0.01%:  we'll have to get him
0.01%:  while I'm at it here
0.02%:  while I'm at it here's some
0.01%:  it's called a sem
0.01%:  it's made him think
0.01%:  it's me who gets to decide what's sem
0.01%:  it's like that'
0.01%:  the latter came
0.01%:  it's more like he's gained
0.01%:  we had to change it
0.01%:  that made his kids
0.01%:  it shows
0.01%:  it's making me wish that we
0.01%:  it's making me wish that we lived
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he'd get
0.01%:  he did this work on
0.01%:  all I've got is a link
0.01%:  that was the world'
0.01%:  all it did was get him his
0.01%:  this all might'
0.03%:  this all might've worked
0.01%:  that's a gross mis
0.01%:  he's still alive; he didn
0.01%:  what he did was give some lower
0.01%:  I think it's a made
0.01%:  what I've said there is almost
0.01%:  we know he'
0.01%:  it's still where
0.01%:  he's died since the
0.01%:  that's got
0.01%:  I might have named
0.01%:  I've come down
0.03%:  I've come down with the
0.02%:  I've come down with this
0.07%:  I've come down with this weird
0.01%:  I've come down with a slight
0.01%:  I've come down with a weird
0.01%:  that's made me kind
0.01%:  wait we're doing this all
0.01%:  that's the world I'm
0.01%:  he did the real
0.01%:  he takes
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in;
0.01%:  I added the last two lines there
0.01%:  all it did was get me
0.01%:  it's kinda called the
0.01%:  it's weird that we talk
0.01%:  what he did was list
0.01%:  it's this video game he made called
0.01%:  we can't tell what
0.01%:  we can't tell what he likes
0.01%:  we can't tell what he's like
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd advise
0.01%:  it's on the
0.01%:  it's on the cover
0.01%:  it's this here
0.01%:  he came to
0.01%:  there's two things I've
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I'm making these
0.01%:  there's this image
0.01%:  it's like the worst song I've made
0.01%:  it's made him three
0.01%:  isn't he like
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we still have this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we live here
0.01%:  this gave me some weird
0.01%:  all I did was make this
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd still
0.01%:  I made him write the second
0.01%:  it's a dead
0.01%:  we're named
0.01%:  wait that's the world
0.21%:  wait that's the world we live
0.01%:  wait that's the world we lived in like
0.01%:  wait that's the world we'
0.01%:  it's called the weak
0.01%:  he was like the second
0.01%:  he worked on it with
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in that
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in that'
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in that was
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child than
0.01%:  it's more like what I did with
0.01%:  I kinda still
0.01%:  now that I've said it he'll get
0.01%:  the title's more
0.01%:  I don't agree with the sem
0.01%:  this song works
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd write some
0.01%:  we have like three
0.01%:  I heard it's like
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in;
0.01%:  it was less
0.01%:  what he did was give an
0.01%:  what's weird is that we know
0.01%:  we've had this weird
0.01%:  I made the last thing
0.01%:  when it comes to his
0.01%:  it's me who's making those
0.01%:  it's the world we live in the
0.01%:  this is worse than I'
0.01%:  he's having
0.01%:  he's like a doctor
0.01%:  there's still a good
0.01%:  I think there's a semi
0.01%:  we might have some
0.01%:  I wrote that down while we talked
0.01%:  this is like the most awesome
0.01%:  I kinda got
0.01%:  wait I looked
0.01%:  there's like a movie
0.01%:  there's like a movie called
0.01%:  we've all agreed this is too
0.01%:  that's the cool
0.01%:  it's hard to talk while doing
0.01%:  wait a sec I think
0.01%:  it's what it's called;
0.01%:  that's making more
0.01%:  wow this was
0.01%:  he's listed in
0.01%:  it called him the
0.01%:  what I did there was edit
0.01%:  it was more like two
0.01%:  this has me
0.01%:  it's the second right
0.01%:  it's still a valid degree
0.01%:  a whole
0.01%:  that's the second time I've worked
0.01%:  that's a lie he did
0.01%:  that's his work in
0.01%: ; I'
0.01%:  he did solve it
0.01%:  we call them two
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is still
0.01%:  it's what it's called when we give
0.01%:  he's still in grad
0.01%:  I don't see how we live with
0.01%:  wait that's like the world we
0.03%:  wait that's like the world we lived
0.01%:  I might've made that last one
0.01%:  wait I've made him the
0.01%:  it's more like he made that
0.01%:  there's like the
0.01%:  he's still an
0.01%:  it all goes
0.01%:  I liked that rh
0.01%:  it's making him either
0.01%:  I lied he's never said
0.01%:  what I think we're all
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd solved this
0.01%:  we think it was his
0.01%:  it's more that he's liked
0.01%:  I don't see how he gets called
0.01%:  the last two were
0.01%:  it was this whole
0.01%:  this is the word
0.01%:  it's social
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's god
0.01%:  he doesn't like garlic
0.01%:  it's all I talk
0.01%:  there's a whole song like
0.01%:  in this world he
0.01%:  while we're at it we'll give
0.01%:  there's a video game I'
0.01%:  it's not clear how he'd like
0.01%:  this is what I'll write
0.01%:  what it did was give me some
0.01%:  it's making more
0.01%:  it's more like I added the
0.01%:  it's a video game he wrote
0.01%:  it's still here
0.01%:  that's making it seem worse
0.01%:  it's like that weird
0.01%:  I think we've all lost sight
0.01%:  it's me who gets to decide where
0.01%:  all it did was give a
0.01%:  it's more like his head
0.01%:  this is all lies
0.01%:  here's a good
0.01%:  wait what'
0.04%:  wait what's wrong
0.14%:  wait what's wrong with me
0.02%:  wait what's wrong with me I
0.01%:  I've said this entire
0.01%:  that's where I've got it
0.01%:  he'd like that
0.01%:  I like these
0.01%:  wait I messed it
0.01%:  it's a shame we
0.01%:  he was never that
0.01%:  all three
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he ended
0.01%:  I'm still in
0.02%:  I'm still in the middle
0.01%:  it's more like we've had
0.01%:  there's like twelve things I
0.01%:  I think we've all read this
0.01%:  it's what we call it when we give
0.01%:  I don't like this world!!
0.01%:  wait it's not
0.01%:  it's not a crime
0.01%:  I wrote this c
0.01%:  the thing I said
0.01%:  I think he's still alive; we're good
0.01%:  he still likes it when we
0.01%:  it's them
0.01%:  he'd like some
0.01%:  it's like a small
0.01%:  I still think he was more
0.01%:  I think it's time we moved
0.01%:  it's making me real th
0.01%:  it's make
0.01%:  it's make him the
0.01%:  it's kinda tragic how he died
0.01%:  that's not how it'
0.01%:  what I did there is like
0.01%:  I'm making these last words
0.01%:  we've all agreed that the second
0.01%:  it's more like he's doing the
0.01%:  it was him who co
0.01%:  we don't call him his
0.03%:  we don't call him his middle
0.01%:  it is more like
0.01%:  here's what I'd
0.02%:  here's what I'd like to do
0.02%:  here's what I'd like to see
0.01%:  it's more like he's a middle aged
0.01%:  this is the last time
0.04%:  this is the last time I'm ever doing
0.03%:  this is the last time I'll
0.02%:  this is the last time I'll ever make
0.01%:  this is the last time I ever
0.01%:  this is the last time I've
0.01%:  I've listed the
0.01%:  this is how we decide
0.01%:  I'll let him write
0.01%:  all I did was get the
0.01%:  I got it
0.01%:  it's like his third
0.01%:  that's a weird sim
0.01%:  it's weird how he doesn
0.02%:  it's weird how he doesn't get
0.03%:  it's weird how he doesn't get called
0.02%:  it's weird how he doesn't like
0.01%:  it's weird how he doesn't talk
0.01%:  I'm taking credit
0.01%:  I don't like him that
0.01%:  it's more like a middle aged
0.01%:  it's the word salad
0.01%:  I've made him this since
0.01%:  all he did was give the sem
0.01%:  there's a whole song I'
0.01%:  it's kinda short
0.01%:  there's a kid
0.01%:  what I wrote down
0.01%:  what I'm asking is where
0.01%:  the idea came to me while
0.01%:  he got the award in
0.01%:  we call this time
0.01%:  it's all we've done with
0.01%:  I'll go with the
0.01%:  I think he's cool
0.01%:  all he did was write '
0.01%:  I'm a little scared now
0.01%:  what I want
0.01%:  it's a little weird we have
0.01%:  I think we've got his
0.01%:  we like that
0.01%:  we all agree it's a
0.01%:  I might've messed that all
0.01%:  this is the second weird
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's kind
0.01%:  wait I've messed this all
0.01%:  what I've said is kind
0.01%:  we can't give him this title
0.01%:  I've no idea how it
0.01%:  in that
0.01%:  what I'm doing is mis
0.01%:  it's hard to talk when I've
0.01%:  I'm making this the
0.01%:  I'm making this the world
0.01%:  he died this week and I've
0.01%:  that doesn't read
0.05%:  that doesn't read well
0.01%:  that doesn't read like
0.01%:  there's now like eight
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've named
0.01%:  I don't see how he'd ever get
0.01%:  we'll give him that award
0.01%:  it's more like he was the second dad
0.01%:  he's still alive; it's more
0.01%:  who cares it's all
0.01%:  I think he missed some
0.01%:  either he
0.03%:  either he's dead
0.01%:  this song makes me sad
0.01%:  this seems like the world I
0.02%:  this seems like the world I live
0.02%:  this seems like the world I'd live
0.01%:  this seems like the world I've
0.01%:  I'd make
0.01%:  it's more making
0.01%:  I got his middle
0.01%:  we'd never
0.01%:  we'd never call
0.01%:  we'd never call it
0.01%:  all I did was make some
0.01%:  it's more like he's solved a
0.01%:  it's all I read
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well review
0.01%:  we all hate
0.01%:  I think he also came
0.01%:  it's more that he's well liked
0.01%:  I might have to call
0.01%:  who cares it's still
0.01%:  while I'm still here
0.01%:  I'm glad we're still in
0.01%:  it's weird he's not dead
0.01%:  it's a semi
0.01%:  I don't have the c
0.01%:  it's still like a
0.01%:  it's still like a decade
0.01%:  I think there's a class
0.01%:  he's now the
0.01%:  I've taken his
0.01%:  I have no idea how we'll decide
0.01%:  while I'm doing the
0.01%:  I kinda mis
0.01%:  it has led him
0.01%:  the same goes
0.01%:  wait this is all wrong I
0.02%:  wait this is all wrong I'
0.02%:  wait this is all wrong I've
0.01%:  I'm making the worst
0.01%:  that's all I've come here
0.01%:  it's made him a thing
0.01%:  we'd like him
0.01%:  we'd like him to solve
0.01%:  it's not like he's dead
0.01%:  I don't have a great
0.01%:  I'm still new to this whole
0.01%:  I've grown
0.01%:  I've grown to like this
0.01%:  it gave him more
0.01%:  he doesn't get his middle
0.01%:  I'm wrong that's his middle
0.01%:  we still have him
0.01%:  what I'd like to see is a world
0.01%:  he's more like his
0.01%:  he loved
0.01%:  I have that
0.01%:  we'll give him the credit and
0.01%:  I'll wait here
0.01%:  I was rec
0.01%:  that's all his
0.01%:  that's all his work
0.01%:  it's made him that since
0.01%:  all he did was list
0.01%:  all he did was list some
0.01%:  it's weird to see
0.01%:  all I've said is the
0.01%:  I've made little
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week I was
0.01%:  this is all the wrong
0.01%:  he gets called a
0.01%:  it's in a
0.01%:  we've had that since like
0.01%:  I've said all these words with
0.01%:  we all agree that's kind
0.01%:  he likes to
0.01%:  I don't agree with his claims
0.01%:  it's worth two
0.01%:  it's more like that he was
0.01%:  it's like the world's slow
0.01%:  I think the term is '
0.01%:  what it's done is make me wish I'd read
0.01%:  this dream
0.01%:  it's asking
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's kind
0.01%:  it's weird he named
0.01%:  that's the world we live in; I made
0.01%:  he was having
0.01%:  wait that's wrong the
0.01%:  it's more like semi
0.01%:  all he did is write down the
0.01%:  this makes me glad we
0.01%:  this makes me glad we're still
0.01%:  wait this is worse
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell who's a
0.01%:  I'd like to see this solved
0.01%:  it's more like he stole
0.01%:  the last line was made
0.01%:  this last line was
0.01%:  I'm in love with his
0.01%:  it's weird that we've made
0.01%:  he's also well
0.01%:  that title'
0.01%:  now that we've got this
0.01%:  I've cried
0.01%:  he's good at math
0.01%:  there I think
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's add
0.01%:  I don't see how he'd like
0.01%:  I think what we're all
0.01%:  I don't care what he likes to
0.01%:  it's kinda gross how I
0.01%:  that idea
0.01%:  this is all the worst
0.01%:  this is where I tell
0.01%:  the world we live in is awesome!!
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well end
0.01%:  he did all that
0.02%:  he did all that work
0.01%:  it's what it's called when two
0.01%:  I'ma lie
0.01%:  this leaves me with like
0.01%:  I wrote it while st
0.01%:  this all kind
0.01%:  that's a little more
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well sm
0.01%:  we don't like him that
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we
0.05%:  it doesn't seem like we've made
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like we have
0.04%:  it doesn't seem like we've had
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like we have a word
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we've heard
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we're
0.01%:  I wrote this down like
0.01%:  this is the world we live in; I made
0.01%:  what he's doing is called
0.01%:  that's this weird
0.01%:  there's still one
0.01%:  I think the world we'
0.01%:  that was me who'
0.01%:  he loves it
0.01%:  this is all kinda weird
0.01%:  that gave me like
0.01%:  he's still living; I
0.01%:  what's that word
0.01%:  it's the case
0.01%:  it's the case where
0.01%:  the second is weird
0.01%:  I wrote that while taking
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we were
0.01%:  he still works with
0.01%:  we're still asking that
0.01%:  what he did was call
0.01%:  it's hard to decide the
0.01%:  wait that's screw
0.01%:  seeing
0.01%:  seeing him
0.01%:  I think he's cried
0.01%:  while we're at it I was
0.01%:  I'd never get
0.01%:  while we're making this
0.01%:  he's more with
0.01%:  his work has done
0.01%:  that's wrong; he's still alive!!
0.01%:  this right
0.01%:  it makes him a dad
0.01%:  all I've got here is his sem
0.01%:  I think he's sort
0.01%:  it's making me wish I had read
0.01%:  I'll never admit this
0.01%:  it's the second time he's made it
0.01%:  it's hard to take
0.01%:  I can't read it
0.01%:  this is more like what I'
0.01%:  I'm in over
0.01%:  that's a review
0.01%:  what I've said there was
0.01%:  I think we're still ahead
0.01%:  he's like a dad
0.01%:  I'd like to give him his
0.01%:  this all got
0.01%:  this all got weird
0.01%:  he'd kinda
0.01%:  I think we gave him a medal
0.01%:  wait he did
0.01%:  have we
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's weird when we
0.01%:  I'll have to change
0.01%:  it's weird that he's alive
0.01%:  he's making me
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I miss
0.01%:  it's a little weird he gets
0.01%:  it's not clear we'd
0.01%:  it's all worth
0.01%:  he's more like the d
0.01%:  he's more like the dads
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well admit
0.01%:  it's him who made it
0.01%:  it's more what I
0.01%:  it's kinda where the
0.01%:  this is what I'd call
0.01%:  that's the last word
0.01%:  that needs
0.01%:  he's still living so I
0.01%:  all he did was change
0.01%:  let's go have
0.01%:  he did it like
0.01%:  there's not that
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we've had that
0.01%:  I'd like to see him give that
0.01%:  it's moved
0.01%:  it's this thing called a
0.01%:  wait it's weird
0.01%:  I've heard it's a little
0.01%:  we're not all
0.01%:  we're moving the
0.01%:  it's this song I made
0.01%:  wait a sec I'm making
0.01%:  now that I've said it's weird how
0.01%:  that's all lies
0.01%:  that's wrong; it's made him like
0.01%:  wow there
0.01%:  wow there's like
0.01%:  we don't hear
0.01%:  that was the second time
0.02%:  that was the second time I've said
0.01%:  it was like that
0.01%:  I've gotta write this
0.01%:  this isn't all
0.01%:  wow I didn
0.01%:  there's a c
0.01%:  I kinda wish we were still at
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who liked
0.01%:  that's weird since he's still
0.01%:  we've all lost track
0.01%:  that doesn't make him a god
0.01%:  he might've done it
0.01%:  this was a weird thing
0.01%:  what came
0.01%:  what I did there was awesome
0.01%:  I still like the word
0.01%:  it's close
0.01%:  I got a
0.01%:  we talk
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child!!
0.01%:  there's a lot I'd like to see
0.01%:  it's the second word I
0.01%:  it's the second word I made
0.01%:  it's the second word I'
0.01%:  I've heard it's kinda
0.01%:  I might've kinda made all
0.01%:  that's what I've said
0.01%:  it's more like a child than
0.01%:  I've come to like
0.01%:  I've come to like this
0.01%:  I think there's some valid
0.01%:  this was like the 
0.01%:  there's like a giant
0.01%:  write this
0.01%:  that's a work
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like that
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like that's where
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like that's how
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like that's his
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like that's a
0.01%:  his role
0.01%:  will
0.01%:  it's like most
0.01%:  I think this is a good
0.01%:  it's weird how he came
0.01%:  he shared
0.01%:  that's kinda racist;
0.01%:  it makes him the second dad
0.01%:  it's given him like the
0.01%:  we're still living the
0.01%:  we're still living the same
0.01%:  I added the rh
0.01%:  I'll let him decide what'
0.03%:  I'll let him decide what's more
0.01%:  it's more like what his
0.01%:  it's gone over
0.01%:  it killed
0.01%:  I'm making all that shit
0.01%:  that's wrong; this
0.01%:  that's wrong I have
0.01%:  I've made him the world
0.01%:  since he's dead it
0.03%:  since he's dead it's more
0.01%:  since he's dead it's more like the
0.01%:  since he's dead it's more like his
0.01%:  it's a t
0.01%:  he had little
0.01%:  all it did was make me
0.01%:  he was doing it with
0.01%:  I think it's still a
0.01%:  he did this in
0.01%:  it's more like he's given a whole
0.01%:  that's close
0.01%:  it's like the world's most active
0.01%:  the world's like
0.01%:  the world's like this now
0.01%:  we still don't like him
0.01%:  it's more like he's made things
0.01%:  it's called some other thing like
0.01%:  we've called them
0.01%:  he's lived longer
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd called the
0.01%:  I made that entire
0.01%:  I get it
0.01%:  while it's called
0.01%:  it's worse than we
0.01%:  that's his claim
0.01%:  with some
0.01%:  this gives me a new
0.01%:  it's more like a decade
0.01%:  this is where we all get
0.01%:  what I've said is wrong like
0.01%:  I might have said more
0.01%:  that's still kinda racist
0.01%:  I've not read this
0.01%:  as it
0.01%:  I'm glad we're still in the same
0.01%:  he gets all the credit; I was
0.01%:  while we're at it he was
0.01%:  what I said there is kind
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd read it
0.01%:  I'm kinda scared that
0.01%:  there's no middle
0.01%:  he's still alive and here'
0.01%:  the claims
0.01%:  he's still alive and it'd
0.01%:  it's a weird thing he did
0.01%:  here I'm making
0.01%:  there's also a whole
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd lived
0.01%:  that work was called
0.01%:  now that I've read that
0.01%:  it's making me wish he was
0.01%:  he died last week; the
0.01%:  he died last week; the world
0.01%:  I think this made me
0.01%:  that's weird to think
0.01%:  it makes him the worst
0.01%:  wait hold on I'
0.01%:  what I did there is a
0.01%:  all I'm asking
0.01%:  it's their names
0.01%:  it's what I call
0.01%:  he doesn't strike me as a
0.01%:  it's me who is making
0.01%:  we've all agreed to this
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is talk
0.01%:  he still doesn
0.01%:  he still doesn't have
0.01%:  he still doesn't like it
0.01%:  he still doesn't care
0.01%:  I don't like this where
0.01%:  that'd make this
0.01%:  it's this song I'
0.01%:  it's this song I've
0.01%:  he seemed
0.01%:  that'd make me the
0.01%:  this rec
0.01%:  we never called him that;
0.01%:  he gave it to
0.01%:  with me
0.01%:  I wrote this like two
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm wrong
0.01%:  I think he was less
0.01%:  it was me who did it
0.01%:  I think we're all doomed!!
0.01%:  it's still a closed
0.01%:  that word'
0.01%:  I've got this all screw
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that it
0.01%:  it's called random
0.01%:  this song's like
0.01%:  here's a thing
0.01%:  he gets mad when I call it
0.01%:  all it's done is make him rich!!
0.01%:  we still have like two
0.01%:  we've all gotten
0.01%:  we've had this entire
0.01%:  wow that was like
0.01%:  it's a real thing with
0.01%:  it's making him world
0.01%:  I've added the other
0.01%:  don't ask me where I'
0.01%:  now I've said this twice
0.01%:  it was the title
0.01%:  the world is still awesome
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well rec
0.01%:  I think these are called
0.01%:  how did we get here;
0.01%:  all he did was write down twelve
0.01%:  he might've worked at
0.01%:  it's a little gross
0.01%:  it's a little gross when
0.01%:  I've no idea how well he
0.02%:  I've no idea how well he liked
0.02%:  I've no idea how well he likes
0.01%:  I've no idea how well he did

0.01%:  it's still kinda weird how he came
0.01%:  that's still the same
0.01%:  it's here that we
0.01%:  it's more like he's a dead
0.01%:  I kinda messed the whole
0.01%:  I'm glad we're all
0.01%:  that last line screw
0.01%:  close
0.01%:  I've tried to make him
0.01%:  all that's made
0.01%:  all that's made him is old
0.01%:  all that's made him is tired
0.01%:  all that's made him is like
0.01%:  all that's made him is sick
0.01%:  I think we'd get
0.01%:  we'll give him some
0.02%:  we'll give him some credit
0.01%:  it's kinda l
0.01%:  I've called him that in
0.01%:  he was at the
0.01%:  it's all I'm doing with
0.01%:  I've since
0.01%:  I've read almost
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm adding that
0.01%:  I've no idea what he worked
0.01%:  it's the lack
0.01%:  we live in the world we did
0.01%:  we still don't give awards
0.01%:  I hate this world we
0.01%:  I did it while
0.01%:  now that I've rec
0.01%:  I don't see how this will ever get me
0.01%:  that's words
0.01%:  this was the sem
0.01%:  when I read it it'
0.01%:  that's all I've done
0.03%:  that's all I've done with
0.01%:  it gets worse when he'
0.01%:  it's more like he's lost
0.01%:  we call his kids
0.01%:  he died last week I
0.01%:  that's a little weird h
0.01%:  I might have re
0.01%:  I think it gives him a
0.01%:  we take
0.01%:  it's more like I'm adding
0.01%:  we have to make
0.01%:  we'd still like the
0.01%:  I get that
0.01%:  it's hard to see how we'd get
0.01%:  I'd still like to see where
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we missed
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we missed the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we missed that
0.01%:  I think we messed it
0.01%:  it's not that hard
0.01%:  I'd like to review the
0.01%:  I kinda miss the old world we
0.01%:  wait hang
0.01%:  little
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's good
0.01%:  it's like made
0.01%:  it's like made him the
0.01%:  the video game was called
0.01%:  wait I was making
0.01%:  I think he did all
0.01%:  we live in the world we'd
0.01%:  wait this got
0.02%:  wait this got weird
0.01%:  I'm at
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the world we
0.01%:  I'm glad we're done with all
0.03%:  I'm glad we're done with all this
0.01%:  wow this is like
0.01%:  wow this is like the worst
0.01%:  it's weird that we all
0.01%:  wait we need
0.01%:  he cried
0.01%:  it was called a
0.01%:  I'm making this rh
0.01%:  I have no idea who did
0.01%:  what he did was stick
0.01%:  the other sem
0.01%:  we call him the world
0.01%:  we call him the world's most
0.01%:  I think he'll get credit
0.01%:  it's more akin
0.01%:  this is the least weird
0.01%:  I lied and wrote
0.01%:  it's all I've read since the
0.01%:  the world we live in is that I made
0.01%:  he's like the world's second
0.01%:  that was more like eight
0.01%:  I'd like to see what'
0.01%:  I lied it's the second
0.01%:  it's kinda screw
0.01%:  I don't like this idea
0.01%:  it's the weird thing
0.01%:  all it's done is make him world
0.01%:  he and his work
0.01%:  I think that's racist
0.01%:  we call this kind
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which I've
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which I've said
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was design
0.01%:  I think it's the more
0.01%:  that's what's wrong
0.01%:  it's w
0.01%:  it's all I have
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked with me!!
0.01%:  I can see how this
0.01%:  that makes him twice as old
0.01%:  he's alive and he worked
0.01%:  all he did was the
0.01%:  his middle name is right
0.01%:  when this
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've come
0.01%:  it made him that in
0.01%:  let's do this
0.01%:  now that I've read what
0.01%:  it's what made him get
0.01%:  I've said his name right like
0.01%:  he was doing work with
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's hard
0.01%:  I'd like him to answer the
0.01%:  that's a lie; he's never liked
0.01%:  there's limits
0.01%:  there's limits to what
0.01%:  there's limits to what I'
0.01%:  all I did was read his
0.01%:  he did make this
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd called it that
0.01%:  I've no idea what his work'
0.01%:  I've no idea what his work's called
0.01%:  we live in the world the
0.01%:  he's tried to solve
0.01%:  now that we've made him
0.01%:  this tells
0.01%:  he's at home
0.01%:  I've made him like
0.01%:  all I know is he did
0.01%:  we're adding the
0.01%:  we call him more like
0.01%:  it's a girl
0.01%:  all he did was model
0.01%:  it's weird that's what
0.01%:  I lied; it's the worst
0.01%:  those sem
0.01%:  as the
0.01%:  it calls
0.01%:  those two were
0.01%:  he's made the
0.01%:  it's not all
0.01%:  we all know it's the latter
0.01%:  I might've missed the word
0.01%:  that's aw
0.01%:  we all know it's him
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how well the
0.01%:  all he'
0.02%:  all he's done is write
0.01%:  all he's done is give
0.01%:  I think the latter
0.01%:  given this
0.01%:  that's not right;
0.01%:  I'm having some weird
0.01%:  we'll give him like
0.01%:  he lives in the
0.01%:  it's like a hard
0.01%:  it's weird that I've made him
0.01%:  while we're at it I think it
0.03%:  while we're at it I think it'd
0.02%:  while we're at it I think it's called
0.01%:  it's making me sad that I
0.01%:  it's making me sad that I've
0.01%:  this will make more sense with
0.01%:  he was given the latter
0.01%:  I'd like to see who writes
0.01%:  that was hard
0.01%:  all it did was give him the term
0.01%:  let's go with the last
0.01%:  that's a weird title
0.01%:  when I saw the title
0.01%:  there's a disc
0.01%:  I made the head
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we still have time
0.01%:  we don't have a time
0.01%:  this gives me a lot
0.01%:  I think it's called god
0.01%:  I think it's more he
0.01%:  I can't do his
0.01%:  his work's in
0.01%:  I don't like how it
0.01%:  I don't like how it rh
0.01%:  what are the
0.01%:  what are the odds we
0.01%:  what are the odds we'll
0.01%:  he never said it'
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he makes
0.01%:  I don't get the rh
0.01%:  that was a little weird when
0.01%:  I think he was called '
0.01%:  I swear that
0.01%:  all he did was cover
0.01%:  all he did was cover the
0.01%:  it's more like it's the
0.01%:  what I do is write
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who'd
0.01%:  can we get this
0.01%:  it's more what he did since
0.01%:  that's the song
0.01%:  wow that's the
0.01%:  we call '
0.01%:  we call the kids
0.01%:  we call the kids who
0.01%:  that's weird; he's still
0.01%:  what I've done here is listed
0.01%:  I think its
0.01%:  we've made this whole
0.01%:  this show
0.01%:  this is a tragic
0.01%:  I've read it twice and
0.01%:  we still have to decide who'
0.01%:  where did this get
0.01%:  he's dead so we'
0.01%:  in the world
0.04%:  in the world we lived
0.01%:  it's right on
0.01%:  all I did was write the same
0.01%:  all I did was write the same thing
0.02%:  all I did was write the same thing twice
0.01%:  we've lost him
0.01%:  those were the last
0.01%:  it's weird how well that song
0.01%:  it's hard to tell whose side
0.01%:  it's more that he'll
0.01%:  it's him with
0.01%:  let's all agree it
0.02%:  let's all agree it's the
0.01%:  let's all agree it's the second
0.01%:  I think it's clear he was
0.01%:  I'm still mad
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as I wished
0.01%:  it's not clear who made
0.02%:  it's not clear who made him
0.01%:  it's weird I'm doing
0.01%:  I think that's clever
0.01%:  it's all I've said since
0.01%:  there's two things I like
0.01%:  I think he's made it so
0.01%:  it's the other like
0.01%:  it's a string
0.01%:  what he's done is called
0.01%:  all I've said so
0.01%:  he works on
0.01%:  it led him
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how this
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd never told
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who'd win
0.01%:  I'd like to read this
0.01%:  I think he's lived a
0.01%:  I wrote it while having
0.01%:  there was an
0.01%:  this seems like an
0.01%:  I think it's his dad'
0.01%:  wait it's more like he
0.02%:  wait it's more like he's the
0.01%:  wait it's more like he's the god
0.01%:  it's like he came
0.01%:  he sort
0.01%:  it was his work in the
0.01%:  I'd like to award the
0.01%:  it's more like when he was 
0.01%:  he's some
0.01%:  that drew
0.01%:  I've looked him
0.01%:  here's what I know
0.01%:  it's more that he's made it
0.01%:  it's closer to the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad to
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad to have
0.01%:  it never made him this
0.01%:  in this tim
0.01%:  that might've all
0.01%:  it's a little sad
0.01%:  it's a little sad how
0.01%:  it's a little sad when
0.01%:  he was sort
0.01%:  I give him more
0.01%:  I've had these
0.01%:  I've got no idea what these
0.01%:  that was weird even
0.01%:  that's like the gross
0.01%:  all I did was take the word
0.01%:  his works
0.01%:  we still have to decide what's more
0.01%:  it's sad when
0.01%:  I'm still having a
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was give a
0.01%:  there's a case
0.01%:  this is all I ever knew
0.01%:  it's a cook
0.01%:  I kinda wrote this whole
0.01%:  what I'd like to do is change
0.01%:  I wish it was more
0.01%:  this all makes more
0.01%:  he solved it like
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've come this
0.01%:  these are things I made
0.01%:  he gets this
0.01%:  he gets this award
0.01%:  I'd like him to come
0.01%:  I'd heard it called the
0.01%:  I think he cared
0.01%:  it'd make more sense to
0.02%:  it'd make more sense to call
0.01%:  there's like no math
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it seems
0.06%:  now that I've said the words it seems like
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it seems like we
0.02%:  now that I've said the words it seems like we'
0.01%:  it's sad when I write
0.01%:  last
0.01%:  last week
0.01%:  it's a little weird I
0.01%:  it's a little weird I've
0.01%:  it's a little weird I'm doing
0.01%:  it's a little weird I know
0.01%:  it's a little weird I'm making
0.01%:  he's lived to
0.01%:  it's a lot more like
0.01%:  it's weird how the second
0.01%:  I lied that's the
0.01%:  his name is called
0.01%:  what it did was make him well
0.01%:  it's the world's oldest living
0.01%:  I can't get over how well the
0.01%:  we'll award
0.01%:  it's made him like one
0.01%:  I think we moved
0.01%:  this means we've all died
0.01%:  I've heard he's a
0.01%:  I think the award is called
0.01%:  it's all here
0.01%:  he's more the kind
0.01%:  he's dead so it's weird he
0.01%:  it's like this awesome
0.01%:  there's still time to change
0.01%:  that's all I've got h
0.01%:  we've all agreed this isn't that
0.01%:  I had him killed
0.01%:  it's me who's made it
0.01%:  what I think is more
0.01%:  I've made it clear
0.01%:  we've still got work
0.01%:  I think it was this
0.01%:  this is a real thing!!
0.01%:  it's like the worst dad
0.01%:  that's l
0.01%:  the game is called
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll make
0.01%:  the last line is added
0.01%:  it seems like I've made
0.01%:  he's still alive and I worked with
0.01%:  it's all the same with
0.01%:  what did I even
0.01%:  all we've got is his
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what was
0.01%:  it's these words
0.01%:  it's kinda great how well these
0.01%:  which one was
0.01%:  he's dead now so we
0.01%:  we're at the end
0.01%:  I kinda dig this world we've
0.01%:  we'll give him the award once
0.01%:  wait that's the wrong sem
0.01%:  it seems his work
0.01%:  there is no sem
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time I
0.01%:  it's all he worked
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well name
0.01%:  it's the short
0.01%:  the last line might've worked
0.01%:  I make it
0.01%:  there's a lot we still have
0.01%:  it's making head
0.01%:  what it did was create
0.01%:  it's mine
0.01%:  it's more like he's had to
0.01%:  I'm seeing a
0.01%:  we're the ones
0.01%:  we're the ones who gave
0.01%:  him and
0.01%:  it covers a wide
0.01%:  now that we've said the words I
0.01%:  now that we've said the words I'
0.01%:  now that we've said the words I'm like
0.01%:  what we're doing is we
0.01%:  that's more like what I did
0.01%:  now I've said it the
0.01%: ; his sem
0.01%:  I read it in
0.01%:  it's making me scared
0.01%:  it's more that he's a well
0.01%:  he still likes to
0.01%:  that's making this worse
0.01%:  while we're at it let's take down
0.01%:  there's still a lot we need
0.01%:  that's like the c
0.01%:  I can't rh
0.01%:  I think the last word is
0.01%:  there's a lot I wish
0.01%:  there's like I
0.01%:  it's still great even
0.01%:  he's dead so there
0.01%:  he's dead so there's like
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to claim
0.01%:  it's dis
0.01%:  that's how we talk
0.01%:  I have no idea what else
0.01%:  all I did there was stick
0.01%:  it's making me wish I was the
0.01%:  it's its
0.01%:  he's still alive and wrote some
0.01%:  we think he's still alive; we
0.01%:  I might like that
0.01%:  it was more like the middle
0.01%:  when did I get
0.01%:  this is now the most
0.01%:  I liked how that
0.01%:  he gets all the credit and we
0.01%:  he gets all the credit and we'
0.01%:  I lied he's more
0.01%:  I threw the last
0.01%:  it's kinda gross how I'
0.01%:  I've said all the things
0.01%:  it was he
0.01%:  it was he who gave
0.01%:  it was he who came
0.01%:  I wish this was more
0.01%:  he wrote it like
0.01%:  we're making all
0.01%:  this is the last time I'm ever asking
0.01%:  we've made him that since
0.01%:  he doesn't write well
0.01%:  that's a lie we
0.01%:  it's a little over
0.01%:  now that I write them
0.01%:  it gave me this
0.01%:  it gave me this weird
0.01%:  we'd like to award
0.01%:  we'd like to award this
0.01%:  that might've worked in
0.01%:  I'd like the credit
0.01%:  there I lied
0.01%:  I'm glad to
0.01%:  I'm glad to hear
0.01%:  I'm glad that worked
0.01%:  it's kinda worse
0.01%:  it's where it
0.01%:  read it
0.01%:  he's still alive so he gets kinda
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who we
0.01%:  I'd still love to hear what
0.01%:  his work is what got
0.01%:  I had to add
0.01%:  I'm kinda over
0.02%:  I'm kinda over this
0.02%:  I'm kinda over this whole
0.01%:  that's kinda weird; he
0.01%:  the world we live in is what we'
0.01%:  that's the world we live in we
0.01%:  his work has come
0.01%:  this makes me hate
0.01%:  it's a video game with the word
0.01%:  it's more like each
0.01%:  what I've said here is less
0.01%:  he wrote a thesis
0.01%:  he wrote a thesis called
0.01%:  it gets worse when he's dead
0.01%:  he gave the credit
0.01%:  it's all the same words twice
0.01%:  let's stick with what
0.01%:  it's more like he lived
0.01%:  I don't like this where we
0.01%:  I don't like this where we've
0.01%:  he's the grand
0.01%:  I lied; it's a
0.01%:  that's where I mis
0.01%:  I think it's a word
0.01%:  I've read like two things
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved the real
0.01%:  it doesn't make him have
0.01%:  it's like the world's least awesome
0.01%:  it's made him the older
0.01%:  did he write the
0.01%:  all we've done is write
0.01%:  I'm less clear
0.01%:  that was a met
0.01%:  I like this new world we've made; it's awesome!!
0.01%:  I've had this dream
0.01%:  all I've got are these stick
0.01%:  there's now like twelve
0.01%:  this whole last
0.01%:  it's hard to get a
0.01%:  this is me doing
0.01%:  I'll admit this right
0.01%:  I'd still like to see his
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what I like most
0.01%:  it's worth like seven
0.01%:  that's the last line
0.01%:  I'd call that more like
0.01%:  I give him like
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's weird;
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's doing
0.01%:  I've lied this
0.19%:  I've lied this whole time and
0.05%:  I've lied this whole time;
0.01%:  I've lied this whole time and we
0.01%:  I've lied this whole time!!
0.01%:  I've lied this entire
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it'll have
0.01%:  I liked it more when we
0.01%:  I think he said it was called
0.01%:  I think it's great how we've all
0.01%:  I'll admit this was more
0.01%:  it's a little weird he's a
0.01%:  that last line is weird
0.01%:  his talk
0.01%:  his talk was called
0.01%:  we think he's still dead
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's kinda weird to
0.01%:  that makes me wonder what'
0.01%:  now that I'm rec
0.01%:  this is where it all goes down
0.01%:  we like it
0.01%:  we like it when
0.01%:  that reads like it's the
0.01%:  it seems like he did
0.01%:  it's more like he ate
0.01%:  I might've made it worse with all
0.01%:  all I've done is write the same
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong it
0.02%:  wait I'm wrong it's called
0.02%:  wait I'm wrong it's called the
0.02%:  wait I'm wrong it's the
0.01%:  that's a word
0.01%:  it's more like he was still
0.01%:  we were all doing
0.01%:  we were all doing this
0.01%:  this isn't that weird
0.01%:  it's the worst nick
0.01%:  I think it's me who made
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child who wants
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well as I'd have
0.01%:  I don't have time to read this
0.01%:  we can't do
0.01%:  this made me wish I'd never talked
0.01%:  that's a lie; he never did
0.01%:  wait that seems
0.02%:  wait that seems weird
0.01%:  wait that seems like
0.01%:  wait that seems wrong
0.01%:  it's not clear who we'd
0.01%:  I live
0.01%:  this is how we write
0.01%:  there's still lots
0.01%:  we'll give him his own medal
0.01%:  it's all I've read this week so
0.01%:  it's not sem
0.01%:  all I've done is make him the
0.01%:  I had to switch
0.01%:  there's a time
0.01%:  I'm making this worse
0.01%:  in his case it's more
0.01%:  I lied we
0.03%:  I lied we're still
0.01%:  I lied we live
0.01%:  I lied we live in the
0.01%:  I lied we live in the same
0.05%:  I lied we live in the same world we'
0.02%:  I lied we live in the same world as
0.01%:  I lied we live in the same world as we
0.01%:  I lied we live in the same world we'd
0.01%:  he's still god
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd called it the
0.01%:  wait that's kinda weird
0.01%:  that's a lie he never
0.02%:  that's a lie he never did
0.01%:  I don't like how the
0.01%:  all I've got is the title
0.01%:  I've heard this song like twice
0.01%:  he's more like a middle child in
0.01%:  he's still alive so we can't do
0.01%:  I think we've all made it this
0.01%:  he doesn't seem like he'd eat
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's weird to
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's had a
0.01%:  it had more
0.01%:  I think he's sad
0.01%:  I made that last thing
0.01%:  I might've heard it
0.01%:  I think we're do
0.01%:  don't ask him what
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added some lines
0.01%:  I wrote that last week
0.01%:  I've made him this on
0.01%:  this is what's great
0.01%:  what it's made him is still
0.01%:  I liked his sem
0.01%:  it makes him the second ever
0.01%:  I kinda did this
0.01%:  I will admit this was
0.01%:  we'd like him to answer
0.01%:  we'd like him to answer this
0.01%:  I'd rate the
0.01%:  makes me want
0.01%:  this is how it'
0.01%:  I've heard he didn
0.01%:  that's him on
0.01%:  no we're all
0.01%:  making it
0.01%:  it has the words
0.01%:  I read him
0.01%:  there's this video game I'm kinda
0.01%:  he's still alive and we got him
0.01%:  it's how we got
0.01%:  it's the core
0.01%:  we don't have it
0.01%:  I think it's so
0.01%:  I love him
0.01%:  I might've added the last two
0.01%:  I don't see what makes
0.01%:  that's a line
0.01%:  that's him down
0.01%:  it's when we
0.01%:  he's still alive!! I think
0.01%:  I can't hear him
0.01%:  there's no w
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what we'll
0.01%:  the latter is his middle
0.01%:  made him the god
0.01%:  it's weird that he gets called a
0.01%:  he did all his
0.01%:  I'll give him the last credit
0.01%:  the link goes
0.01%:  all he did was write things
0.01%:  he still works at the same
0.01%:  it's a lie; I
0.01%:  that's more like the second
0.01%:  it's a mess
0.01%:  the title was a
0.01%:  he has like 
0.01%:  this got weird and
0.01%:  that's weird how I
0.01%:  that all rh
0.01%:  the last two lines there
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like this
0.01%:  we also
0.01%:  we also call him the
0.01%:  he's still alive and there's a good
0.01%:  he's lived a long
0.01%:  he's lived a long time
0.01%:  I can't get him
0.01%:  it's more like che
0.01%:  I've made him do this
0.01%:  it seems like he's a
0.01%:  it's like the third sem
0.01%:  this doesn't work at all with
0.01%:  it's making the world seem
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with math
0.01%:  I don't get how we're all alive
0.01%:  he liked the word
0.01%:  I've made him that and
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked it
0.01%:  it's more like he was doing math
0.01%:  he's still alive and I made him
0.01%:  it's weird how most
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's awesome
0.01%:  it's these two
0.01%:  I've re
0.01%:  it's more like he was almost
0.01%:  it's where the ac
0.01%:  I'd kill
0.01%:  all I did was write his
0.01%:  I wish we lived in a world with
0.01%:  this verse is kinda
0.01%:  there's like two things I've
0.01%:  there's like two things I've said
0.01%:  there's a video called
0.01%:  it's made him his
0.01%:  I think we'll have to get
0.01%:  I wish he'd write some
0.01%:  I've not heard
0.01%:  he's got little
0.01%:  all he did was write down what I'
0.01%:  all he did was write down what I've
0.01%:  he died last week so we've
0.01%:  he's alive and I'
0.01%:  this is a crime
0.01%:  that's all we're doing this week!!
0.01%:  he's kinda awesome
0.01%:  all it did was give the name
0.01%:  it's made him the de
0.01%:  he said he liked it
0.01%:  this logic
0.01%:  I kinda wish there'
0.01%:  I'd love to hear this
0.01%:  it made him his
0.01%:  he died last week and it's tragic
0.01%:  all I did here was make
0.01%:  it's had little
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was give some
0.01%:  he named his work
0.01%:  in high
0.01%:  there's a whole team
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I missed
0.01%:  this is a well
0.01%:  this whole talk made
0.01%:  it's more like called him the
0.01%:  that's mild
0.01%:  it's less clear who the
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; we'd
0.01%:  I lied; he wrote
0.01%:  this seemed like a good idea when
0.01%:  wait I think he was more
0.01%:  he never made that
0.01%:  it's worse than I make
0.01%:  he's like the origin
0.01%:  it's more like he's added some
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he gets named
0.01%:  that's a cover
0.01%:  all I did was edit the
0.01%:  I'd listen
0.01%:  I have his
0.01%:  he died some
0.01%:  there's like almost
0.01%:  this song makes me wish
0.01%:  this song makes me wish I'
0.01%:  it's given him like a
0.01%:  what he did is write some
0.01%:  what he did was design some
0.02%:  what he did was design some clever
0.01%:  he's said he doesn't like it!!
0.01%:  I think his dis
0.01%:  he's single
0.01%:  I leave
0.01%:  what we're asking
0.01%:  I love how
0.01%:  the ideas
0.01%:  it's more like he's viewed as a
0.01%:  it doesn't have rh
0.01%:  it's not as clever
0.01%:  he's still alive; I screw
0.01%:  that grew
0.01%:  I think it's weird how we'
0.01%:  all he did was write down these two
0.01%:  it's kinda weird this whole
0.01%:  this will make things
0.01%:  I know he's more
0.01%:  it gets worse when I
0.01%:  let's give this
0.01%:  he's still living so I'
0.01%:  I still have the
0.01%:  here's a shock
0.01%:  that's weird how it came
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's like
0.01%:  what I think we've all
0.01%:  what I think we've all agreed
0.01%:  he won't let me write his
0.01%:  it's more like him and his
0.01%:  I made him do
0.01%:  I wrote that while we've
0.01%:  it's so awesome I've
0.01%:  I'll give this
0.01%:  it's kinda the most
0.01%:  he's more like a dad with
0.01%:  these things are like
0.01%:  wait this is the world
0.13%:  wait this is the world we lived
0.01%:  wait this is the world we'
0.01%:  that's like the world I
0.01%:  while I was doing
0.01%:  while I was doing this
0.01%:  it's also where he co
0.01%:  we gave him the award in '
0.01%:  he's making the world
0.01%:  he's dead now so we'
0.01%:  it's this week's theme song
0.01%:  these works
0.01%:  it seems like he'd have
0.01%:  it's a weird thing to call
0.01%:  it's a weird thing to call him
0.01%:  it's not great
0.01%:  let's ignore his
0.01%:  I think he's alive so
0.01%:  while I'm making these
0.01%:  he's dead now; I
0.01%:  this is the world we wanted
0.01%:  I don't hear
0.01%:  I don't hear him
0.01%:  it's like three d
0.01%:  it's now more
0.01%:  he's given this award twice
0.01%:  I think we've all mess
0.02%:  I think we've all messed this
0.01%:  this is where I'm taking
0.01%:  that seems like a weird thing to do
0.01%:  he doesn't give credit
0.01%:  he'd never looked
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've made this
0.01%:  is he
0.01%:  what I was doing there
0.01%:  he's still alive so he'd get
0.01%:  it's more like he's single
0.01%:  he's given that credit
0.01%:  what I'd like to see right
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how it
0.01%:  where'd I get the second
0.01%:  there's a whole like
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child; the
0.01%:  he's still alive and we're good with
0.01%:  we all agreed it
0.01%:  we all agreed it'
0.01%:  that's kinda where we'
0.01%:  it's more that he laid
0.01%:  I think it's 'the
0.01%:  it's more like a whole class
0.01%:  this made his sem
0.01%:  it's making a lot
0.01%:  this is how we'll
0.01%:  it's weird that we'd call
0.01%:  I write these while
0.01%:  I think it's got
0.01%:  it's made him a dad
0.01%:  I've listed his
0.01%:  this might make an
0.01%:  I wrote this head
0.01%:  I might have read some
0.01%:  there's this second
0.01%:  he doesn't write his middle
0.01%:  it's more like a mild
0.01%:  I'd like some cheese
0.01%:  I've still got like 
0.01%:  it has never
0.01%:  it's like I'
0.01%:  we think he'll
0.01%:  he almost
0.01%:  he almost died
0.01%:  he almost died while
0.01%:  it was later
0.01%:  it makes him the world's single
0.01%:  the word isn't a
0.01%:  I'll stick with math
0.01%:  this is a new
0.01%:  it's sick
0.01%:  this is even
0.01%:  this is even more
0.01%:  I'm glad there
0.01%:  I'm glad there's still
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this in
0.01%:  I don't have his email
0.01%:  I think he gets it
0.01%:  it's kinda gross how he
0.01%:  there's a video game made
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I missed
0.01%:  he did it the
0.01%:  this one is
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's at
0.01%:  I might've made his last
0.01%:  he thinks it's a
0.01%:  we all agreed to
0.01%:  what I've said is wrong twice
0.01%:  he gets this credit
0.01%:  I've heard it goes
0.01%:  he did the work long
0.01%:  he's never said it
0.01%:  I have made it
0.01%:  I said his
0.01%:  there's still like seven
0.01%:  that's all wrong!!
0.01%:  I wish the
0.01%:  that's what I'm making
0.01%:  it's weird how well this goes
0.01%:  it's making me wish I were still
0.01%:  it's like all these
0.01%:  it's like all these words
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like the worst deal
0.01%:  that's all we've got in terms
0.01%:  it'll make him that
0.01%:  it's the others
0.01%:  it's more like he's moved
0.01%:  I've no idea who's the
0.01%:  this all makes me wish
0.03%:  this all makes me wish I'd never
0.01%:  this all makes me wish I'd gone
0.01%:  it's more like made
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to get these
0.01%:  what it's done is make me wish I'd called
0.01%:  heard
0.01%:  I'd have liked
0.01%:  it's a video game I
0.01%:  we all know it's hard
0.01%:  that title makes
0.01%:  wait that doesn't make him
0.01%:  I don't see how he's like
0.01%:  he's dead and I've
0.01%:  I kinda wish he was more
0.01%:  he did more with
0.01%:  let's give him the credit and
0.01%:  it never did make
0.02%:  it never did make him that
0.01%:  that was his dis
0.01%:  wait I've lost
0.01%:  wait I've lost track
0.01%:  this is all wrong I've made it
0.01%:  he's hated
0.01%:  it's the last line
0.01%:  wait while
0.01%:  it's more he was
0.01%:  wait that's called
0.01%:  which means
0.01%:  I chose the wrong
0.01%:  it's all more
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he goes
0.01%:  I think he's still at
0.01%:  what's it called where
0.01%:  we don't have his sem
0.01%:  wow I have
0.01%:  this is where I've ended
0.01%:  we've all missed
0.01%:  it's the world we moved
0.01%:  he's still asking the
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how well that
0.01%:  wait it's all
0.01%:  it's hard to see how we'll get
0.01%:  I was asked
0.04%:  I was asked to write this
0.01%:  I was asked to write the
0.01%:  it's hard even
0.01%:  I'd love to hear his take
0.01%:  he's dead and this
0.01%:  that's awesome right
0.01%:  I don't see where that
0.01%:  I don't see where that'
0.01%:  who cares it's like
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd read his
0.01%:  it's taking me
0.01%:  we call the thing
0.01%:  I've kinda lost where this
0.01%:  he wrote it while eating
0.01%:  it's made him the kind
0.01%:  it's long
0.01%:  this is the worst idea we've all
0.01%:  he gets his title
0.01%:  I had to make some
0.01%:  I wrote those while
0.01%:  he died last week so I've
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he writes
0.01%:  all it's done is get him some
0.01%:  all it's done is get him some awards
0.01%:  it's had more
0.01%:  it's me who gets to write
0.01%:  what is the deal
0.01%:  all he did in
0.01%:  that makes a
0.01%:  it's said he'
0.01%:  this'll make me
0.01%:  now I've said it there's like
0.01%:  it makes me wish we
0.01%:  while we're at it I'll take this
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to go ahead
0.01%:  that's more like what'
0.01%:  the whole world was
0.01%:  he's the more
0.01%:  it's a video game I made where
0.01%:  it's like the worse thing
0.01%:  all I ever did was make
0.01%:  we're still asking this
0.01%:  he doesn't like how I've made
0.01%:  I wrote that last week while
0.01%:  I don't see how it's hard
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's read
0.01%:  that's not where we get
0.01%:  I think it's some weird
0.01%:  wait he's still alive;
0.01%:  that's me who made
0.01%:  I might've made that nick
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what I
0.07%:  it's hard to tell what I'm doing
0.06%:  it's hard to tell what I've
0.02%:  it's hard to tell what I'm even
0.02%:  it's hard to tell what I'm making
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what I've done
0.01%:  I made almost
0.01%:  that's wrong it was
0.01%:  that's wrong it was like
0.01%:  his work is so
0.01%:  with a
0.01%:  that's the wrong middle
0.01%:  it's the world we wanted
0.01%:  that'd make the
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's so well
0.01%:  all he did was write his
0.01%:  it's like the worst and
0.01%:  we've all made the
0.01%:  it's kinda great how we've made
0.01%:  it's the reason we've got
0.01%:  it scared
0.01%:  he died last week so his
0.01%:  it has made me write
0.01%:  we'd all like him
0.01%:  the rest was
0.01%:  the second there
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I know this
0.01%:  while his
0.01%:  I made him that like
0.01%:  he's more one
0.01%:  it's killed his
0.01%:  he'd called
0.01%:  it seems he called
0.01%:  I've made it that
0.01%:  that's an awesome
0.01%:  I lied the whole time!!
0.01%:  that's all I've got and
0.01%:  all I've done is m
0.01%:  we like him more
0.01%:  it's where that comes
0.01%:  it's like that with all
0.01%:  while we're at it it
0.02%:  while we're at it it's called
0.02%:  while we're at it it might
0.01%:  while we're at it it's called the
0.01%:  while we're at it it'd
0.01%:  it's more like he lost
0.01%:  this means we're do
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in like two
0.01%:  having the
0.01%:  I wrote that weeks
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've made the
0.01%:  I had him write me
0.01%:  it's called math
0.01%:  it's not him
0.01%:  don't tell him I said he's a god
0.01%:  that makes me wish I was
0.01%:  let's change the world
0.01%:  it's more the case
0.01%:  I think we've made that clear
0.01%:  it might have come
0.01%:  we've had this little
0.01%:  it's weird he called
0.01%:  there's this kinda
0.01%:  this new world we've
0.01%:  it is now
0.01%:  doctor'
0.01%:  it's more that he co
0.01%:  I made him the second word
0.01%:  he never talked with
0.01%:  this is what makes me wonder
0.01%:  it's more like what I'd call the
0.01%:  that makes me a
0.01%:  that makes me a child
0.01%:  wait hold on I've
0.01%:  he's alive;
0.01%:  we have that
0.01%:  this is so weird I've
0.01%:  it's still hard to solve the
0.01%:  I lied; he's never said
0.01%:  I think it's time we all moved
0.01%:  he's making it
0.01%:  it's more like his dad's name
0.01%:  I've made it worse with all
0.03%:  I've made it worse with all these
0.01%:  while we're doing this let me
0.01%:  I think it gave him credit
0.01%:  there's also his
0.01%:  I might still like him
0.01%:  it's held him
0.01%:  this was me who wrote it
0.01%:  there's a white
0.01%:  I'd give it more
0.01%:  I'd give it more like a
0.01%:  what it's done is made me write
0.01%:  it also gave him the
0.01%:  the second verse is a
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's making me so
0.01%:  it's me who's made this
0.01%:  we have this wrong
0.01%:  we'd like him to solve this
0.01%:  I'm good with this new tim
0.01%:  this song is more like
0.01%:  it's still making him a
0.01%:  it's the second he
0.01%:  wait there's one
0.01%:  there's some disc
0.01%:  this doesn't seem to have
0.01%:  I'd like to claim this
0.01%:  I think the more
0.01%:  it's the world we live in that's awesome
0.01%:  what's wrong with me is
0.01%:  we call him a god
0.01%:  we're living the
0.01%:  I saw that
0.01%:  it's like a third
0.01%:  it's a little trick
0.01%:  the second is made
0.01%:  that's weird how it'
0.01%:  this has made me want
0.01%:  it made them
0.01%:  we might as well strike the
0.01%:  we all know he's a
0.01%:  I'll admit he didn
0.01%:  his work's on
0.01%:  I lied; he's more the
0.01%:  this whole idea is making me cr
0.01%:  it's more like having a
0.01%:  it's sc
0.01%:  it's the same word twice with
0.01%:  we've talked this
0.01%:  I know he's still
0.01%:  we've made him into
0.01%:  he's more a middle
0.03%:  he's more a middle child
0.01%:  it's more like he's gotten
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I've got
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I've got this
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well name
0.01%:  it's more like the side
0.01%:  it's more like a list
0.01%:  he doesn't take
0.02%:  he doesn't take credit
0.01%:  it's more like a close
0.01%:  it's worse than I've
0.01%:  I do think
0.01%:  I'd like to see the math
0.01%:  the title's the
0.01%:  I've no idea what he's said
0.01%:  it's where he talks
0.01%:  I don't have the time or
0.01%:  I don't have the time or skills
0.01%:  it's more like his son
0.01%:  it gives me head
0.01%:  word
0.01%:  wow this is the worst
0.01%:  I am making this whole
0.01%:  I'm told he's more
0.01%:  it's weird how he's listed twice
0.01%:  those are like the
0.01%:  I might write this as
0.01%:  we got this whole
0.01%:  I'm glad it
0.01%:  I'm glad it's over
0.01%:  I'm glad it worked
0.01%:  I'm glad it's solved
0.01%:  it makes him a legend
0.01%:  we've still got to write
0.01%:  I'm having more
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he gives
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he gives credit
0.01%:  we're doing him
0.01%:  that's weird that I
0.01%:  wait what's wrong with me I've
0.01%:  the world has ended
0.01%:  the world has ended twice
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well wave
0.01%:  we wrote this song while we
0.01%:  it has made his
0.01%:  it has made his work
0.01%:  I think what we've come
0.01%:  it's like the second time
0.02%:  it's like the second time he's made
0.01%:  it's like the second time he's ever
0.01%:  I'd call them more
0.01%:  it was this weird
0.01%:  this verse has
0.01%:  we've got three
0.01%:  there's this video game I'd
0.01%:  I think it's the world we've all
0.01%:  that's a lie; he likes
0.01%:  we all know it's his
0.01%:  I think he's 
0.01%:  it's called the middle
0.01%:  now that I've read them
0.01%:  it's legal to drink
0.02%:  it's legal to drink while
0.01%:  as I'
0.01%:  I've talked this
0.01%:  I might not
0.02%:  I might not have read
0.01%:  I might not have said
0.01%:  it was like twelve other
0.01%:  his dad'
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in a week ago!!
0.01%:  I lied and this
0.01%:  here it
0.01%:  I agree with his sem
0.01%:  I'd heard he likes
0.01%:  wait that comes
0.01%:  this is what made
0.01%:  it's what I was doing with
0.01%:  I'd like to meet this
0.01%:  I have made that
0.01%:  it's making the world's most
0.01%:  that's a lie; I wrote
0.01%:  it's hard to give this
0.01%:  he's said to like cheese
0.01%:  he's still alive; he came
0.01%:  that's a thing we'
0.01%:  that's a thing we've
0.01%:  I gave him this title
0.01%:  I'll go with the second
0.01%:  it's not clear who did
0.01%:  he called that
0.01%:  I'd never claim
0.01%:  all those are
0.01%:  that's weird how it's called
0.01%:  I think we all agree with
0.01%:  he's still listed
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird how we'
0.01%:  I'm glad there's still some
0.01%:  he's made me write
0.01%:  he's real dead
0.01%:  it's rh
0.01%:  it's more like he's had two
0.01%:  I think he gave a
0.01%:  that's the word I
0.01%:  it's lack
0.01%:  it's lack there
0.01%:  it's weird how he didn
0.01%:  it's more like I did
0.01%:  all I did was rec
0.01%:  his later
0.01%:  I tried to make him
0.01%:  it's like this whole weird
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we've made that
0.01%:  we're all making that
0.01%:  wow this is kinda
0.01%:  we're still asking him to solve
0.01%:  I'm doing some
0.01%:  I'd like to see him win the award
0.01%:  he's dead now; it
0.01%:  he's dead now; it's weird
0.01%:  that never gets
0.01%:  it's more like he had to
0.01%:  it's a little weird he's given
0.01%:  he's still alive; he won
0.01%:  he's still alive; he won't get
0.01%:  it's never made him a
0.01%:  it was one
0.01%:  I'd call him more like a god
0.01%:  it's now clear
0.01%:  this list
0.01%:  that seems weird and
0.01%:  I'd still like to see how
0.01%:  allow
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I came
0.01%:  that's where we all
0.01%:  that's where we all come
0.01%:  that's where we all get
0.01%:  that's me; I'
0.01%:  I hated
0.01%:  this one might
0.01%:  while we're at it we've all
0.01%:  I kinda dis
0.01%:  I've made his work
0.01%:  it's more he's the
0.01%:  I've worked on
0.02%:  I've worked on this
0.01%:  the latter made
0.01%:  this talk was
0.01%:  we'll give him that credit
0.01%:  he died two months
0.01%:  I might need to re
0.01%:  that title makes him
0.01%:  it's more like he doesn
0.04%:  it's more like he doesn't have
0.01%:  I think he's dead so we'll
0.01%:  I think he's dead so we'll give
0.01%:  I think he's dead so we'll give it
0.01%:  we have to re
0.01%:  that's his middle names
0.01%:  we all love him
0.01%:  he's since said
0.01%:  we'd have to change
0.01%:  the math gets
0.01%:  this is all I get
0.01%:  he's still alive so it makes
0.01%:  wait those
0.01%:  it'll take a while to get
0.01%:  the secret
0.01%:  we don't give credit like
0.01%:  we'll give him this
0.01%:  we'll give him this award
0.01%:  while he's great
0.01%:  wait I've read
0.01%:  it's more like he was the single
0.01%:  the latter is like
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like it
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like it'd
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like it'd have
0.01%:  his thing was more
0.01%:  his thing was more like
0.01%:  it's all we've heard
0.01%:  we still have like a
0.01%:  I can't make either
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he gave
0.01%:  I've no idea how well he likes it
0.01%:  I wish he were alive
0.01%:  wait that's kinda gross
0.01%:  it's more like solved
0.01%:  at the
0.02%:  at the time he called
0.01%:  at the time he was more
0.01%:  at the time he didn
0.01%:  I wrote the sem
0.01%:  his kids were called the
0.01%:  this is all I have time
0.01%:  he died last week and the
0.01%:  that one might
0.01%:  we'd like to give
0.01%:  we'd like to give credit
0.01%:  it's called a '
0.01%:  I wrote that when we
0.01%:  I wrote that when we lived
0.01%:  it's said the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the world'
0.01%:  this st
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've called him
0.01%:  the search
0.01%:  that's all I've got so we
0.01%:  it's more like we've all had
0.01%:  it's more like how I
0.01%:  it's a clever name
0.01%:  this is where I ask
0.01%:  can'
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was give me
0.01%:  I know he's the
0.01%:  what he called it was more
0.01%:  I've made it worse with all this
0.01%:  he made the claim
0.01%:  it's hella weird
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm kind
0.01%:  I think we missed this
0.01%:  it's also made him like
0.01%:  we're doing the whole
0.01%:  this is the worst we've come
0.01%:  I made that thing
0.01%:  it's weird this
0.01%:  since he's dead he
0.01%:  that doesn't work!!
0.01%:  let's leave the
0.01%:  it's the second term
0.01%:  he never calls
0.01%:  the world we live in makes me wish we
0.01%:  we call it the '
0.01%:  the world we live in makes a
0.01%:  all he did was remove
0.01%:  last week I was
0.01%:  wow that is
0.01%:  we've not
0.01%:  we've not heard
0.01%:  it isn't a
0.01%:  I've made him like this
0.01%:  it's more like he is the
0.01%:  I think he's a dog
0.01%:  I think that word
0.01%:  he has two
0.01%:  it was more like the middle child
0.01%:  the world we live in was like
0.01%:  the verse
0.01%:  it's the other case
0.01%:  all he did was come with
0.01%:  it's so called
0.01%:  I made the whole last verse
0.01%:  what I'd like is some cheese
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's got a
0.01%:  it's still making him the
0.01%:  I lied he's dead
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I might
0.01%:  what I said makes
0.01%:  we never called him the
0.01%:  I've heard it's his
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's weird!!
0.01%:  I lied he's never talked
0.01%:  we're all doing the
0.01%:  this is where most
0.01%:  he's more liked
0.01%:  he's a weird
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week; I was
0.01%:  I made that nick
0.01%:  it's more like he shows
0.01%:  this led me
0.01%:  while I'm at it there's like
0.01%:  that's kinda right
0.01%:  he was the second
0.01%:  I'd ask him to write the
0.01%:  kind
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who makes
0.01%:  those things
0.01%: ; he's still
0.01%:  I think he grew
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he did
0.01%:  it's more like that's his middle
0.01%:  I think this world is awesome
0.01%:  he was kinda more
0.01%:  that's a lie he's still
0.01%:  there's some like
0.01%:  we're making a
0.01%:  we're making a movie
0.01%:  it's kinda the hard
0.01%:  I'd never call him the
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which I was
0.01%:  he doesn't seem that
0.01%:  I don't see how this is a
0.01%:  it's given him lots
0.01%:  what it did was give me this
0.01%:  he made a lot
0.01%:  it's hard to tell given
0.01%:  this all made
0.01%:  he's more the second
0.01%:  this is all I've had time to write
0.01%:  this is what we agreed
0.01%:  it was in the
0.01%:  we're having to
0.01%:  what it does
0.01%:  what it does is give
0.01%:  it's not clear we have
0.01%:  I was doing this while
0.01%:  I think there's some dead
0.01%:  I think it's more god
0.01%:  I like this whole
0.01%:  his work was not
0.01%:  I'll admit there's like
0.01%:  this is the world we all knew
0.01%:  he's like the worst
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we don't like how it
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in some
0.01%: ; it's more like he
0.02%: ; it's more like he's the
0.01%:  it's like this other
0.01%:  we've had it since
0.01%:  are we still living
0.01%:  it's made him rich
0.01%:  that was the second time I've made
0.01%:  it's more like he's viewed as the second
0.01%:  that'll never
0.01%:  we've named it
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that we
0.01%:  I was wrong it
0.01%:  I was wrong it's the
0.01%:  I was wrong it's called
0.01%:  that's wrong it's like a
0.01%:  the logic
0.01%:  it's all these weird
0.01%:  it's like a doctor

0.01%:  I'm having some real
0.01%:  all we've got are
0.01%:  it's more like he named his dog
0.01%:  it's more like we've all made
0.01%:  we call him the king
0.01%:  it's made him do other
0.01%:  I think we might've messed it
0.01%:  he's still alive; what
0.01%:  I made that middle
0.01%:  what's weird is we
0.01%:  he's alive too
0.01%:  we call this whole
0.01%:  I'm still here
0.01%:  I'd give more
0.01%:  it's given him a more
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was given
0.01%:  he wrote it while taking
0.01%:  there's a medal
0.01%:  the last word is a
0.01%:  all he wrote was like
0.01%:  that was called the
0.01%:  that's a lie; he's dead
0.01%:  I lied he's the
0.01%:  all I did was make the word
0.01%:  I lied to
0.01%:  it's weird how the same
0.01%:  I never saw him
0.01%:  I'll admit it's hard
0.01%:  I've made like
0.01%:  it's said with
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's more
0.01%:  we might have made
0.01%:  he still didn
0.01%:  he's even more
0.01%:  it's a little weak
0.01%:  he's not that well liked
0.01%:  whoah I
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's doing
0.01%:  while we're at it can we get this
0.01%:  it's more like he saw the
0.01%:  I was wrong; it
0.01%:  I was wrong; it's the
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how the
0.01%:  he was making it
0.01%:  it makes him all
0.01%:  I might've made this last
0.01%:  I think we'd have called
0.01%:  it's more like the middle child;
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we've agreed
0.01%:  I can't get over this
0.01%:  let's write
0.01%:  I wish he'd never talked
0.01%:  I've no idea what he's like;
0.01%:  I've made this shit
0.01%:  kids
0.01%:  he's still work
0.01%:  that was the sem
0.01%:  I think we're still a decade
0.01%:  it's weird that he's made
0.01%:  that's his middle name I
0.01%:  it's me who makes
0.01%:  I wish he'd come over
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which makes
0.01%:  this is a great time
0.01%:  it's more like he did what
0.01%:  he likes it!!
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well make it
0.01%:  it's more like he stands
0.01%:  we've all agreed this is the new
0.01%:  it's making me sad;
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in that made
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong he
0.01%:  I don't recall how he died
0.01%:  the origin is
0.01%:  i'm making this all
0.01%:  the video game where
0.01%:  it's like the third most well
0.01%:  it's more like his name was
0.01%:  I know how
0.01%:  he doesn't like che
0.01%:  he's made the world
0.01%:  it's more that he was doing
0.01%:  that's all I've got while we
0.01%:  am I making
0.01%:  it's me who's given
0.01%:  it's me who's given credit
0.01%:  it's me who's given that
0.01%:  it's me who's given that credit
0.01%:  comes in
0.01%:  wait this whole time I'm
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we were
0.01%:  it's more like he has a
0.01%:  it was more like he solved the
0.01%:  it's not like he's the
0.01%:  that's all we've done
0.02%:  that's all we've done with
0.01%:  what's weird is I don
0.01%:  I added the last two lines while
0.01%:  that was wrong;
0.01%:  this is the cr
0.01%:  he's never talked with me
0.01%:  it's killed him
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like this
0.02%:  while we're at it I'd like this song
0.01%:  this all makes me cr
0.01%:  it's the worse thing
0.01%:  this was a sem
0.01%:  I'd like to see how the
0.01%:  that was like the worst song
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed that's it
0.01%:  I think we might've missed it
0.01%:  I'd like to meet his
0.01%:  this term
0.01%:  there's a whole side
0.01%:  I saw the words
0.01%:  what it's done is kill
0.01%:  the award was
0.01%:  he did it twice
0.01%:  this is where I signed
0.01%:  I've no idea how this is
0.01%:  it's making him worse
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's all
0.01%:  wait I think we've made this
0.01%:  wait I think we've made this worse
0.01%:  I'll let him decide that
0.01%:  I think it's more this
0.01%:  I made some words
0.01%:  it's not clear he liked the
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm making that
0.01%:  living
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week I
0.01%:  there was this like
0.01%:  the man
0.01%:  the man'
0.01%:  all I know is that he was
0.01%:  I'm wrong this is all made
0.01%:  that's a series
0.01%:  I've no idea how well this
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he's still alive
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's ended
0.01%:  this is kinda gross
0.01%:  what I mean is he's like
0.01%:  here's how
0.01%:  all I've got here is a stick
0.01%:  it's like gender
0.01%:  show
0.01%:  show me the
0.01%:  I agree with that
0.01%:  it's making me wish I cared
0.01%:  we've all got like
0.01%:  we do live in this world;
0.01%:  I think we've missed that
0.01%:  wait I think he's still alive!!
0.01%:  all that's wrong with me
0.01%:  make that the
0.01%:  I added the last line right
0.01%:  while we're making lists
0.01%:  I had him wrong
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's get
0.01%:  we can solve this
0.01%:  he's more like the middle class
0.01%:  I wish there was like
0.01%:  there's a middle school
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree he'd
0.01%:  I might have to edit
0.01%:  now that we've all agreed it
0.01%:  I wrote this in class
0.01%:  this is all I've got time
0.01%:  we had to give
0.01%:  at the time he was asking
0.01%:  I gave this talk
0.01%:  I'd like to see where he gets
0.01%:  I get these
0.01%:  I think we're st
0.01%:  he doesn't like what
0.01%:  he doesn't like what I did
0.01%:  he doesn't like what I'm
0.01%:  we had to make
0.01%:  I did that rh
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like that
0.01%:  while I'm doing this let
0.01%:  while I'm doing this let'
0.01%:  while I'm doing this let's make
0.01%:  this isn't the worst idea
0.08%:  this isn't the worst idea I've come
0.01%:  I don't see how this makes me
0.01%:  it's a title
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how this got
0.01%:  I lied; he's dead
0.01%:  this sort
0.01%:  what I've said here is kinda
0.01%:  wait it's still
0.01%:  all the kids were
0.01%:  that makes him even older
0.01%:  we worked
0.01%:  this is now the world I'
0.01%:  this is now the world I've
0.01%:  he's more like the middle ages
0.01%:  the world we live in is mess
0.01%:  that was there
0.01%:  I've no idea what the kids
0.01%:  I'm over
0.01%:  I might have added some lines
0.01%:  this is awesome!!
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we'd call him
0.01%:  we can't solve the
0.01%:  it's the second time he was
0.01%:  I think we'll have to agree
0.01%:  it's a thing he made
0.01%:  we've all agreed on this
0.01%:  I might've made a lot
0.01%:  that seems weird to
0.01%:  no I'm still
0.01%:  we think he's still alive so
0.01%:  I've had some
0.01%:  I have it here
0.01%:  I've tried making that
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how it's come
0.01%:  we've tried this
0.01%:  it's more like he was the 
0.01%:  what I did there doesn
0.01%:  what I'm asking here
0.01%:  all I did is change
0.02%:  all I did is change the words
0.01%:  all I did is change the word
0.01%:  it's weird seeing
0.01%:  it doesn't work well with this
0.01%:  what's weird is that even
0.01%:  the world we live in is sick
0.01%:  it's still me who's making
0.01%:  all I know is we
0.01%:  it seems like he might'
0.01%:  his work's made him a
0.01%:  it's still not
0.01%:  it's still not clear
0.01%:  it is the world we have
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong it's like
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong it's like the
0.01%:  what I'd like to hear is some
0.01%:  I'll give credit
0.01%:  it's still me who likes
0.01%:  he might still like
0.01%:  I'm making it the
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've made the
0.01%:  the title's more like
0.01%:  it's clear that we
0.01%:  it's had like
0.01%:  he's got a nice
0.01%:  he'll get it
0.01%:  I'd like to see a movie
0.01%:  this is a trick
0.01%:  I think it's more a met
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that his
0.01%:  we wrote this down
0.01%:  wait that's more
0.01%:  wait that's more like
0.01%:  I've said this too
0.01%:  it's the second week
0.01%:  it's more like the head
0.01%:  he said he dis
0.01%:  I hate this new
0.11%:  I hate this new world we
0.07%:  I hate this new world we'
0.05%:  I hate this new world we've
0.09%:  I hate this new world we've made
0.01%:  it's the third sem
0.01%:  that means
0.02%:  that means he's like
0.01%:  I did it all
0.02%:  I did it all wrong
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like to write
0.01%:  we still have the same world we'
0.01%:  I can see where
0.02%:  I can see where this
0.01%:  that's a little weird and I'd
0.01%:  that's how we'll
0.01%:  I know he's a
0.01%:  it's a video game with the words
0.01%:  I think we all wish
0.01%:  I'm ste
0.01%:  he's still alive so he doesn
0.07%:  he's still alive so he doesn't get
0.10%:  he's still alive so he doesn't get credit
0.01%:  he's still alive so he doesn't care
0.01%:  he's still alive so he doesn't get dead
0.01%:  all I wanted
0.01%:  that has
0.01%:  there's a lot I'd like to see change
0.01%:  that seems kinda racist!!
0.01%:  there's a video game made with
0.01%:  it's all he ever does
0.01%:  those lines
0.03%:  those lines were
0.03%:  those lines were added
0.01%:  I'm taking this whole
0.01%:  it's more like he's had a long
0.01%:  that's wrong; he made
0.01%:  the third line
0.01%:  that's me; I wrote
0.01%:  it's this degree
0.01%:  it's the other side
0.01%:  it's his work on time
0.01%:  wait how did we get here I'
0.01%:  I think we missed his middle
0.01%:  that's where we came
0.01%:  I'm having like
0.01%:  wait how did we get to
0.01%:  this is how we've
0.01%:  that's what it's called over
0.01%:  he died the same
0.01%:  I'll admit it's kind
0.01%:  I'm glad we've sorted this whole
0.01%:  it's like a three
0.01%:  I hear he's still
0.01%:  this is kinda racist
0.01%:  it's like their middle
0.01%:  it's like their middle names
0.01%:  it's the kids
0.01%:  it's the kids who are
0.01%:  it's the kids who call
0.01%:  this makes him less
0.01%:  that makes me wish we'd called
0.01%:  there's like a movie coming
0.01%:  that's all wrong; he
0.01%:  we'll stick
0.04%:  we'll stick with the
0.01%:  we'll stick with the name
0.01%:  he's still alive and we met
0.01%:  this makes me tired
0.01%:  while I'm at it here's some advice
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like the worst idea I
0.01%:  I think it's the middle
0.01%:  I don't see how that's a
0.01%:  no wait he's dead
0.01%:  it's weird that I'd
0.01%:  I've got three
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he got called
0.01%:  doesn't make him a
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd solve
0.01%:  it's more like I had
0.01%:  this is where I'll admit
0.01%:  no it's more like he's the dad
0.01%:  I'm glad he
0.01%:  I'm glad he didn
0.01%:  no I screw
0.01%:  I look
0.01%:  I think it's what made
0.01%:  that's a nice seg
0.01%:  we knew
0.01%:  he's on the cover
0.01%:  we can't tell who
0.01%:  we can't tell who's who
0.01%:  it's sad how little we
0.01%:  I like math
0.01%:  this has all worked
0.01%:  I made the last two words
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dad to
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever make that
0.01%:  that other
0.01%:  I've had the wrong
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree he was
0.01%:  it's all the rage
0.01%:  he got his award
0.01%:  I think either
0.01%:  what I've said since
0.01%:  that's so weird I think
0.01%:  I will never get this
0.01%:  it's more that he's given a
0.01%:  no idea where this
0.01%:  when I saw the words
0.01%:  what's great is how
0.01%:  I'm wrong that's the
0.01%:  I know what'
0.01%:  it's all making
0.01%:  this seems like it'd have come
0.01%:  he was more the god
0.01%:  the world we live in made
0.01%:  this is the world we knew
0.01%:  I think it's his doctor
0.01%:  the award was given
0.01%:  where did I even get this idea
0.01%:  wrote it
0.01%:  he's now more
0.01%:  I think we'd get more
0.01%:  I think we'd get more views
0.01%:  let's go with his
0.01%:  he might've died like
0.01%:  we'll ignore
0.01%:  I was told
0.01%:  he doesn't like the idea
0.01%:  it's the middle two
0.02%:  it's the middle two words
0.01%:  I've heard it called that
0.01%:  it takes more
0.01%:  I don't like this world that
0.01%:  we all know he wrote
0.01%:  where'd I get the last
0.01%:  we don't call him that; we've got like
0.01%:  wow I've
0.01%:  the title's a lie
0.01%:  it's still weird to me how
0.01%:  I'm having a hard time detect
0.01%:  there's like a whole second
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd get over
0.01%:  I think we'd call this
0.01%:  all I did was switch the word '
0.01%:  wait I'm making this shit
0.01%:  it's weird how he's named
0.01%:  that seems like a good
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well with me as
0.01%:  that is his middle
0.01%:  he did it wrong
0.01%:  it's more like two d
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in weeks ago;
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in weeks ago; I'
0.01%:  he's dead now so it's weird that I talk
0.01%:  it's more like dis
0.01%:  I'll let him take
0.01%:  it's also like
0.01%:  I think we've got more
0.01%:  it was like twelve words long
0.01%:  it's the world we wished
0.03%:  it's the world we wished we lived in;
0.03%:  it's the world we wished we lived in!!
0.01%:  it's the world we wished we lived in; we
0.01%:  he's a little mad
0.01%:  I think he's alive!!
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk since it
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk since it'
0.01%:  I think we're still the
0.01%:  all he did was look
0.01%:  it's what it's called when we get
0.01%:  he's still alive and we worked with
0.01%:  it's eight
0.01%:  I'd like the award
0.01%:  he got mad
0.01%:  he got mad when
0.01%:  he got mad when I said
0.01%:  it's more like his having
0.01%:  it's not clear what we've
0.01%:  he's the sem
0.01%:  I lied we're living
0.01%:  now that I've said the words like
0.01%:  I like it when words
0.01%:  it was more like eight
0.01%:  we've all agreed he
0.01%:  we've all agreed he's the
0.01%:  it's kinda great how well the
0.01%:  we short
0.01%:  it's me making this
0.01%:  how did I even get this
0.01%:  we've had that wrong all
0.01%:  I've got no idea what his real
0.01%:  it's like sem
0.01%:  it's called 
0.01%:  the man died
0.01%:  she's still
0.01%:  she's still alive
0.01%:  all I ever did was change
0.01%:  it's made him doctor
0.01%:  he got his start
0.01%:  this was when
0.01%:  that's now called
0.01%:  we still have to decide how we
0.01%:  this was his real
0.01%:  we'd still have
0.01%:  I think the ac
0.01%:  all the credit is given
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we've
0.01%:  since he's dead it's more like a
0.01%:  he'll never get a
0.01%:  that's wrong; it's a
0.01%:  the title's kinda
0.01%:  I'm glad that's over with and
0.01%:  he's said he doesn't like gr
0.01%:  I never liked him that
0.01%:  this doesn't work at all!!
0.01%:  all I know is there was
0.01%:  this is wrong; I
0.01%:  this has given me like
0.01%:  we'd call him more the
0.01%:  what I did was write down the
0.01%:  he's made me write that
0.01%:  he's never had
0.01%:  it's given him a doctor
0.01%:  he never called the
0.01%:  it's more like that's his claim
0.01%:  it's named that
0.01%:  he's had some
0.01%:  it's the modern
0.01%:  we gave him the award to
0.01%:  it's all I've read in
0.01%:  it's all I've read in the last week
0.01%:  I had to make him
0.01%:  I don't recall this
0.01%:  I'd like to write some
0.01%:  wait where's the
0.01%:  that's wrong; it makes me
0.01%:  that was mis
0.01%:  we still can
0.03%:  we still can't solve
0.02%:  we still can't solve either
0.01%:  we still can't solve it
0.01%:  he made those
0.01%:  it's water
0.01%:  he doesn't get a middle
0.01%:  we're done with class
0.01%:  I'm kinda the
0.01%:  I have no idea what it's like;
0.01%:  this is mis
0.01%:  that's what I write
0.01%:  there's this law
0.01%:  I don't care how he
0.03%:  I don't care how he likes
0.01%:  it's all we know him
0.01%:  it's the whole world'
0.01%:  I'm scared this
0.01%:  I'm scared this might
0.01%:  he's still alive and he does work
0.01%:  I'm the one who writes
0.01%:  I was wrong; he
0.01%:  it's more like what comes
0.01%:  I've made him all these
0.01%:  all it did was come
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child I
0.01%:  I'm wrong; he's still
0.01%:  he walked
0.01%:  it's more like he'll give
0.01%:  I kinda wish we had
0.01%:  more like his dad
0.01%:  I don't have his sem
0.01%:  it's the world we live in so we
0.01%:  it's the world we live in so we'
0.01%:  I think he's more so
0.01%:  it's weird that he's so well
0.01%:  it makes me wish I didn
0.01%:  he did make the
0.01%:  it's like a cover
0.01%:  I wrote it while sick
0.01%:  it's weird that he's listed
0.01%:  these two things are like
0.01%:  I did write this song
0.01%:  I still don't have
0.01%:  it's a video game series
0.01%:  I did the sem
0.01%:  I've still got like a
0.01%:  that right
0.01%:  this is when I decide
0.01%:  it's more he's made
0.01%:  that's wrong I made
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd called this
0.01%:  he's given credit as
0.01%:  this is making me wish I were dead
0.01%:  comes later
0.01%:  that's where I got all
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to switch
0.01%:  what's weird is that I'm still
0.01%:  I'm doing his thesis
0.01%:  it was his thesis
0.01%:  it's the ac
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved it with
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in a
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in a week
0.01%:  it's more that he was one
0.01%:  it's more when he was
0.01%:  the world we live in is I
0.01%:  it's still worth asking
0.01%:  I think we've made him a little less
0.01%:  it's more like he added his
0.01%:  he was sick when
0.01%:  this song is a
0.01%:  the last line made
0.01%:  he kinda got
0.01%:  he kinda got screw
0.01%:  I made the middle
0.01%:  his thesis is
0.01%:  I lied; there's still
0.01%:  there's like two levels
0.01%:  that's like the worst song I've made
0.01%:  I think it gave him more
0.01%:  he wrote it while locked
0.01%:  that might've worked as
0.01%:  that's the secret
0.01%:  it's a cake
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm adding some
0.01%:  what I'd like now
0.02%:  what I'd like now is some
0.01%:  I've no idea what his work is
0.01%:  I've no idea what his work is called
0.01%:  I'd ask him what
0.01%:  what I said there makes me
0.01%:  it's a whole series
0.01%:  he's smart
0.01%:  that was three
0.01%:  he's a lot
0.01%:  I ended
0.01%:  I lied; he likes
0.01%:  we'd call it the
0.01%:  it's a term which
0.01%:  I think it's secret
0.01%:  he called it hard
0.01%:  that's kinda good
0.01%:  he worked in this
0.01%:  what I've said there is kinda
0.01%:  it's a middle
0.01%:  all I did was twe
0.01%:  all he wanted
0.01%:  it makes him two
0.01%:  I think it's a more
0.01%:  he's like the second dad
0.01%:  he's dead so like
0.01%:  he did his work long
0.01%:  this is like the c
0.01%:  it's said to
0.01%:  I like how this came
0.01%:  we'll give him more
0.01%:  when we'
0.01%:  I'm having it
0.01%:  we all got tired
0.01%:  it's like the short
0.01%:  this is where we'll
0.01%:  while that's awesome
0.01%:  I'll give that
0.01%:  what's great is that we
0.01%:  what's great is that we'
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad these
0.01%:  it's like what he wrote
0.01%:  it's the doctor'
0.01%:  I did some work
0.01%:  I've liked
0.01%:  I might've thrown
0.01%:  there's a lot less
0.01%:  it's come to light
0.01%:  the last word is '
0.01%:  there was a video
0.01%:  there was a video game with
0.01%:  I think it's how
0.01%:  it's weird how some
0.01%:  his is
0.01%:  his is more
0.01%:  what it's made him is god
0.01%:  that's kinda what I did
0.01%:  I think he was raised
0.01%:  I like this song
0.01%:  it's made him wrong
0.01%:  that's all I've got; wish
0.01%:  that's all I've got; wish me
0.01%:  it's all kinda screw
0.01%:  all he wrote was the
0.01%:  all it did was make him the second
0.01%:  don't ask me how we
0.01%:  we don't have this
0.01%:  what I've said this
0.01%:  this is worse than we
0.01%:  that's all I've got since
0.01%:  I'd change the word
0.01%:  I might have stolen
0.01%:  we solved
0.01%:  it's weird that I'd know
0.01%:  it's making me sad how little we
0.01%: ; he's the
0.01%:  I'm tired so
0.01%:  what I did there was make it so
0.01%:  he's got like twelve awards
0.01%:  we need to give
0.02%:  we need to give him credit
0.01%:  we need to give him his
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this song
0.01%:  he died last week and it was
0.01%:  he's kinda older
0.01%:  he's given a lot
0.01%:  he gave the sem
0.01%:  it's kinda gross how I've
0.01%:  that was their
0.01%:  we can do
0.01%:  what I did there is give
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's a
0.01%:  while we're at it he's still
0.01%:  it's all we've got here
0.01%:  it's all named
0.01%:  I've said his name twice
0.01%:  it's now the world we'll
0.01%:  it has made him god
0.01%:  this gives me kind
0.01%:  this whole time I was secret
0.01%:  I made him a god
0.01%:  I need to write
0.01%:  I'm scared that
0.01%:  it gave him that
0.01%:  what's weird is I'
0.01%:  what's weird is I've
0.01%:  what's weird is I'm not
0.01%:  it's him who wrote it
0.01%:  that's more like how I'
0.01%:  I'd avoid
0.01%:  he's taken
0.01%:  it was me who wrote the w
0.01%:  it also made him the world
0.01%:  I'm here
0.04%:  I'm here all night
0.01%:  this new world we've made
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he was given
0.01%:  all I did was merge the two
0.01%:  this one's all
0.01%:  there is also
0.01%:  I'm glad that's over now
0.01%:  it's made him those
0.01%:  all I did was rem
0.01%:  wait I think he's dead so
0.01%:  I might have tried
0.01%:  it makes him the latter
0.01%:  this is a lie I'
0.02%:  this is a lie I've
0.01%:  it's kinda weird I've
0.01%:  it's me who loves
0.01%:  I don't have the degree
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also give some
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is called a
0.01%:  this is where it goes
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he said
0.01%:  this is what we do
0.01%:  it has made him a world
0.01%:  I think it's more he's made
0.01%:  it's more to
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it seems like we'd
0.01%:  while we're at it we've added
0.01%:  we don't all agree with his
0.01%:  I think we call that
0.01%:  this all makes me want
0.01%:  this new world is awesome!!
0.01%:  it's not clear he's the
0.01%:  it's like this whole song
0.01%:  it's what he's called now
0.01%:  I think we've missed a lot
0.01%:  it's when he added
0.01%:  that's wrong; he's dead
0.01%:  what I've said right now is like
0.01%:  this is more like what I'd call
0.01%:  I did not make him
0.01%:  this doesn't cover
0.01%:  he had to give
0.01%:  I word
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong that
0.01%:  I wrote this like twelve
0.01%:  I've gotten this whole
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's add some
0.01%:  it's the lesser
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it gives
0.01%:  we need to work
0.01%:  it's more like when I said
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well as the
0.01%:  we've all agreed to switch this
0.01%:  it's weird how well this song
0.01%:  that's how it's called
0.01%:  where did I leave those
0.01%:  I'm glad we worked
0.01%:  I'm glad we worked that
0.01%:  he ate
0.01%:  I don't watch
0.01%:  I've no idea what these
0.01%:  I'd love to see where this is
0.01%:  I think what we've got is
0.01%:  I think what we've got is more
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he's done
0.01%:  it's made his work sem
0.01%:  I've no idea how these
0.01%:  there's a slide
0.01%:  I'd heard he was killed
0.01%:  he never said how
0.01%:  it gets worse when we talk
0.01%:  I'll come
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like his
0.01%:  it's more like he wants
0.01%:  it's his degree that makes
0.01%:  what was his
0.01%:  while we're at it we can give
0.01%:  it's weird he named his kid
0.01%:  it's a crime that we
0.01%:  he will
0.01%:  I had no idea what
0.01%:  I'd give the second
0.01%:  it's kinda sad that
0.01%:  it's kinda sad that we
0.02%:  it's kinda sad that we've
0.01%:  it's kinda sad that we've come
0.01%:  it's kinda sad that we'll
0.01%:  it's kinda sad that we've come this
0.01%:  let's leave it there
0.01%:  I lied there and
0.01%:  I had this weird
0.01%:  it's all three
0.01%:  it seems like he's the
0.01%:  it's weird I know that
0.01%:  it's made him two things
0.01%:  it's more like a mis
0.01%:  don't tell him I said his
0.01%:  don't tell him I said his work
0.01%:  don't tell him I said his work was
0.01%:  wow that makes
0.01%:  there's a hole
0.01%:  he'll get the award even
0.01%:  when I said we
0.02%:  when I said we lived
0.01%:  it's second
0.01%:  I still don't get how this
0.01%:  this shit
0.01%:  I think it's more math
0.01%:  it's like the smart
0.01%:  that gave me weird ch
0.01%:  no there
0.09%:  no there's like
0.02%:  no there's like a
0.02%:  no there's like 
0.02%:  no there's like eight
0.02%:  no there's like twelve
0.01%:  no there's a
0.01%:  I think his ideas
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well admit we
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well admit we don
0.01%:  
0.01%:  either he's dead now
0.01%:  let's not dwell
0.01%:  he's alive and works with
0.01%:  it's more like he gave them
0.01%:  he's still alive and his work'
0.01%:  that's like how
0.01%:  I like it when he does
0.01%:  I kinda wish it had
0.01%:  all we've done with this is make
0.01%:  he's called this
0.01%:  I've got all the words
0.01%:  I'm still in the shower
0.01%:  he wants
0.01%:  I never saw his
0.01%:  it's more his dad
0.01%:  this whole time I've got
0.01%:  now that I've worked this
0.01%:  I get them
0.01%:  he's given the same
0.03%:  he's given the same credit
0.01%:  he's given the same award
0.01%:  he's given the same title
0.01%:  it's still the same sem
0.01%:  this line'
0.01%:  how the
0.01%:  it's making me sad so
0.01%:  it's making me sad so I'll
0.01%:  it's the second word that made
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well with a middle
0.01%:  it's a worse
0.01%:  it seems like I'm having
0.01%:  what I like is
0.01%:  the title was wrong
0.01%:  it's got like 
0.01%:  this means we're all doomed!!
0.01%:  this has made me tired
0.01%:  I've got the dates
0.01%:  I wish he'd get
0.01%:  when he died last
0.01%:  when he died last week
0.01%:  that's a little worse
0.01%:  I think we missed a whole
0.01%:  I don't see him listed there
0.01%:  he's still alive so don't credit me
0.01%:  we're eating
0.01%:  that's all I've got here!!
0.01%:  what's weird is it
0.01%:  I think we've missed the last word
0.01%:  I can't make the words
0.01%:  that's made his
0.01%:  that's made his work
0.01%:  it's like this where
0.01%:  I think him
0.01%:  he still had
0.01%:  now it
0.04%:  now it's called
0.01%:  now it's called the
0.01%:  now it's more
0.01%:  now it's like
0.01%:  now it's more like the
0.01%:  he's given the same award twice
0.01%:  he's a little weird and
0.01%:  it's a shame he
0.01%:  it's a shame he didn
0.01%:  it seems I
0.01%:  it seems I've made
0.01%:  he's called like
0.01%:  he's doing it
0.01%:  I don't see how we're still alive!!
0.01%:  it's more like he's a mild
0.01%:  that might take
0.01%:  I'd like to see their
0.01%:  he's dead now so he's like
0.01%:  we've also
0.01%:  we've also called
0.02%:  we've also called him
0.01%:  we've also called him the
0.01%:  it's weird that I'm doing the voice
0.01%:  that's where all
0.01%:  it makes me sad when
0.01%:  that's a lie; the word
0.01%:  that's good
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd made me
0.01%:  it's called model
0.01%:  it's more like how he's given
0.01%:  that made him a god
0.01%:  it's all I'm doing these
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's the
0.01%:  I had him listed
0.01%:  it's weird that he's dead now
0.01%:  it's kinda weird we call
0.01%:  now that I've said it he'll get mad
0.01%:  it never made him the
0.01%:  this is where we all got
0.01%:  it's like that thing
0.01%:  we have that wrong
0.01%:  I'd like that to
0.01%:  this isn't legal
0.01%:  all I did was watch the
0.01%:  all I did was watch the movie
0.01%:  the latter's kinda
0.01%:  here's a video game
0.01%:  we make that
0.01%:  wait how does this
0.01%:  i think he was
0.01%:  I think it's read
0.01%:  I've now made him that
0.01%:  his name was like
0.01%:  this makes it clear
0.01%:  we all agreed it'd
0.01%:  I think he's real dead
0.01%:  he's moved
0.01%:  wait that's weird how come
0.01%:  I think he's more sem
0.01%:  it's his sister
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what's less
0.01%:  he died last week; he'
0.01%:  I think it's there
0.01%:  I kinda made him that
0.01%:  he's dead now; this
0.01%:  he's said he doesn't care
0.01%:  it's all come down
0.01%:  what he's said
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd go
0.01%:  wow this is a
0.01%:  while we've
0.01%:  while we've got
0.01%:  these two ideas have
0.01%:  he's dead and we'
0.01%:  he's dead and we're still
0.01%:  this might've worked as
0.01%:  we can't write the
0.01%:  it's not like he's made
0.01%:  wrote a
0.01%:  wait it's like the worst
0.01%:  I hate this new world we've made!!
0.01%:  we'll give him the last two
0.02%:  we'll give him the last two words
0.01%:  I'd like to see him give his
0.01%:  what he did is less
0.01%:  this makes me wonder what it
0.01%:  this makes me wonder what it'd
0.01%:  this was a secret
0.01%:  what he's asking
0.01%:  I think that's a made
0.01%:  we don't have like
0.01%:  what'd
0.01%:  what'd he write
0.01%:  what'd he write was
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've come this
0.01%:  I think the idea was
0.01%:  wait I've made some
0.01%:  I've said the whole
0.01%:  this grew
0.01%:  that's a lie; it's making
0.01%:  I wish he'd given it
0.01%:  I wish he'd given it a more
0.01%:  I think we've got that
0.01%:  that's made me like
0.01%:  I have to get
0.01%:  it's a video game he made
0.01%:  it's kinda dated
0.01%:  we all knew he
0.01%:  it's more like he was given his
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this is the world we've all
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this is the world we've all come
0.01%:  I can't get over how well his
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which we'll
0.01%:  I still don't see
0.01%:  I still don't see how this
0.01%:  I still don't see how this makes
0.01%:  this new world is called
0.01%:  this is the dark
0.01%:  it does seem
0.01%:  it does seem like
0.01%:  I lied it's like
0.01%:  it's the end
0.01%:  that was their middle
0.01%:  we're still alive
0.01%:  that's a lie; he never liked
0.01%:  I'm making it worse with these
0.01%:  now that we've merged
0.01%:  it's weird that's the
0.01%:  I'd like to see where that goes
0.01%:  it's still the same world we'd
0.01%:  I've no idea how we
0.01%:  I've no idea how we're still
0.01%:  I've done a
0.01%:  I'm still kinda sad we
0.01%:  I've called this wrong
0.01%:  we've all since agreed the
0.01%:  while we're doing this I'll take
0.01%:  we've got it
0.01%:  we've got it all
0.01%:  it's a term he made
0.01%:  all it did was give him some sweet
0.01%:  I think we've all made this more
0.01%:  it's made him have
0.01%:  I stole the
0.01%:  it's a rh
0.01%:  I'd like to go ahead
0.01%:  I wrote a whole thesis
0.01%:  that's weird given
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well do some
0.01%:  it's more like a child who gets
0.01%:  I've added these things
0.01%:  the clever
0.01%:  give me a second while I write
0.01%:  it's more like what he did was called
0.01%:  his work also made
0.01%:  that's weird given how
0.01%:  I'd like to get a
0.01%:  it's gods
0.01%:  we've named this
0.01%:  we'd like to see
0.01%:  there's still a lot we'
0.01%:  we gave him the medal
0.01%:  we've thrown
0.01%:  what did I even write
0.01%:  we're still having a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he gets called a
0.01%:  this is all like
0.01%:  I still like how he
0.01%:  what I said were
0.01%:  he did write this
0.01%:  he's doing this
0.01%:  all I've got is this stick
0.01%:  it's wrong to call him a '
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in; I'
0.01%:  let's not talk
0.01%:  here's what we know
0.01%:  I think we'll save the
0.01%:  I lied we're still doing
0.01%:  where did I get this idea
0.01%:  I think we've lost sight
0.01%:  it's his later
0.01%:  he doesn't get called a
0.01%:  I'd like to credit him
0.01%:  I gave him the middle
0.01%:  we've done this whole
0.01%:  I don't get how we're still alive with a
0.01%:  this is all the world
0.02%:  this is all the world we'
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've all come this
0.01%:  I think we'll give that award
0.01%:  I still don't get how this makes
0.01%:  he said it was called
0.01%:  this isn't called
0.01%:  I'm more a
0.01%:  it's more like he's called a
0.01%:  it's not clear who he'd
0.01%:  I'm wrong; that
0.01%:  I'm wrong; that's the
0.01%:  he died at
0.01%:  it's weird that I can
0.01%:  I'll never look
0.01%:  I'll never look at him
0.01%:  I have no idea who else
0.01%:  he also talked
0.01%:  while I'm at it the
0.01%:  this whole time we'd
0.01%:  I wish this were made
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's hard
0.01%:  it's more like a child whose
0.01%:  this is how I see
0.01%:  I wrote the thesis
0.01%:  that seemed like it'
0.01%:  we'd still like to see
0.01%:  it's making him doctor
0.01%:  I'll admit that's where
0.01%:  this is great news
0.01%:  that's the worst case
0.01%:  it's what he wrote in
0.01%:  that's what I'll write
0.01%:  it's modern
0.01%:  I made his title
0.01%:  it's weird how he's not dead
0.01%:  it's never had
0.01%:  I can't get over how this makes
0.01%:  he'd never talked with
0.01%:  this is the most well
0.01%:  what I've said doesn't work with
0.01%:  it's making him tired
0.01%:  he did more things
0.01%:  that's like his entire
0.01%:  all I'm doing with
0.01%:  all I'm doing with this
0.01%:  I was making it all
0.01%:  that covers
0.01%:  I think we've all lost the
0.01%:  that last line made me write
0.01%:  it's the world's single
0.01%:  it's like a word
0.01%:  I legit
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also change
0.01%:  it's like the middle
0.01%:  I'll admit that's a
0.01%:  I've still got to
0.01%:  all I did was change some words like
0.01%:  it's more like what came
0.01%:  what I've said here doesn't make it
0.01%:  I might make it
0.01%:  this leads
0.01%:  we live in the world I was
0.01%:  I've got no idea what it's like;
0.01%:  I'd like to see how this ends
0.01%:  I have read
0.01%:  I've got no idea what else
0.01%:  I've got no idea what else he did
0.01%:  he's alive so I
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird how we've
0.01%:  what makes him a
0.01%:  it's all the rest
0.01%:  he's got this
0.01%:  this is how I talk
0.01%:  we're still a decade
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in to
0.01%:  his work is less
0.01%:  it's the world he lived
0.01%:  there's a sweet
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's sem
0.01%:  he came later
0.01%:  it's a legend that he wrote
0.01%:  what we're all
0.01%:  what we're all doing
0.01%:  I wrote this a week
0.01%:  it's made him a world class
0.01%:  it's that last word
0.01%:  wait that's weird how'd I
0.01%:  wait that's weird how'd I get
0.01%:  wait that's weird how'd I know
0.01%:  I think we've added
0.01%:  we think he said
0.01%:  I lied; he's called the
0.01%:  it's me who gets to call
0.02%:  it's me who gets to call him
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to move
0.01%:  wait how did we get this
0.01%:  he's alive and he likes
0.01%:  it's kinda weird we call them
0.01%:  it makes me wish we lived
0.01%:  it's more like I'd
0.01%:  wait I'm making this worse!!
0.01%:  all I know is this
0.01%:  it's not clear how well he
0.01%:  I've made the words
0.01%:  he did it with logic
0.01%:  I'll wait while
0.01%:  it's the latter I'm less
0.01%:  I might've made the last two
0.01%:  we'd like to give this
0.03%:  we'd like to give this award
0.01%:  we'd like to give this award to the
0.01%:  I'll have to go
0.01%:  wait I've got that
0.01%:  it's a little weird how the sem
0.01%:  it's that he was
0.01%:  what he did was more like design
0.01%:  it's never made him do
0.01%:  what it's done is make him go
0.01%:  there's things
0.01%:  there's things called
0.01%:  all he did was give me this sweet
0.01%:  all he did was give me this sweet nick
0.01%:  it's him who gave
0.01%:  that's how we get
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk; now
0.01%:  that's ter
0.01%:  where's he
0.01%:  I'm glad we don
0.14%:  I'm glad we don't live there
0.02%:  I'm glad we don't have
0.01%:  I'm glad we don't live here
0.01%:  I'm glad we don't live there!!
0.01%:  it's the new
0.01%:  it's his great
0.01%:  we were the
0.01%:  we were the ones who gave
0.01%:  this made things worse!!
0.01%:  this isn't the case
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad to have this
0.01%:  this isn't what we
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've made him
0.01%:  he's still alive and the work was
0.01%:  it doesn't matter who likes
0.01%:  that's all I know how
0.01%:  it's hard to tell since he
0.02%:  it's hard to tell since he's dead
0.01%:  I think we still have some
0.01%:  it'd make more sense with a
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week; we'd
0.01%:  it's clear he was the
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like a great
0.01%:  this is when we
0.01%:  we still have this
0.01%:  now that we've worked it
0.01%:  he'd get
0.01%:  I like the idea that
0.01%:  all that's wrong with it
0.01%:  I'm a little sad we
0.02%:  I'm a little sad we're living
0.01%:  we've worked this
0.01%:  we've worked this into
0.01%:  there's a song with
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've made the
0.01%:  this doesn't read
0.02%:  this doesn't read well
0.01%:  this doesn't read like
0.01%:  that song was
0.01%:  wait a second there's like eight
0.01%:  when he died it
0.01%:  that's weird; I'
0.01%:  it's a little weird when I talk
0.01%:  it's made him great
0.01%:  there's a second sem
0.01%:  worked
0.01%:  I get tired
0.01%:  it was on
0.01%:  this is a thing we
0.01%:  this is a thing we'
0.01%:  this is a thing we've
0.01%:  I think we've made that last
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well eat some
0.01%:  that's kinda how I'm
0.01%:  let's give him a new
0.01%:  he's still alive and might come
0.01%:  he makes the
0.01%:  I can't get over how well these
0.01%:  that's the cr
0.01%:  what's it like to live with
0.01%:  that's all I've got; there
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we'd call the
0.01%:  what I did there was making
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's more like we
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well admit I
0.01%:  he still likes the word
0.01%:  it's the whole word
0.01%:  I don't see how these
0.01%:  I can write
0.01%:  we mess
0.01%:  he's still alive so he gets to decide!!
0.01%:  I'd still give him
0.02%:  I'd still give him the award
0.02%:  I'd still give him the credit
0.01%:  I'll give him that credit
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how I'm still
0.01%:  we can't give him a
0.01%:  we're all kinda glad he'
0.01%:  now it's the
0.01%:  that's a nice rh
0.01%:  this seems like a lot
0.01%:  that's now how
0.01%:  it's more like his ideas
0.01%:  I'd like to see how he
0.01%:  I stole his
0.01%:  it's good he
0.01%:  I might've made all these
0.01%:  it's heres
0.01%:  we did it
0.01%:  that's still where I
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well re
0.01%:  he asked the wrong
0.01%:  I'll show it
0.01%:  which was
0.01%:  it's also a
0.01%:  we never called him that!!
0.01%:  let's go watch
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's weird to make
0.01%:  his work is now
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well that goes
0.01%:  that gives me idea
0.01%:  I'll give him the latter
0.01%:  he's since dis
0.01%:  I don't have his degree listed
0.01%:  it's this song called
0.01%:  it's added
0.01%:  we don't have time to read this
0.01%:  I think there's some cave
0.01%:  this needs more
0.01%:  it's the clever
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that I've come this
0.01%:  it's a little weird when he talks
0.01%:  we don't like the
0.01%:  he's still alive we
0.01%:  it's the world we don
0.01%:  this is where I'd make
0.01%:  I'd like to see where that last
0.01%:  it's clear he's not
0.01%:  no it was called
0.01%:  it's more like he'll have
0.01%:  all I've done is read his
0.01%:  I think he's more '
0.01%:  I don't see what's so clever
0.01%:  all he did was design some
0.01%:  all he did was design some clever
0.01%:  words can
0.01%:  he's not great
0.01%:  he's not great with
0.01%:  it's made him write
0.01%:  I am having
0.01%:  what it did was set
0.01%:  there's still that
0.01%:  it's called the world's most wanted
0.01%:  I'm glad we're done with this so
0.01%:  this isn't a good idea
0.01%:  I'd like to watch this
0.01%:  I'd like to watch this movie
0.01%:  I think it's time we had
0.01%:  it's when he tried
0.01%:  it's made him the world's single
0.01%:  it's like the most weird
0.01%:  that's wrong; he called
0.01%:  I have little
0.01%:  his work was a little less
0.01%:  this is what I've called
0.01%:  I've read it like twice and
0.01%:  no idea what'
0.01%:  it'd make him the god
0.01%:  it's kinda what he's most
0.01%:  I've got this whole series
0.01%:  I think it's headed
0.01%:  I'll give him the second award
0.01%:  I heard it's called the
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I've ended
0.01%:  that's how we've
0.01%:  that's how we've come
0.01%:  he was doing more
0.01%:  he was doing more with
0.01%:  I've come to the
0.01%:  his name's '
0.01%:  it's that word
0.01%:  he solved a
0.01%:  that's kinda weird with
0.01%:  he needs
0.01%:  it's me who gets all the credit now
0.01%:  it's said more
0.01%:  let's not give credit
0.01%:  this whole time I wanted
0.01%:  it's a lower
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's make it
0.01%:  he did it while eating
0.01%:  while we're at it I've also added the
0.01%:  now that we've added
0.01%:  I had to make the
0.01%:  given that
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well am
0.01%:  wait it's the same
0.01%:  I've read the sem
0.01%:  I've still got this
0.01%:  I made him a thing
0.01%:  it's more like 'the
0.01%:  it's the movie
0.01%:  while we're having
0.01%:  I don't get what the
0.01%:  I made that weird
0.01%:  I don't get how either
0.01%:  I made that while
0.01%:  and
0.01%:  I've read like 
0.01%:  that's the least clever
0.01%:  what I've got here is called
0.01%:  we think it's his
0.01%:  I wrote this last week and
0.01%:  we don't call them like
0.01%:  it's more like when the
0.01%:  it's the same work
0.01%:  that doesn't seem right;
0.01%:  it's all I've read on
0.01%:  it's more like the dead
0.01%:  while I'm doing it
0.01%:  I have no idea what we
0.01%:  I seem to have lost
0.01%:  all I know is there's a movie
0.01%:  it's all these words I
0.02%:  it's all these words I'm making
0.01%:  it's all these words I've
0.01%:  it's all these words I've made
0.01%:  that showed
0.01%:  it was this sem
0.01%:  it's a whole thing called
0.01%:  he's still alive so we get
0.01%:  we've still got a lot
0.01%:  these two things were said
0.01%:  I think there's video
0.01%:  I think there's video games called
0.01%:  that's what gives
0.01%:  I don't like math
0.01%:  we're having him
0.01%:  that's the world we live in I'
0.01%: ; it's made
0.02%: ; it's made him the
0.01%:  I had that wrong
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we'd like to switch
0.01%:  I think he saved
0.01%:  there's a living
0.01%:  come with
0.01%:  come with me right
0.01%:  it's hard to see how we'd even
0.01%:  wait I've messed it all
0.01%:  let's stick with sem
0.01%:  that makes me scared
0.01%:  he was the world
0.01%:  I think we have time
0.01%:  these words have made
0.01%:  I might've said too
0.01%:  I think the real sem
0.01%:  I've got the tim
0.01%:  I kinda made all this
0.01%:  I wrote this in a
0.01%:  it's kinda how he gets
0.01%:  it's kinda how he gets called
0.01%:  I'm wrong; he was
0.01%:  I made him a doctor
0.01%:  wait where did I even
0.04%:  wait where did I even get this
0.01%:  it was a review
0.01%:  we killed
0.01%:  I will take
0.01%:  all I've got here is a link
0.01%:  all I've done is mis
0.01%:  this doesn't work with all
0.01%:  the works
0.01%:  while we're at it let's divide
0.01%:  I made these last two things
0.01%:  all I did was change three
0.01%:  I think there's a divide
0.01%:  it's made him that; I'
0.01%:  that's wrong; he was like
0.01%:  I might've done this
0.01%:  I admit it'
0.01%:  while I'm not
0.01%:  it's him that
0.01%:  there's like a song called
0.01%:  now I've said it so
0.01%:  it's like the worst song I have
0.01%:  I think it's said
0.01%:  it's more like he's among
0.01%:  asked
0.01%:  I'd like to give him the credit and
0.01%:  wait I get
0.01%:  what's weird is that I seem
0.01%:  this is making me sad I
0.01%:  that's where I'm moving
0.01%:  it's more like he's solved the
0.01%:  there's a whole song we
0.01%:  let's take this down
0.01%:  that's all wrong; I'
0.01%:  that's all wrong; I've
0.01%:  now I'd like some
0.01%:  he's still alive and it's 
0.01%:  he's like the least
0.01%:  that's what we called it
0.01%:  he likes h
0.01%:  he's dead and it's more
0.02%:  he's dead and it's more like
0.01%:  he's dead and it's more like he
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd done
0.01%:  he's still alive so he can
0.01%:  no he's still dead
0.01%:  he's still alive and dead
0.01%:  he's dead now; his work
0.01%:  this makes me cr
0.01%:  he's dead so it's more like we
0.01%:  that's all I've got in the
0.01%:  I don't see the
0.01%:  no I made it
0.01%:  it's more like middle
0.01%:  it's more like middle child
0.01%:  I throw
0.01%:  we can't agree
0.01%:  it's weird to call him a
0.01%:  it's a crime what I've done to this
0.01%:  I might've said the
0.01%:  that's all the words I've come
0.01%:  it's making him weird
0.01%:  he was still alive when I
0.01%:  that is the wrong
0.01%:  it gave me the
0.01%:  these were all lies
0.01%:  it's more like he was the sem
0.01%:  I'd have said
0.01%:  he claims he was
0.01%:  he did his sem
0.01%:  I'd like some more
0.01%:  now that we've said the words we'll
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree that it
0.01%:  it's still hard to solve these
0.01%:  it's still work
0.01%:  we've no
0.02%:  we've no idea what
0.01%:  we've no idea where
0.01%:  I think we're all glad
0.01%:  I wish we were still asking the
0.01%:  it's a term with
0.01%:  I lie this
0.01%:  right now he lives
0.01%:  that's all I did with
0.01%:  all he did was write down those
0.01%:  I've made him the last
0.01%:  it's this girl
0.01%:  it's this girl named
0.01%:  he's still alive; it's weird how
0.01%:  wait where did he
0.01%:  it's weird that he's also
0.01%:  it's nice that
0.01%:  it's nice that we
0.01%:  it's nice that we'
0.01%:  it's nice that we've
0.01%:  it's nice that we're all
0.01%:  he died two weeks ago and
0.01%:  this is kinda sad
0.01%:  this is where it comes
0.01%:  there's still so
0.01%:  I'd rank
0.01%:  what I've done here is mis
0.01%:  it's a video game he's worked
0.01%:  he might've missed
0.01%:  that's a whole new
0.01%:  it's given him some sweet
0.01%:  it's given him some sweet awards
0.01%:  that was never
0.01%:  that led
0.01%:  I've got some real
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work I give
0.01%:  I heard it's like cheese
0.01%:  I can't resist
0.01%:  that's taking
0.01%:  it's his work that's one
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also give a
0.01%:  he kinda h
0.01%:  it never goes
0.01%:  I will take this
0.01%:  where did I get that line
0.01%:  the last line made him
0.01%:  there was a mis
0.01%:  there's also like this
0.01%:  I've no idea what the world is
0.01%:  it's headed
0.01%:  we don't call that
0.01%:  I've made him into that
0.01%:  there's like a solid
0.01%:  it's the third most
0.01%:  the world we live in made him
0.01%:  I have that wrong
0.01%:  I don't see how we screw
0.01%:  it's more like what I've done
0.01%:  I think there's a video game called '
0.01%:  it's kinda weird what

0.01%:  I think he did get
0.01%:  I kinda get the
0.01%:  I think we've gotta
0.01%:  I looked this all
0.01%:  he was given a

0.01%:  I'd like to see the world we'd have
0.01%:  I might not have made
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what was

0.01%:  he's still alive and I did
0.01%:  I'm gross
0.01%:  he gets all the credit!!
0.01%:  it's like his middle name or

0.01%:  it's like a great
0.01%:  the second is where
0.01%:  that's like their middle
0.01%:  wait when
0.01%:  we still think he was
0.01%:  this has led
0.01%:  what are the odds we'd get
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this was the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this was the world
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this was the world we'
0.01%:  his middle name was like

0.01%:  I've had the window
0.01%:  I've had the window closed
0.01%:  it's more how he came
0.01%:  that doesn't work with a
0.01%:  I was wrong; he's the
0.01%:  we call him either
0.01%:  the world's second
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm doing
0.01%:  there's like this giant
0.01%:  we don't call him the '
0.01%:  it's the second more
0.01%:  that's like the worst sem
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that's where
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that's where we live
0.01%:  I know the word
0.01%:  that's all we're doing this week at
0.01%:  it's more the sem
0.01%:  there's a wide
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he was
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that we
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that we're still
0.01%:  that was me right
0.01%:  I'm glad we sorted
0.01%:  I lied; he's still dead
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's not
0.02%:  it's a little weird how he's not dead
0.01%:  that's all his work'
0.01%:  this might make a nice
0.01%:  that's like the worst cl
0.01%:  seems like he's more
0.01%:  I might've messed those last
0.01%:  I've read the thing
0.01%:  I've read the thing twice
0.01%:  I've read the thing like
0.03%:  I've read the thing like twice
0.01%:  it's him in
0.03%:  it's him in the middle
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's got a
0.01%:  we've had that song
0.01%:  it has given rise
0.01%:  it's like that song
0.01%:  it's like that song where
0.01%:  I think he's a little weird
0.01%:  he's a lot older
0.01%:  now I've said his
0.01%:  we still have to decide who gets
0.01%:  all I did was tweak the words
0.01%:  this is the cool
0.01%:  he's dead and he
0.01%:  it's like a second
0.01%:  I have like eight
0.01%:  that's dread
0.01%:  we call these the
0.01%:  I've messed with his
0.01%:  all he did was cook
0.01%:  he doesn't make him
0.01%:  I have no idea how we'd write
0.01%:  we'll need a
0.01%:  don't give
0.05%:  don't give him credit
0.02%:  don't give him the
0.06%:  don't give him the award
0.03%:  don't give him the credit
0.01%:  that's like worse
0.01%:  let's get him a new
0.01%:  this made it worse!!
0.01%:  it's not clear how well he'
0.01%:  it's not clear how well he's aged
0.01%:  that leaves
0.01%:  we did it wrong
0.01%:  that made me wish
0.01%:  that made me wish I'd never
0.01%:  I think it's so weird
0.01%:  we have to call them
0.01%:  it's how he gets
0.01%:  he's right on
0.01%:  the world we live in is what'
0.01%:  it's like these two
0.01%:  it made him those
0.01%:  this song's weird
0.01%:  I think what's called
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd solved all
0.02%:  it's making me wish we'd solved all these
0.01%:  ever since he was
0.01%:  I kinda get where this
0.01%:  that's when it
0.01%:  that's a lie; he liked
0.01%:  that's making him twice
0.01%:  this makes me wish we'd all
0.01%:  I still don't like how
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like where we
0.01%:  we've all gotta
0.01%:  this is all he
0.01%:  this is all he's ever
0.01%:  this is all he's ever talked
0.01%:  it's weird how he's got
0.01%:  this all seems kind
0.01%:  I think it's still hard
0.01%:  this seems like a weird thing to call
0.01%:  he never did make
0.01%:  I've now said this
0.03%:  I've now said this twice
0.01%:  it's a lie; he never
0.01%:  we had to remove his
0.01%:  what I'm having
0.01%:  I never said it was good
0.01%:  it's hard to talk while we
0.01%:  we might need a
0.01%:  it's not clear he's liked
0.01%:  we like to call them
0.01%:  he's kinda great
0.01%:  he's still alive and might write
0.01%:  I heard he died last
0.01%:  I've got like a whole thesis
0.01%:  it's the world he made
0.01%:  that's a little weird when viewed
0.01%:  it was he who gave me
0.01%:  we've all agreed it'd
0.01%:  it's the more well
0.01%:  that's how it was
0.01%:  he gets all the credit and we've
0.01%:  this is making me wish I wrote
0.01%:  since he was
0.01%:  it'll get
0.01%:  what he did was make it so we
0.01%:  we're making it all
0.01%:  when I said it
0.05%:  when I said it was the world
1.18%:  when I said it was the world we lived
0.01%:  when I said it was the world we'
0.01%:  we'll have to strike
0.01%:  all this time
0.01%:  I don't agree with his views at
0.01%:  it's a miss
0.01%:  it ended there
0.01%:  I don't like how this verse
0.01%:  this isn't legal advice
0.01%:  he's listed second
0.01%:  change
0.01%:  the word I wanted was 'g
0.01%:  what he did was list some
0.01%:  wait I think his
0.01%:  while we're at it I've also come
0.01%:  we've all agreed with the
0.01%:  don't tell him I made
0.01%:  his great
0.01%:  it gave him the same
0.01%:  there's like at
0.01%:  he's alive and wrote
0.01%:  what's worse is that I'
0.01%:  what's worse is that I've
0.01%:  that makes him dead
0.01%:  all I've done is mess
0.02%:  all I've done is mess with
0.01%:  all I've done is mess with the words
0.01%:  all I've done is mess with the word
0.01%:  we can't write this
0.01%:  there's this little
0.01%:  he wrote that down
0.01%:  he's dead; it
0.01%:  it's more like he laid
0.01%:  we don't give awards called
0.01%:  it seems I have
0.01%:  it's what it's called over
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's kinda
0.01%:  it's all there's time
0.01%:  what I think we've got
0.01%:  I made him the latter
0.01%:  it's more like he was close
0.01%:  this is making me love
0.01%:  it does make me wonder
0.01%:  it does make me wonder which
0.01%:  it does make me wonder what
0.01%:  what I'd like right now is some advice
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he made
0.01%:  the latter's a lie
0.01%:  I think what we call
0.01%:  that's a little weird now
0.01%:  I've said this all
0.01%:  it's called semi
0.01%:  where did I get this last
0.01%:  wait I need
0.01%:  it's more like he might've said
0.01%:  I like the other
0.01%:  it's more that he got
0.01%:  we all know it's the other
0.01%:  we call that kind
0.01%:  I think we've got his middle
0.01%:  I'd like to change his
0.04%:  I'd like to change his middle
0.01%:  I think we all agree it's his
0.01%:  I think the doctor
0.01%:  that's a sweet nick
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd gone with
0.01%:  I wish he'd said
0.01%:  that does seem
0.01%:  that does seem like
0.01%:  that does seem weird
0.01%:  it's more like he added this
0.01%:  it's not clear who'd
0.01%:  it's normal
0.01%:  we do have the
0.01%:  I think he's more a middle
0.01%:  he's got some weird
0.01%:  he'd never said he
0.02%:  he'd never said he likes
0.01%:  he'd never said he liked it
0.01%:  I kinda wish he was still
0.01%:  it's more like he did the sem
0.01%:  he gave the idea
0.01%:  I'ma need
0.01%:  it's hard to tell with some
0.01%:  this is making me sad so
0.02%:  this is making me sad so I'll
0.01%:  I think it's worth 
0.01%:  this was like the weird
0.01%:  it was his degree
0.01%:  we've made him that too
0.01%:  this whole time I've liked
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how math gets
0.01%:  it's like how he
0.01%:  I think all he
0.20%:  I think all he did was give
0.17%:  I think all he did was write
0.11%:  I think all he did was come
0.07%:  I think all he did was write some
0.03%:  I think all he did was give some
0.02%:  I think all he did was solve
0.01%:  I think all he did was give a
0.01%:  I think all he did was give me
0.01%:  I think all he did was write some code
0.01%:  I think all he did was get
0.01%:  I think all he did was give it some
0.01%:  I think all he did was derive
0.01%:  we've all read this
0.01%:  he's also made
0.01%:  wait how did I even
0.02%:  wait how did I even get here
0.01%:  I might've sort
0.01%:  it's so clear
0.01%:  now that we've said it I'd
0.01%:  wait he's still living
0.01%:  he's still alive as
0.01%:  he said the words
0.01%:  what it did was made
0.01%:  he's like third
0.01%:  I've waited
0.01%:  this is all I'm taking
0.01%:  it's all he's doing
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as it'd seem
0.01%:  those last two lines were me
0.01%:  his work hasn
0.01%:  I've made him the world's oldest
0.01%:  we'd still like to hear his
0.01%:  we'd still like to hear his views
0.01%:  he was a kid when
0.01%:  this was like the most
0.01%:  we miss
0.01%:  he died last winter
0.01%:  this whole time I was like
0.01%:  all I did here was give
0.01%:  it's that he's worked
0.01%:  I lied he was never
0.01%:  it's more like the same
0.01%:  now that we've said it like
0.01%:  I think he was scared
0.01%:  what he did was like come
0.01%:  it's what it's like
0.01%:  it's what it's like when
0.01%:  the world is a
0.01%:  I've come to think
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's still the
0.01%:  where did I get the idea
0.01%:  what's weird is that we don't call
0.01%:  what I did there was take two
0.01%:  it's me who wrote the last
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he gets to
0.01%:  I'm making it worse the
0.01%:  it's still the same work
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad the whole world is
0.01%:  that's less well
0.01%:  what we've got here is some
0.01%:  I'm making this as
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's go
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's go with
0.01%:  I'm sing
0.01%:  I'm a little ash
0.01%:  this isn't the weird
0.01%:  I don't see him there
0.01%:  I think we'll give this
0.01%:  I think we'll write
0.01%:  there's a video game in
0.01%:  there's a twelve
0.01%:  his name was right
0.01%:  I think the idea'
0.01%:  I also like
0.01%:  I've made a slight
0.01%:  that's kinda racist h
0.01%:  I'll have to make
0.01%:  this is what I'd write
0.01%:  what I did there was to
0.01%:  what I'm doing is like
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well work
0.01%:  it's not well
0.01%:  can we still
0.01%:  it's so weird that I'm making this
0.01%:  he's more like what
0.01%:  I think we've made all the
0.01%:  it's a video game that
0.01%:  we're all good
0.01%:  we're all good with
0.01%:  we're all good with this
0.01%:  there's a legal
0.01%:  those are the two
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who likes
0.01%:  mine is the
0.01%:  that's kinda how I'd write
0.01%:  I gotta
0.01%:  it'll never get
0.01%:  he gave a talk with
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I made the
0.01%:  he'd like to
0.01%:  ever since I was
0.01%:  it's more like he won
0.01%:  he's more like the middle son
0.01%:  I've no idea what this word
0.01%:  it's a crime that he
0.01%:  he's dead; his work
0.01%:  I was wrong it's like
0.01%:  I was wrong it's like the
0.01%:  it's a shame he died
0.01%:  what he did was create some
0.01%:  I'd change that
0.01%:  that's what it said
0.01%:  it was him who gave it
0.01%:  I wish it were the
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he'd care
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he solved
0.01%:  I'd like to credit him with
0.01%:  I've heard he's kind
0.01%:  it's more what he did to
0.01%:  there's no limit
0.01%:  that was a trick
0.01%:  that's less weird with
0.01%:  I think we did that
0.01%:  it's kinda a shame
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he gets called '
0.01%:  this gave me the weird
0.01%:  this means we've got
0.01%:  it's the middle school
0.01%:  this is a weird met
0.01%:  while it's great that we
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's how
0.01%:  I asked him to write this down
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he's the
0.01%:  it makes him so
0.01%:  we're also still
0.01%:  he did it with some
0.01%:  no it's made
0.02%:  no it's made him the
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd make
0.01%:  his work did that
0.01%:  he won't talk
0.01%:  he's served
0.01%:  he's still alive and did the
0.08%:  he's still alive and did the work
0.01%:  it's clear this whole
0.01%:  all I did was write down these
0.01%:  I'll have to re
0.01%:  wow that came
0.01%:  he's still alive in
0.01%:  the kids call me
0.01%:  now that we've clar
0.01%:  it's hard to take him
0.01%:  I'm a doctor
0.01%:  I don't care what he's like;
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's a
0.01%:  it's me who asked
0.01%:  it's me who asked him
0.01%:  I think we all agree his
0.01%:  it also made him the 
0.01%:  don't give him the award;
0.01%:  he did like it
0.01%:  he also did work in
0.01%:  he was in the
0.04%:  he was in the middle
0.01%:  we're adding that
0.01%:  what he did was write like
0.01%:  as I've
0.01%:  that last line came
0.01%:  now that I've heard it like
0.01%:  we're still making the
0.01%:  we've short
0.01%:  wait we're making
0.02%:  wait we're making this
0.01%:  there's video games called that
0.01%:  he did write some
0.01%:  he gave me this nick
0.01%:  he's a logic
0.01%:  there's this old
0.01%:  there's also two
0.01%:  it's more like has
0.01%:  we'd love to hear what
0.01%:  I'd like to see the world'
0.01%:  I think we've agreed this
0.01%:  I'd kill to hear
0.01%:  what I did was re
0.01%:  wow this makes
0.01%:  this is like the second most
0.01%:  he was asked to review this
0.01%:  this is where we've gone
0.01%:  when he said it
0.01%:  wait he's a
0.01%:  I said he'
0.01%:  it seems he did
0.01%:  what was I even
0.01%:  I think we might've all missed
0.01%:  it's still in
0.01%:  we're still doing that
0.01%:  this makes me want to go
0.01%:  that made me c
0.01%:  all I did there was mess
0.01%:  we called it that
0.01%:  what I did there was make two
0.01%:  I can't tell what's weird
0.01%:  all these words came
0.01%:  it's more like he did the same
0.01%:  he's had like twelve
0.01%:  look
0.01%:  let's agree to call
0.01%:  let's agree to call him

0.01%:  the name's a
0.01%:  the name's a little
0.05%:  the name's a little weird
0.01%:  I see him
0.01%:  he's a middle
0.01%:  he's a middle child
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well invest
0.01%:  that's gr
0.01%:  it's made him like this
0.01%:  I think he did it more
0.01%:  that one is
0.01%:  all I did was give him some
0.01%:  all I did was give him some credit
0.01%:  there's a video game like
0.01%:  there's a video game like this
0.01%:  there's a video game like this called

0.01%:  while we're at it let's watch some
0.01%:  while we're at it let's watch some videos
0.01%:  it's word
0.01%:  now that I've made the
0.01%:  it's made him decide
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we moved
0.01%:  this is making it worse;
0.01%:  that's dis
0.01%:  I've got the dates screw
0.01%:  I think what we've all
0.01%:  I think what we've all agreed

0.01%:  I'm glad that's over with!!
0.01%:  it's not clear how we'll make
0.01%:  it's a lie; he's never
0.01%:  this isn't where we
0.01%:  this will make things worse
0.01%:  what I'm doing is weird
0.01%:  it's kinda made him that
0.01%:  he's alive and we'
0.01%:  he's alive and we're still
0.01%:  we'd like him to come
0.01%:  he'd given
0.01%:  this all might make
0.01%:  we have like 
0.01%:  I think he is more well
0.01%:  he's given talks called
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we've had a
0.01%:  that's what gave
0.01%:  it's called some other thing I
0.01%:  it's called some other thing I'
0.01%:  while we're at it he's made
0.01%:  all he did was give me his
0.01%:  I had to re
0.01%:  it's the whole latter
0.01%:  that's still where I live
0.01%:  it's like the third most sem
0.01%:  that's his new
0.01%:  that's his new middle
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; come
0.01%:  it's all cooked
0.01%:  it's the world we'd have
0.01%:  it did make him the latter
0.01%:  he died a long
0.01%:  that's the worst sem
0.01%:  I've lied a
0.01%:  I've lied a little there
0.01%:  ask
0.01%:  wait a sec I've
0.01%:  wait a sec I've got this
0.01%:  I've got all kinds
0.01%:  this makes me real
0.01%:  I don't have that
0.01%:  I kinda made the last
0.01%:  he's making me write
0.01%:  it's not like he ever said
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's also
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that his
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that his middle
0.01%:  I'm making the whole world
0.01%:  I was sort
0.01%:  that was me who wrote it!!
0.01%:  it's kinda got
0.01%:  isn't he more
0.01%:  isn't he more like
0.01%:  it's more like mid
0.01%:  I might have to ask
0.01%:  what I said was more
0.01%:  I think it's the same word twice
0.01%:  I'd call it a
0.01%:  don't call
0.01%:  I think it's a movie
0.01%:  don't ask me what the
0.01%:  that's where I'm making
0.01%:  I've had it wrong all
0.01%:  I've had it wrong all this time;
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's not
0.01%:  it's weird we
0.01%:  he died this week so I'
0.01%:  he might've wanted
0.01%:  it's the award
0.01%:  I might've like
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's well
0.01%:  that was '
0.01%:  when it was
0.01%:  this has made me write down
0.01%:  what he did made
0.01%:  I have this wrong
0.01%:  I've no idea how his sem
0.01%:  I waited
0.01%:  wait that's where
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well that came
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how little
0.01%:  he won't ever
0.01%:  when I read this it makes
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that I've made him
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I'm acting
0.01%:  I think it made his
0.01%:  it makes him that second
0.01%:  this will make me the
0.01%:  it's so old
0.01%:  that's what I'd write
0.01%:  I think we give
0.01%:  I think we give him
0.02%:  I think we give him credit
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to show
0.01%:  it's this whole new
0.01%:  I don't see what we've got
0.01%:  while that's wrong
0.01%:  it's called what now
0.01%:  this cre
0.01%:  I've no idea how this will
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's not how
0.01%:  the world is now
0.01%:  I've no idea what it's like there
0.01%:  it's more like we've had this
0.01%:  we don't like it
0.01%:  he did ask
0.01%:  I'm dead
0.01%:  I'm dead tired
0.01%:  it made him what's now
0.01%:  we ended
0.01%:  it doesn't give him the
0.01%:  it doesn't give him the credit
0.01%:  I was wrong the
0.01%:  that's when we
0.01%:  at the time he was called
0.01%:  he said he doesn
0.07%:  he said he doesn't like it
0.04%:  he said he doesn't like gr
0.01%:  he said he doesn't care
0.01%:  he said he doesn't like it!!
0.01%:  it's more like he's a dad who gets
0.01%:  I can't see him with
0.01%:  it's that weird thing
0.01%:  that did not go as well as I'd like
0.01%:  what I've said here is most
0.01%:  what it did was give him ten
0.01%:  it's served
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in a week ago;
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in a week ago; I'
0.01%:  he's the worst
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what we've lost
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's like
0.01%:  since it's a
0.01%:  he has like two
0.01%:  we're still asking him that
0.01%:  he's still alive right now so
0.01%:  he'd made it
0.01%:  we think he solved
0.01%:  I made the whole sem
0.01%:  doesn't he have
0.03%:  doesn't he have like
0.01%:  we gave him his nick
0.01%:  wait I take
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've all got
0.01%:  it's kinda what he's most well
0.01%:  strike the
0.01%:  it's a real thing he'
0.01%:  I credit
0.01%:  it's like that's what
0.01%:  I lied; this was
0.01%:  he's two
0.01%:  it's more like a child that
0.01%:  it's hard to even make
0.01%:  I'd like to see this world
0.01%:  it's now called '
0.01%:  I like this so
0.01%:  this seems like a weird thing to do
0.01%:  that's kinda weird so I'll
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've con
0.01%:  I think he missed some words
0.01%:  it's more how he's viewed
0.01%:  even I'm tired
0.01%:  what's weird is that I'm not
0.01%:  I got the word
0.01%:  we need like
0.01%:  it'll make him dead
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's still time
0.01%:  I don't read this
0.01%:  we still need him alive
0.01%:  that seems like the weird
0.01%:  that's all we've got there
0.01%:  where I
0.01%:  I can't read this well
0.01%:  I don't get how he's made
0.01%:  it's hard to tell since we
0.01%:  that's a lie it
0.01%:  I've heard he's not
0.01%:  I'd still like to give
0.01%:  all we have
0.01%:  no it's like a
0.01%:  I tried to make this
0.01%:  this degree
0.01%:  this is most
0.01%:  d
0.01%:  we don't give awards like
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week so I might
0.01%:  now that I've listed
0.01%:  I heard him called
0.01%:  we still don't have a clear
0.01%:  it's how he earned
0.01%:  what I've said doesn't work well
0.01%:  what I've said doesn't work well with
0.01%:  what's weird is that I don
0.03%:  what's weird is that I don't like
0.01%:  I liked it more when he
0.02%:  I liked it more when he was called
0.01%:  I think we've all read it
0.01%:  these two ideas were
0.01%:  it's still a thing where we'
0.01%:  he gave it to his
0.01%:  I like it when we
0.01%:  that'll have
0.01%:  it's the second word I've
0.01%:  it's the second word I've made
0.01%:  it's more with
0.01%:  his kids named the
0.01%:  we were k
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's kinda weird I
0.01%:  it's him more
0.01%:  it's tragic how little
0.01%:  his name is '
0.01%:  what it's done is give him awards
0.01%:  it's like where he was
0.01%:  isn't the
0.01%:  we've all agreed that I
0.01%:  I think he's old
0.01%:  he's still alive; go
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we'd give
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we like
0.01%:  all he did was write some sem
0.01%:  we live in the same world that
0.01%:  we live in the same world that we'
0.01%:  we live in the same world that we'd
0.01%:  I'm still asking him
0.01%:  I think he'd die
0.01%:  I never did like that
0.01%:  it made him a god
0.01%:  it's him second
0.01%:  he's still alive I didn
0.01%:  it's hard to do
0.01%:  this had
0.01%:  I gave him that title
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that these
0.01%:  that's what got
0.01%:  all I know is that he's a
0.01%:  I like his sem
0.01%:  now I've read the
0.01%:  it's me who's the real
0.01%:  all I've read is that
0.01%:  all I did was write the whole
0.01%:  we'll give it to him later
0.01%:  I lied there; he was
0.01%:  the word I wanted is
0.01%:  I might've made those last lines
0.01%:  it's less like that
0.01%:  the two are dis
0.01%:  that's not real
0.01%:  I've worked this into
0.01%:  it's clear I
0.01%:  we're taking his
0.01%:  it's more like he'd given
0.01%:  it's the video
0.02%:  it's the video game where
0.01%:  it's the video game series
0.01%:  it's the video game called
0.01%:  I think that's gr
0.01%:  no wait I've screw
0.01%:  this means we're still
0.01%:  I'd like to clear things
0.01%:  his name's called
0.01%:  we still like him even
0.01%:  he'd never said that
0.01%:  what he called it was '
0.01%:  it still has made
0.01%:  I'd rate him as
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've made this
0.01%:  no idea what I
0.01%:  it's more like he c
0.01%:  I liked his name
0.01%:  I'm doing a dis
0.01%:  that's a weird one
0.01%:  I was asked to write this down
0.01%:  I think he's worse
0.01%:  I wrote this so
0.01%:  what we've got here is an
0.01%:  it's this math
0.01%:  there's this video game we'
0.01%:  it's this one over
0.01%:  it's the other one!!
0.01%:  no wait he's like the
0.01%:  the second has
0.01%:  I think there's some disc
0.01%:  what it made him were
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in a week ago; I'
0.01%:  it has made him less
0.01%:  it doesn't make him this;
0.01%:  it's the rest
0.01%:  it's me who's making all
0.01%:  it's me who's making all this
0.01%:  the third line was
0.01%:  it seems like he's still
0.01%:  what I've said is more like
0.01%:  that's weird now that I'
0.01%:  that's weird now that I'm
0.01%:  it's the world we live in is
0.01%:  I wrote that second
0.01%:  I made the whole word
0.01%:  what he's done is make me
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd have
0.01%:  it's what made him decide
0.01%:  I don't like cheese
0.01%:  he's still alive and might write me
0.01%:  all he did was give them
0.01%:  his middle name is the word '
0.01%:  it's more him doing
0.01%:  I'm still the
0.01%:  he's like the main
0.01%:  I made that last rh
0.01%:  he's died like three times and
0.01%:  it's what we call it when we write
0.01%:  there's like two names
0.01%:  it's got some
0.01%:  I'm making this whole series
0.01%:  I'm wrong; his
0.01%:  I was r
0.01%:  that's like the worst I've done
0.01%:  it's cooked with
0.01%:  I kinda agree
0.05%:  I kinda agree with him
0.02%:  I kinda agree with the
0.01%:  I kinda agree with his
0.01%:  I kinda agree with this
0.01%:  he's still alive at the
0.01%:  I might've looked
0.01%:  I'm losing the
0.01%:  he never did this
0.01%:  he drew a
0.01%:  it all gets
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's still
0.01%:  I think all he did was derive some
0.01%:  it's more like a g
0.01%:  it was his mom'
0.01%:  we've agreed to call his
0.01%:  it's more like I made it
0.01%:  he's given it
0.01%:  that's a little weird how we
0.01%:  that's a lie!! I
0.01%:  I think what we were
0.01%:  it ends
0.01%:  it ends with
0.01%:  I liked the whole
0.01%:  he doesn't like how we
0.01%:  it seems I've said
0.01%:  he's never liked the
0.01%:  it's more like things have
0.01%:  this is all new
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd make this
0.01%:  it's like when he was
0.01%:  he's still alive and asked
0.01%:  I still don't see what
0.01%:  I still don't see what'
0.01%:  I think we'll cover
0.01%:  I think we'll cover this
0.01%:  it's named with the
0.01%:  now that I've said it there's like a
0.01%:  that's what's great
0.01%:  this now
0.01%:  this now makes
0.01%:  this now makes him
0.01%:  I'd watch this
0.01%:  I'm sorta making this whole
0.01%:  he's still alive so I might want
0.01%:  that's all we've said
0.01%:  what was his middle
0.01%:  all we've done with the
0.01%:  it's more like a wh
0.01%:  I was doing the
0.01%:  I think that's screw
0.01%:  I'd like to see where it
0.01%:  it's the world we wish we lived in; I
0.01%:  while we're at it I think we've all got
0.01%:  he's real mad
0.01%:  his work was done well
0.01%:  what he did was great
0.01%:  it seems like he solved
0.01%:  it's more like he loves
0.01%:  it's a mat
0.01%:  that's all I've got him
0.01%:  it's more like what I was
0.01%:  it's more like it was
0.01%:  wait it's more like the
0.01%:  this is all wrong; he
0.01%:  these are like two
0.01%:  he doesn't like all
0.01%:  I've missed the whole
0.01%:  we've agreed that the
0.01%:  I'd still eat
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last time I was
0.01%:  it's not clear whose
0.01%:  this is the world we've kinda
0.01%:  that's a lie; it's the
0.01%:  he's still alive and was right
0.01%:  he did work in the
0.01%:  that's evil
0.01%:  that's more like a thesis
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's a weird
0.01%:  it's more like d
0.01%:  it's weird how that's come
0.01%:  it doesn't make it
0.01%:  it doesn't make it rh
0.01%:  I'm glad that's over with since
0.01%:  he's still alive; it was
0.01%:  now it's more like his
0.01%:  he's worked in a
0.01%:  we got the whole
0.01%:  I think it's a term
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he's a
0.01%:  the latter was his
0.01%:  the latter was his nick
0.01%:  it's making me write this
0.01%:  those last words
0.01%:  he got the award in '
0.01%:  what's weird is that I've come
0.01%:  I kinda made those
0.01%:  how does he
0.01%:  there's like a class
0.01%:  all I've done is throw
0.01%:  we'd like him to write
0.01%:  wait that didn
0.01%:  he's more like his dad
0.01%:  he's still living; he wrote
0.01%:  it's like over
0.01%:  now that I've said it here
0.01%:  it's the middle line
0.01%:  this is the worst name
0.01%:  I did get
0.01%:  he's doing the
0.01%:  wait I think we've all
0.01%:  it's the worst idea I've had all week so
0.01%:  who is this
0.01%:  I've got no idea what he was like
0.01%:  all I did was change two
0.01%:  since we've all
0.01%:  since we've all agreed
0.01%:  this is not where
0.01%:  we still have that
0.01%:  what it's done is make him decide
0.01%:  we might as well switch
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm making it
0.01%:  those two things are like
0.01%:  wait he died last
0.01%:  wait he died last week
0.01%:  I have no idea where we
0.01%:  wait I think we screw
0.01%:  it doesn't make the
0.01%:  no there's like a whole
0.01%:  it's like his second most well
0.01%:  I think we might've come
0.01%:  when it comes to this
0.01%:  I've said this all wrong;
0.01%:  wait I think we've got this
0.01%:  I lied; he never said
0.01%:  he's never said he likes it!!
0.01%:  I asked him to change
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever settle
0.01%:  same
0.01%:  this might've all worked
0.01%:  it doesn't make him those
0.01%:  I lied he wrote
0.01%:  it seems like he never
0.01%:  I'm making it worse with this
0.01%:  it's kinda great he
0.01%:  while we're doing it
0.01%:  it was her
0.01%:  I've made it a
0.01%:  I've called him other
0.01%:  I write this song
0.01%:  it's like a whole song
0.01%:  it's a whole other
0.01%:  he'd more
0.01%:  he made more
0.01%:  I've read it like twice now
0.01%:  it's real sad
0.01%:  no that's weird I
0.01%:  no that's weird I'
0.01%:  what we call it is the
0.01%:  what we're still
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he's made
0.01%:  it's made him the oldest
0.01%:  we call him that in
0.01%:  now that we've made this world
0.01%:  I've named this
0.01%:  I think that made me
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what we did
0.01%:  it's some kind
0.01%:  I think we've called
0.01%:  it's like that second
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm having
0.01%:  it's made him the wrong
0.01%:  he doesn't like the term
0.01%:  I have no idea where it's come
0.01%:  it's more like he's a long
0.01%:  I'd still take him
0.01%:  while that's a
0.01%:  I wish we lived in that world!!
0.01%:  all I did there was move
0.01%:  that's kinda dis
0.01%:  I think we have to credit
0.01%:  I think we added
0.01%:  it's still kinda hard to solve
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd called that
0.01%:  even I'm like
0.01%:  he gets his nick
0.01%:  what he does
0.01%:  what he does is write
0.01%:  he gets it
0.01%:  all that is
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's making it
0.01%:  it's hard to get this
0.01%:  it's ended
0.01%:  all I know is there's a video
0.01%:  all I know is there's a video game with
0.01%:  it's where it gets
0.01%:  there's no disc
0.01%:  it's the word game
0.01%:  it's like ten
0.01%:  it's like ten words
0.01%:  I've now come
0.01%:  the word in the title was
0.01%:  this reads like I
0.01%:  wait I like
0.01%:  it's weird now
0.02%:  it's weird now that I've
0.01%:  he's like a real
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've got all
0.01%:  that's a hor
0.01%:  he also gave
0.01%:  it's what I'm doing this
0.02%:  it's what I'm doing this week
0.01%:  it's more like I've made this
0.01%:  I added the last two lines while rec
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd have time
0.01%:  we're all doomed!!
0.01%:  we all agree that's not
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd ever get this
0.01%:  I wrote this song like 
0.01%:  that isn't where
0.01%:  me
0.01%:  it's when he was like
0.01%:  this isn't as
0.01%:  it's what he likes
0.01%:  I know it's weird that
0.01%:  wait I don't have time
0.01%:  that's like words
0.01%:  it's more like I'm a
0.01%:  we've made little
0.01%:  I'm still making the
0.01%:  it's making him well
0.01%:  it's a dish where
0.01%:  his title was '
0.01%:  he never asks
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I'm a
0.01%:  I think we're still the same
0.01%:  he had to wait
0.01%:  all that did
0.04%:  all that did was give
0.04%:  all that did was give me the
0.03%:  all that did was give him
0.01%:  all that did was give me some
0.01%:  all that did was give me this
0.01%:  all that did was give me more
0.01%:  all that did was give me this weird
0.01%:  all that did was remind
0.02%:  all that did was remind me how
0.01%:  all that did was give me ch
0.01%:  I think it's clear we have
0.01%:  what's making
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's not the
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's come
0.01%:  he's still dead alive
0.01%:  I'm scared to ask
0.01%:  all I did was change '
0.01%:  it's all we ever talked
0.01%:  I think we've tried
0.01%:  I've read that like
0.02%:  I've read that like twice
0.01%:  what it's done is get him a sweet
0.01%:  I wrote the last line while
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who I
0.01%:  I think that's closer
0.01%:  this is all he wrote
0.01%:  what it's made him is get called
0.01%:  we call those things
0.01%:  I think it's made him less
0.01%:  I've no idea how this came
0.01%:  we're asking the
0.01%:  I dig
0.01%:  this makes me sad to
0.01%:  this makes me sad to write
0.01%:  it's the more like
0.01%:  that gets me
0.01%:  don't give him a
0.01%:  he's dead now so it's weird I
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this little time
0.01%:  it's a whole class
0.01%:  wait that's not how
0.01%:  I think it gave him some credit
0.01%:  it's more like he was 
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how we've come
0.01%:  what I've read
0.01%:  there's a movie made
0.01%:  what he calls
0.01%:  what he did was take some
0.01%:  that's awesome!!
0.01%:  that's all we've heard
0.01%:  he likes it a
0.01%:  he's still cool
0.01%:  I added all those
0.01%:  that's all we're doing this week is
0.01%:  no the
0.01%:  wait no this
0.01%:  we screw
0.01%:  there's like a twelve second
0.01%:  we call those the
0.01%:  I think we all get
0.01%:  there was that
0.01%:  it's more like a co
0.01%:  this means I
0.01%:  this means I'm
0.01%:  this means I've wasted
0.01%:  this means I've wasted like
0.01%:  this whole time we've missed
0.01%:  might want
0.01%:  it's clear what
0.01%:  he doesn't read
0.01%:  that's all we've got;
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in a week ago;
0.01%:  give him a call
0.01%:  it gets worse!!
0.01%:  I think he's less well
0.01%:  I wrote this song like twelve
0.01%:  I'm sick right
0.01%:  I'm sick right now so this
0.01%:  it's me and
0.01%:  I think we might've read
0.01%:  I'd give this
0.01%:  I'd heard it as
0.01%:  I've said this a
0.01%:  he's still active and
0.01%:  this made it worse;
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week so I'm a
0.01%:  I'd like to share
0.01%:  I'd like to share with
0.01%:  this has made it worse
0.01%:  wait I don't get
0.01%:  he's still alive I don't get
0.01%:  we're losing this
0.01%:  I'ma write
0.01%:  I'ma write this
0.01%:  it made him what is
0.01%:  it made him what is called
0.01%:  while we're on it
0.01%:  while we're at it he's also got
0.01%:  I'll talk
0.01%:  it was like the world
0.02%:  it was like the world's most
0.01%:  it was like the world's second
0.01%:  what he did was write down some well
0.01%:  it gave him a whole
0.01%:  now that I've said it it makes me wish
0.01%:  I made the math
0.01%:  we don't give him a title
0.01%:  I'd like to see him give this
0.01%:  I think that's word
0.01%:  it's worth asking what
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like the world I was
0.01%:  what he did wasn
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in; I'
0.01%:  I've got no idea what is
0.01%:  we still can't solve this
0.01%:  I think '
0.01%:  it's called these
0.01%:  there's a good case
0.01%:  what I've done is create
0.01%:  the older
0.01%:  all I've done here is take the
0.01%:  I'd get
0.01%:  it's making that
0.01%:  what's making me
0.01%:  it made him that even
0.01%:  it's me that
0.01%:  it's me that's made
0.01%:  it's where he asked
0.01%:  his work is not
0.01%:  I've heard it was
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he got
0.01%:  it makes him called
0.01%:  while we're at it I'll give him
0.01%:  it's like the worst video
0.01%:  it's like the worst video game I
0.01%:  it's all worked
0.01%:  what I've said right now makes it
0.01%:  it's a link
0.01%:  it all makes
0.01%:  I'd also
0.02%:  I'd also like to give
0.07%:  I'd also like to give credit
0.01%:  what I've said isn
0.02%:  what I've said isn't right
0.01%:  I'm still kinda glad he
0.01%:  it's more like he was given some
0.01%:  I made the tim
0.01%:  I'll give him some
0.03%:  I'll give him some credit and
0.01%:  I lied; he wrote his
0.01%:  I've said this wrong like a
0.01%:  he's still alive; weird
0.01%:  that's w
0.01%:  that's wicked
0.01%:  that's wicked awesome
0.01%:  that's wack
0.01%:  that's wicked wrong
0.01%:  I'm wrong the
0.01%:  I've listed him twice here
0.01%:  it's weird that he's called one
0.01%:  it's weird we call
0.01%:  he's still alive and writes code
0.01%:  I've now read
0.01%:  wait he never did
0.01%:  it's more like he's mild
0.01%:  I still think we've
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad there's a limit
0.01%:  it's weird how he was
0.01%:  I can't get over the idea
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that's the
0.01%:  I've got the word
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's less
0.01%:  this is the worst ac
0.01%:  what I said is the
0.01%:  that one's like
0.01%:  it's more like he's close
0.01%:  he's alive right now so
0.01%:  we're still in the middle ages
0.01%:  I can't take
0.01%:  while we're at it I've got to
0.01%:  it was the hard
0.01%:  I think we might've added some
0.01%:  these sem
0.01%:  let's all agree this was
0.01%:  what I did there is kind
0.01%:  it was his second
0.01%:  he died last week so it's hard
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don
0.07%:  we've all agreed we don't like
0.09%:  we've all agreed we don't like this
0.04%:  we've all agreed we don't like the
0.02%:  we've all agreed we don't like his
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don't like it
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don't like this tim
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don't like him
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don't like those
0.01%:  we've all agreed we don't talk
0.01%:  we gave him that name
0.01%:  that's like seven
0.02%:  that's like seven words
0.01%:  his name is more
0.01%:  wait I lied he
0.01%:  wait I lied he's the
0.01%:  it's more like that whole
0.01%:  it's made his work the
0.01%:  we might as well write
0.01%:  what I did was remove
0.01%:  it does seem kinda
0.01%:  it does seem kinda weird
0.01%:  that's making me weird
0.01%:  it's more like he's made a lot
0.01%:  we call them mat
0.01%:  he's still alive and I'm right
0.01%:  I've made the whole world
0.01%:  he died this week; I
0.01%:  I might have like added
0.01%:  all this is making me sort
0.01%:  all I know right
0.01%:  he can't write
0.01%:  all that is wrong
0.01%:  it's worth twelve
0.01%:  how did we get on the
0.01%:  it's this one where
0.01%:  it's weird how that's like
0.01%:  what we're still doing
0.01%:  this is how it goes
0.01%:  I have no idea what degree
0.01%:  I think it's also
0.01%:  that's the kind
0.01%:  how hard
0.01%:  I think there's a missed
0.01%:  this is what I've secret
0.01%:  it's more like called the
0.01%:  that's more what
0.01%:  I think the awards
0.01%:  what it's done is made him get older
0.01%:  wow I never
0.01%:  this doesn't work well with time
0.01%:  this is what made me
0.01%:  some have
0.01%:  I wrote these with
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in; we
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in; we'
0.01%:  the video game called
0.01%:  all I did there was switch two
0.01%:  it's more like he's dead and I
0.01%:  call him
0.01%:  I wrote this this
0.01%:  that makes the world
0.01%:  that makes the world we
0.01%:  that makes the world we lived
0.01%:  it did make him that; I'
0.01%:  wait I've mis
0.01%:  all I've done is rem
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week; I came
0.01%:  I made those last two rh
0.01%:  I'll go home
0.01%:  I'll go home and write
0.01%:  I'll go home and write this
0.01%:  we call these kind
0.01%:  I think it's all the
0.01%:  it's a little che
0.01%:  it's more like he's active
0.01%:  I've lost it there
0.01%:  it's more that he added
0.01%:  the world we live in had
0.01%:  we call those kinds
0.01%:  he made his work
0.01%:  I still need to write
0.01%:  it's all the math
0.01%:  his dad was the
0.01%:  that last line makes me wish
0.01%:  that last line makes me wish I'd died
0.01%:  there's a ton
0.01%:  it's weird we call him
0.01%:  I had the words
0.01%:  we're all doing him
0.01%:  there's a whole middle
0.01%:  he's still the same
0.01%:  this doesn't make his
0.01%:  I think it's a little weird how we
0.01%:  I think it's a little weird how we've
0.01%:  I think it's a little weird how we've made
0.01%:  all he did was give the name
0.01%:  he's more like a son
0.01%:  I've heard he liked it
0.01%:  I can't make these
0.01%:  I can't make these words
0.01%:  I think he moved
0.01%:  we all agree this was
0.01%:  we still have some time
0.01%:  we'll settle
0.01%:  it's not clear how we'd get
0.01%:  it's not clear how we'd get him
0.01%:  I'd have called it the
0.01%:  this is making me sad!! I
0.01%:  I might've made the doctor
0.01%:  all he did was sit
0.01%:  this is all I've got in
0.01%:  this is all I've got in terms
0.01%:  it's more like what I'm doing is
0.01%:  I've seen it
0.01%:  I don't get how the
0.01%:  what I did here was make
0.01%:  did I make
0.01%:  it's more like he saved
0.01%:  there's like a slight
0.01%:  it's all the world'
0.01%:  we don't care what he did
0.01%:  wait how did I get this
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd write
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd write this
0.01%:  we all agree it's his
0.01%:  he's still alive and he's awesome!!
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who's a
0.01%:  it makes me wish I were
0.01%:  I'm in love with his work
0.01%:  his work doesn't deal
0.01%:  it was his work that
0.01%:  I've made that second
0.01%:  the latter is how
0.01%:  it's a swear
0.01%:  I liked this idea more
0.01%:  all we know is he wrote
0.01%:  I'd like to have his
0.01%:  I'm wrong; that was
0.01%:  I'd still like to see him get
0.01%:  I tried making it
0.01%:  it's hit
0.01%:  things worked
0.01%:  he's never asked me to
0.01%:  it's not clear who was
0.01%:  we all know who's the real
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he gets
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how he gets called
0.01%:  I'm high
0.01%:  I lied and made him
0.01%:  I lied; that's his
0.01%:  I like this new world we've made with
0.01%:  I've still got like a decade
0.01%:  it's more that he was making
0.01%:  that's what makes me
0.01%:  it's still the whole
0.01%:  that was me; I wrote
0.01%:  we all agree that he
0.01%:  that's dead
0.01%:  we'll give the award to his
0.01%:  I'd like to see more
0.01%:  the reason we
0.01%:  the reason we call
0.01%:  the reason we'
0.01%:  we've all since agreed that we'
0.01%:  we still need to solve
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd also like to get
0.01%:  when did I write
0.01%:  that's how we ended
0.01%:  this is still a
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he gave
0.01%:  what it's done is make the world'
0.01%:  I think this is awesome
0.01%:  I've wanted
0.01%:  I've wanted to write
0.01%:  all I did was change words like
0.01%:  it's making me wish I was a
0.01%:  we can't do this
0.01%:  I wrote that the
0.01%:  wait I lied there
0.01%:  wait I lied there's like
0.01%:  what I did there was disc
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it will
0.01%:  I wish he'd talked
0.01%:  I wish he'd talked more
0.01%:  I've said it like
0.01%:  as I recall it
0.01%:  as I recall it'
0.01%:  I have no idea what we'll
0.01%:  what he did was write down lots
0.01%:  we did this whole
0.01%:  I know that's weird
0.01%:  I think there's a case
0.01%:  that's a lie; he's called
0.01%:  he's never said that
0.01%:  it's more like he claims
0.01%:  this does seem like the
0.02%:  this does seem like the world
0.02%:  this does seem like the world we'
0.02%:  this does seem like the world we live in!!
0.01%:  this does seem like the world we'd
0.01%:  this does seem like the world we've
0.01%:  I'll change the
0.01%:  he's like an
0.01%:  I think it's clear the
0.01%:  it's more like he was the middle
0.01%:  I've no idea how we'll
0.01%:  we're having these
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I have
0.01%:  it's not that clever
0.01%:  he was most
0.01%:  all it's done is give me the world
0.01%:  I think we'll have to decide
0.01%:  I'd change the last word
0.01%:  we still have his
0.01%:  we call these d
0.01%:  it's more like hash
0.01%:  it is still
0.01%:  I will admit right
0.01%:  I'd like to see this show
0.01%:  he's hiding
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever get the
0.01%:  we might as well remove
0.01%:  the second most
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd settle
0.01%:  I can't tell what's more awesome
0.01%:  it made him other
0.01%:  I think he lied
0.01%:  what I did was take his
0.01%:  while we're at it we need
0.01%:  I lied there was like
0.01%:  I'd like to see where this goes;
0.01%:  wait what's wrong with me I'm sick
0.01%:  when was
0.01%:  we've tried asking
0.01%:  we've tried asking him
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what I love
0.01%:  wait what is wrong with me I've lost
0.01%:  it is the second
0.01%:  I can't write these
0.01%:  the second's more
0.01%:  we've had the term
0.01%:  we've had the term since
0.01%:  it was more like when he was twelve
0.01%:  I can't get over how sweet
0.01%:  it's more like it's made his
0.01%:  we've had it since the
0.01%:  we call that whole
0.01%:  he gets all the credit in
0.01%:  this is like the single
0.01%:  all I've done is make the world
0.01%:  I'll read the
0.01%:  he's in there
0.04%:  he's in there twice
0.01%:  we can't tell who's more
0.01%:  I'd never made this
0.01%:  this isn't what we'
0.01%:  this was the review
0.01%:  it's a weird met
0.01%:  this is the world we live in I
0.01%:  this is the world we live in I'
0.01%:  that does make me wonder
0.01%:  we've all agreed that this is kind
0.01%:  it's the worst sem
0.01%:  it's like the world has
0.01%:  his work is all
0.01%:  adding
0.01%:  what I did was change
0.01%:  the whole time I was mis
0.01%:  this was the real
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad that
0.01%:  since he's dead it's more like he
0.01%:  it's me who's asking
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to give some
0.01%:  it's still like the hard
0.01%:  I write this song while
0.01%:  that's how I like
0.01%:  it's more like he solved an
0.01%:  that cre
0.01%:  the math gets weird
0.01%:  he's still alive; there's a
0.01%:  he kinda gets called
0.01%:  while we're at it can I
0.01%:  while we're at it can I get some
0.01%:  we'll take
0.01%:  I don't recall his sem
0.01%:  I've come down with a head
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what's given
0.01%:  it's a little weird he was
0.01%:  he doesn't like how I said
0.01%:  that was a review
0.01%:  this makes more sense with
0.01%:  there's like a whole disc
0.01%:  I think we've missed his middle
0.01%:  we've made the whole
0.01%:  that's some sick
0.01%:  I've got no idea where he was
0.01%:  it's me who gets all the credit; I've
0.01%:  I made the last verse
0.01%:  he's got two
0.01%:  he did all his work in
0.01%:  it's this song I wrote while
0.01%:  this seemed like a good time
0.01%:  leave
0.01%:  it's more like the dad who leaves
0.01%:  he's still weird
0.01%:  all I know is he's great
0.01%:  I wish he was more
0.01%:  we don't call them the
0.01%:  I've made his sem
0.01%:  wow this whole
0.01%:  it's what got me
0.01%:  that's his middle name; I
0.01%:  he died last week; we
0.01%:  he died last week; we're still
0.01%:  there's laws
0.01%:  it's still some
0.01%:  what's weird is I don't like
0.01%:  that seemed like a good rh
0.01%:  I'm making those two
0.01%:  it's weird that he'd
0.01%:  we all agree it's not
0.01%:  it was like a whole
0.01%:  it's more that he's still
0.01%:  it's more like I've added the
0.01%:  it's like the worst name I
0.01%:  we messed with
0.01%:  we messed with his
0.01%:  it's what his sem
0.01%:  the last thing was
0.01%:  he's still making more
0.01%:  while we're at it let's let
0.01%:  we all agree that's his middle
0.01%:  he made me write this song
0.01%:  wow I think this
0.01%:  what it's done is give me the worst
0.01%:  I'm still kinda the
0.01%:  we had to remove his middle
0.01%:  I'm making that third
0.01%:  I'll let him have
0.01%:  what I'm asking is this
0.01%:  all he did was write down the time
0.01%:  we can get
0.01%:  there it is
0.01%:  I called him a
0.01%:  all I did was write some things
0.01%:  it doesn't take
0.01%:  it's more like a dad with
0.01%:  the second word is a
0.01%:  I think it's two
0.01%:  he's still adding
0.01%:  we might have to take
0.01%:  all those words make
0.01%:  I think we called them
0.01%:  it's making him the worst
0.01%:  go
0.01%:  it's more like a thing he was
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's still
0.01%:  I've no idea who did
0.01%:  this is less clever
0.01%:  it's the world we almost
0.01%:  I think all we
0.01%:  I think all we're
0.01%:  it gets kinda
0.01%:  it gets kinda weird
0.01%:  we can't give him the last
0.01%:  it's what it's called there
0.01%:  that seems like weird
0.01%:  we're still making him
0.01%:  I lied there at
0.01%:  that was two
0.01%:  we don't read
0.01%:  we don't read his
0.01%:  it's hella racist
0.01%:  in this world we have
0.01%:  I think there's some claims
0.01%:  it makes him a grand
0.01%:  I'm making this title
0.01%:  that's wrong; he's made
0.01%:  this doesn't work at all;
0.01%:  that's like the most clever
0.01%:  it's more like he's made it so we
0.01%:  I got those
0.01%:  it seems like that
0.01%:  he'd never get
0.01%:  it's more like he was well
0.01%:  he's hard
0.01%:  that's wrong; I made
0.01%:  give me a second while I work
0.01%:  give me a second while I work this
0.01%:  this is like the worst name
0.01%:  it's more like he's a dad with some
0.01%:  it's his math work
0.01%:  we're doing this as
0.01%:  it's kinda over
0.01%:  this made me sad while
0.01%:  this made me sad while I wrote
0.01%:  I've made him the second word
0.01%:  I'm glad there's a
0.01%:  we gave him his own
0.01%:  I'm in the shower
0.01%:  that's the worst m
0.01%:  I never said it'
0.01%:  it does seem kinda weird that
0.01%:  we've got that all
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this is where we've come to as
0.01%:  it was like the most
0.01%:  he's making more
0.01%:  I wrote this in case we
0.01%:  it still makes him that even
0.01%:  that's where I've come
0.01%:  it's me who gets the credit;
0.01%:  this is a cr
0.01%:  this is how we get
0.01%:  it's how he likes
0.01%:  I'd like to change the world'
0.01%:  it's clear we've got
0.01%:  it's not clear he likes it
0.01%:  I did it right
0.01%:  that's some great
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad to live
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he was
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong that's like
0.01%:  what did he come
0.01%:  what I'd like is the world
0.01%:  it doesn't work with sc
0.01%:  it's their sem
0.01%:  it's kinda what he does
0.01%:  the whole world's kind
0.01%:  it's called thesis
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed these
0.01%:  I might've made all these words
0.01%:  I'll do
0.01%:  it doesn't work at
0.01%:  I'd like to see a movie where
0.01%:  that's too
0.01%:  the words I said
0.01%:  we've all agreed that is
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we'd call
0.01%:  he did write that second
0.01%:  we had it
0.02%:  we had it wrong
0.01%:  it's weird how we got
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's still
0.01%:  I'm making this whole idea
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it's worth
0.01%:  we're like two
0.01%:  wait this isn
0.01%:  wait this isn't right
0.01%:  I'd heard it was like
0.01%:  it's this video game called '
0.01%:  he's a dad
0.01%:  it's like what he said
0.01%:  what I'm most
0.01%:  I liked the song
0.01%:  I think his dad'
0.01%:  that makes even
0.01%:  its more
0.01%:  while we're at it let's get him some
0.01%:  I think there'll
0.01%:  I'd go with the last
0.01%:  there's video games in it
0.01%:  I think that's over
0.01%:  he doesn't like it as
0.01%:  it's a little odd
0.01%:  it's all sem
0.01%:  I've got no idea what it's called either
0.01%:  I'll never watch
0.01%:  I don't have their
0.01%:  he was there like
0.01%: ; the
0.01%:  it still gets
0.01%:  what I've said might make
0.01%:  it's more like when he'
0.01%:  I have no idea who made
0.01%:  it's weird how the last
0.01%:  he'll take credit
0.01%:  we're taking a
0.01%:  I think he said more
0.01%:  the world is awesome
0.01%:  I don't get how that
0.01%:  he's nice
0.01%:  I can't see how he
0.01%:  I write all the
0.01%:  while we're at it let's not
0.01%:  there's this kind
0.01%:  I'm glad this is all
0.01%:  he's more like a dad who'
0.01%:  we'll give him the last credit
0.01%:  the world is still the same as
0.01%:  I like how it reads
0.01%:  wait I think we've all missed
0.01%:  there's a lot we have
0.01%:  it's what we call him in
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in so we'
0.01%:  I might've messed his
0.01%:  it's weird that he's even
0.01%:  it's weird that he's even called
0.01%:  it's the reason I've
0.01%:  in this world he's dead
0.01%:  there's like a thing called a
0.01%:  no I did
0.01%:  that's kinda cor
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how we'
0.01%:  it's the world I'
0.01%:  it's the world I've
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well note
0.01%:  I'd still like to have him
0.01%:  I'm worse
0.01%:  I'm worse at this
0.01%:  I wrote it with the
0.01%:  it's like the second time he was
0.01%:  we've all died
0.01%:  wait let me change
0.01%:  he wrote it twice
0.01%:  now that I've said it makes
0.01%:  I've no idea how well that
0.01%:  he's still alive there
0.01%:  it'd make him the second
0.01%:  I still think the
0.01%:  here's a little advice
0.01%:  this verse is a
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's kinda weird
0.01%:  there's still some things
0.01%:  he's still alive; I'm kinda
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in some weeks
0.01%:  we'll give him the nick
0.01%:  that's dish
0.01%:  while we're at it I've got a whole
0.01%:  I don't care what he does
0.01%:  I think he wrote some
0.01%:  I said it wrong the
0.01%:  I kinda wrote it
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we've had
0.01%:  he's still alive so I'm screw
0.01%:  he died this week and I'm still
0.01%:  it's a little weird how those
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added that
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's now
0.01%:  that's weird; I've
0.01%:  I think it's still more
0.01%:  it's hard to know what I
0.02%:  it's hard to know what I've
0.01%:  it's hard to know what I've said
0.01%:  it's more like he's the dad in
0.01%:  it's weird that I knew
0.01%:  he's the co
0.01%:  this is where I get lost
0.01%:  I like this more
0.01%:  it's a third
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how we
0.01%:  he's the sole
0.01%:  I'm adding the words
0.01%:  I'm glad we don't live there;
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's get rid
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is less
0.01%: ; it's more like he's the god
0.01%:  what's weird is that we've talked
0.01%:  he's a dead
0.02%:  he's a dead white
0.01%:  I hate this new world!!
0.01%:  wait that's wrong he's still dead
0.01%:  he's more akin
0.01%:  what's weird is it's called
0.01%:  what's weird is it's called the
0.01%:  don't ask me how he
0.01%:  let's give him his
0.01%:  let's give him his own award
0.01%:  I've said this like three times and
0.01%:  we'll have to ignore
0.01%:  I kinda wish he's
0.01%:  while we've got him
0.01%:  wait where'd I get the last line
0.01%:  it's a little weird when the
0.01%:  there's like twelve things I'
0.01%:  wait a second I'm like
0.01%:  wait that's weird I've
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what we've made
0.01%:  he's more like the dad I
0.01%:  the worst thing
0.01%:  this seems like it'd go
0.01%:  this seems like it'd go over
0.01%:  it was like called
0.01%:  the latter makes him a
0.01%:  I think there's so
0.01%:  let's have him
0.01%:  I'm having the same
0.01%:  I think we'd agree
0.01%:  I think we'd agree that'
0.01%:  wait I've made it
0.01%:  wait I've made it worse
0.01%:  I lied there's a
0.01%:  we'd call him that
0.01%:  it's more like what he called
0.01%:  now it's more like he
0.03%:  now it's more like he's the
0.01%:  now it's more like he's a
0.01%:  now it's more like he's the dad
0.01%:  it's the other '
0.01%:  it's so weird that we
0.01%:  I'm glad we worked this all
0.01%:  that was the review
0.01%:  all I did was think
0.01%:  it's me who's done the
0.01%:  these are the last
0.01%:  we've still got time
0.01%:  it's all these other
0.01%:  it's said the other
0.01%:  that's like the 
0.01%:  I made the thesis
0.01%:  it's more like he was mild
0.01%:  there's a dead
0.01%:  it's like he wrote the
0.01%:  I did not write the
0.01%:  it's making him a little sad
0.01%:  this is news
0.01%:  I have now
0.01%:  I think he's dead so it's weird we
0.01%:  I think he's dead so it's weird we call
0.01%:  he died last week in
0.01%:  it's more like he holds
0.01%:  I don't like the idea
0.01%:  he's more like the dad in
0.01%:  it's a song I
0.01%:  it's a song I wrote while
0.01%:  it's a song I made
0.01%:  there's a nice video
0.01%:  I don't like how this reads
0.01%:  we've done this twice
0.01%:  it claims
0.01%:  there's a kid who
0.01%:  I think we call this
0.01%:  these last three
0.01%:  now that I've said this we
0.01%:  now that I've said this we'
0.01%:  he's got this weird
0.01%:  all I know is he's old
0.01%:  what I've said there is called
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he called
0.01%:  I wrote this when we lived
0.01%:  given his
0.01%:  this seems like a cr
0.01%:  it's here that I'
0.02%:  it's here that I'd like to give
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's move
0.01%:  he's a d
0.01%:  it's him there
0.01%:  we'll give that last
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm taking the
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd get this
0.01%:  that's a lie; there's like 
0.01%:  it's hard to disc
0.01%:  I wish he was still
0.01%:  that doesn't work at all!!
0.01%:  what's he like
0.01%:  he won't get
0.01%:  he won't get credit
0.01%:  that makes me wish we'd solved
0.01%:  I wrote this while mess
0.01%:  I asked him to write me
0.01%:  it doesn't matter how he
0.05%:  it doesn't matter how he's viewed
0.01%:  it's called the world we
0.01%:  it's kinda metal
0.01%:  it's making him a dead
0.01%:  I think the movie
0.01%:  I think the movie was
0.04%:  I think the movie was called
0.01%:  I think the movie'
0.10%:  I think the movie's called
0.01%:  there's a video game named
0.01%:  he has given
0.01%:  it's made him decide that
0.01%:  I can't write it
0.01%:  this is the second time I'm
0.01%:  that was a thing
0.01%:  we have to get this
0.01%:  the name came
0.01%:  we'd still like him
0.01%:  we'd still like him to answer
0.01%:  that was the world we'
0.01%:  that was the world we'd lived
0.01%:  I'd like to leave the
0.01%:  that name is weird
0.01%:  the world we live in is that I'm sick
0.01%:  wait he never talked
0.01%:  it was me who made it
0.01%:  it was more like he'
0.01%:  it was more like he's
0.01%:  what's weird is the second
0.01%:  it's weird that I even
0.01%:  no I wrote
0.01%:  it's weird how math
0.01%:  this is the second sem
0.01%:  that's c
0.01%:  that's cringe
0.01%:  I don't see what's so great with
0.01%:  what it's made him is over
0.01%:  I'll let him decide how
0.01%:  I've asked
0.01%:  I'm kinda high
0.01%:  that's all he's doing
0.01%:  I think he more did
0.01%:  it's like the cover
0.01%:  I'd like to watch some
0.01%:  it's worth making the
0.01%:  it's cr
0.01%:  the world is like
0.01%:  I think he'll get it
0.01%:  this isn't the world we'll
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to see
0.01%:  it's more like n
0.01%:  this makes the most
0.01%:  it's what got him into
0.01%:  what I've said since the
0.01%:  we think that's a
0.01%:  I'll stick with what
0.01%:  I think we all secret
0.01%:  it's more what his
0.01%:  this makes me wish it
0.01%:  no wait that's like the weird
0.01%:  he's doing his
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd called it
0.01%:  I think that's awesome
0.01%:  it was the other sem
0.01%:  there's like a whole dis
0.01%:  he's making some
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how we've
0.01%:  it makes him that in
0.01%:  he's still alive and he comes
0.01%:  while I'm at it might as well ask
0.01%:  I'm doing this like
0.01%:  I think we've made it worse with
0.01%:  I've got no idea what the real
0.01%:  what it's done is made his
0.01%:  what it's done is made his work
0.01%:  he doesn't have kids called
0.01%:  that made it worse when
0.01%:  I like him more when
0.01%:  I'd like him to solve
0.01%:  I can't see what
0.01%:  I've got all the credit
0.01%:  that's more like what we'
0.01%:  it's lower
0.01%:  I'm doing this over the
0.01%:  that's a lie; it's making him
0.01%:  this never gets called
0.01%:  now I've said it like
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird that
0.01%:  he's still alive; he doesn
0.02%:  he's still alive; he doesn't get
0.03%:  he's still alive; he doesn't get credit
0.01%:  he's still alive; he doesn't care
0.01%:  he's still alive; he doesn't get dead
0.01%:  that's there
0.01%:  I wish he'd gotten
0.01%:  I messed with the words a
0.01%:  he'll never get that
0.01%:  it doesn't have this
0.01%:  I've gotten this all
0.01%:  he called it the word
0.01%:  it made him work
0.01%:  I've kinda messed the
0.02%:  I've kinda messed the whole
0.01%:  he's still alive so there goes
0.01%:  no that makes
0.01%:  I'd like to win
0.01%:  he's still dead!!
0.01%:  it's still clear
0.01%:  it's not what
0.01%:  he doesn't like me
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little we've made him
0.01%:  I've messed that whole
0.01%:  it's more like he's living
0.01%:  what it's said
0.01%:  it's now his
0.01%:  it's now his middle
0.01%:  what I said were the
0.01%:  gods
0.01%:  gods don't like
0.01%:  he's said that
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it's his sem
0.01%:  what I'm doing is this
0.01%:  it's more like he's the cave
0.01%:  I like this change
0.01%:  we've made him the second
0.01%:  he's still alive; he got it
0.01%:  I think he's got some weird
0.01%:  it's more that he's got
0.01%:  I'm glad he never
0.01%:  while we're at it I like
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd said
0.01%:  when he looked
0.01%:  all these are
0.01%:  I think we have to write
0.01%:  as I recall he
0.01%:  we won't get
0.01%:  all that did was remind me I
0.01%:  all that did was remind me I'
0.01%:  the world we live in might make
0.01%:  it's more in the middle
0.01%:  the world we live in was this
0.01%:  that looks
0.01%:  this is what I came
0.01%:  it's making him all
0.01%:  I'd like to have him write
0.01%:  what's worse is that we
0.01%:  he's worth like
0.01%:  what I did there isn
0.01%:  what I did there isn't called
0.01%:  he doesn't write the
0.01%:  all I've done is write these
0.01%:  I lied and threw
0.01%:  he's still alive; he gets credit
0.01%:  that's the second time I've walked
0.01%:  I'd like to call the
0.01%:  I might've messed it all
0.01%:  we have a word
0.01%:  we're taking this whole
0.01%:  he might've also worked in
0.01%:  we're all like that
0.01%:  I've read that like twice now
0.01%:  he's dead so it's all
0.01%:  it's more this whole
0.01%:  now that I've made it
0.01%:  he has never
0.01%:  the time
0.01%:  it's a r
0.01%:  I made the whole world
0.01%:  what I'd like to see is where
0.01%:  I kinda wish he did
0.01%:  he's still alive and I'm the
0.01%:  I think it's racism
0.01%:  all I know is we've
0.01%:  he's making his
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which I said
0.01%:  when he died I
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time; I'd
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time; I'd like
0.01%:  I've made it right
0.01%:  all we know is he died
0.01%:  we've got a little
0.01%:  he's still alive; the word
0.01%:  it's a hat
0.02%:  it's a hat trick
0.01%:  I like it either
0.01%:  I wrote that while we lived
0.01%:  cooked
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to also
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to also give
0.01%:  wait where did he get
0.01%:  that made me cringe so
0.01%:  wait how did we get here I'm still
0.01%:  he doesn't write that
0.01%:  he doesn't write that well
0.01%:  it's made him like a
0.01%:  we'll ignore the
0.01%:  I'll have to read
0.01%:  we might as well move
0.01%:  I don't see how we'd ever get him
0.01%:  it was me!!
0.01%:  it's this old
0.01%:  he said the word '
0.01%:  I've no idea who said
0.01%:  it was me who made this
0.01%:  he's looked
0.01%:  that's wrong we
0.01%:  this awesome
0.01%:  what has
0.01%:  we're still moving
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that's what we
0.01%:  it's like the two are
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird to
0.01%:  I did the words
0.01%:  I think it's called either
0.01%:  now that I've said the words it seems like we'd all
0.01%:  no wait there
0.04%:  no wait there's like
0.01%:  no wait there's like twelve
0.01%:  no wait there's a
0.01%:  no wait there's like eight
0.01%:  this makes me wish I went
0.01%:  it's like third
0.01%:  the world's kinda awesome
0.01%:  these all
0.01%:  what I've said here is making
0.01%:  it was called things
0.01%:  it's called divide
0.01%:  this is all I've got to
0.01%:  I'd like him to sign
0.01%:  he gave it the less
0.01%:  we're doing this at
0.01%:  while we're at it I'll have
0.01%:  I'm making the last words
0.01%:  I'd still like to give him
0.01%:  now I've heard
0.01%:  we live in the world as
0.01%:  I have no idea where we'
0.01%:  there isn't a good
0.01%:  I think it goes
0.01%:  it's more like he was the last
0.01%:  he's still a mat
0.01%:  what I'd like to see is the world'
0.01%:  he's still the world
0.01%:  he's still alive and it's the
0.01%:  I think we write
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it was
0.01%:  that's all the work I've got
0.01%:  this is the song
0.01%:  it's more a side
0.01%:  it makes his sem
0.01%:  this is how I read
0.01%:  I've said these
0.01%:  I've said these things
0.01%:  let's give it
0.01%:  I'd like to see his grades
0.01%:  man we
0.01%:  it's his dad who wrote
0.01%:  he's still alive so I need
0.01%:  he doesn't get that
0.01%:  I think he is called
0.01%:  he was making other
0.01%:  I've made those things
0.01%:  it's more the lack
0.01%:  we think we're
0.01%:  it's more like game
0.01%:  I made this movie
0.01%:  there's like twelve things we
0.01%:  I might've called it the
0.01%:  I'm kinda more
0.01%:  it's making me sad I
0.01%:  let's stick to
0.01%:  he drank
0.01%:  it's like this great
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we've come
0.01%:  a little
0.01%:  that's like the worst '
0.01%:  I don't agree with his ideas
0.01%:  it was the words
0.01%:  that nick
0.01%:  that's his weird
0.01%:  seems kinda
0.01%:  we've got more
0.01%:  I'd give him a
0.01%:  it's like a whole genre
0.01%:  this is hell
0.01%:  we've all agreed to stick with the less
0.01%:  he said he likes it
0.01%:  the title makes
0.01%:  I'd write the whole
0.01%:  that seems like it'd go
0.01%:  I might have time
0.01%:  it's kinda a cr
0.01%:  what I'd like to do is get him
0.01%:  I might write this down some
0.01%:  it will take me
0.01%:  I'm told he was
0.01%:  we're called the
0.01%:  I've done this like
0.01%:  this is the new
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's hard to solve
0.01%:  wait where did this go
0.01%:  I'm doing a thesis
0.01%:  it's more like I've made it
0.01%:  it's how he ended
0.01%:  he never talked to
0.01%:  that's all I get
0.01%:  it's still '
0.01%:  that's the new
0.01%:  it's wrong;
0.01%:  it's more like he's lived long
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week so we
0.01%:  I'd like to give credit to his
0.01%:  it's all he cares
0.01%:  now that I've come
0.01%:  let's stick with the sem
0.01%:  it's more like how he did
0.01%:  wait this whole time I've mis
0.01%:  wait a second I've got
0.01%:  wait a second I've got this
0.01%:  that's all I've talked
0.01%:  it's hard to tell given how
0.01%:  let's all move
0.01%:  that's so wrong
0.01%:  that's a lie it's called
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that we'd give
0.01%:  it's more dance
0.01%:  it's me who's said this
0.01%:  I made his nick
0.01%:  all I've got is some
0.01%:  it's more like a little
0.01%:  that's worth
0.01%:  that's worth like
0.01%:  it's hard to dec
0.01%:  we can't give the
0.01%:  we can't give the award
0.01%:  I can see this
0.01%:  what it's made him are
0.01%:  I've called him that so
0.01%:  I might have to draw
0.01%:  he said it was more
0.01%:  while I'm glad
0.01%:  all it did was make him win
0.01%:  when it comes to the
0.01%:  all I wrote was the
0.01%:  it's the game
0.01%:  he gets credit with
0.01%:  all he did was get the
0.01%:  we've all gone mad
0.01%:  it's like so
0.01%:  I've done some
0.01%:  let me clar
0.01%:  he's lived in
0.01%:  I think that's a good idea
0.01%:  he made these
0.01%:  the last word might
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time I'
0.01%:  I think we'll give him a
0.01%:  I don't see how that rel
0.01%:  the world we lived in had
0.01%:  I might've made the title
0.01%:  it's more like he's had an
0.01%:  I've got no idea what either
0.01%:  I've named it
0.01%:  he named his kids
0.01%:  it was he who co
0.01%:  this does make me wonder what'
0.01%:  I think he ate
0.01%:  what it did was make him wonder
0.01%:  what I'm doing is screw
0.01%:  I will admit that'
0.01%:  it's the same thing;
0.01%:  it's weird having to
0.01%:  this whole idea makes me want
0.01%:  it's more like he added some things
0.01%:  I kinda agree with him!!
0.01%:  this isn't what we were
0.01%:  the last line makes him
0.01%:  he's alive so he
0.01%:  it's given him a well
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's like the least
0.01%:  I don't have time to read his
0.01%:  it makes me wish he
0.01%:  it makes me wish he'd never
0.01%:  right now it's called
0.01%:  what it's done is make the word
0.01%:  I think he mess
0.01%:  we think it might'
0.01%:  he was like three
0.01%:  now I've said it this
0.01%:  it's me who called
0.01%:  I might as
0.01%:  I might as well write
0.02%:  I might as well write this
0.01%:  I might as well admit
0.01%:  I might as well admit this
0.01%:  I might as well write the
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird how he'
0.01%:  it has made him give
0.01%:  I still like it when he writes
0.01%:  I've added in some
0.01%:  it'll show
0.01%:  that's what's making
0.01%:  that gave me weird ideas
0.01%:  while we're asking
0.01%:  I'm asking this
0.01%:  it's more like social
0.01%:  I was wrong with
0.01%:  all I've got is this sweet
0.01%:  it's this video where
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well as with
0.01%:  how's
0.01%:  I did the second
0.01%:  we were all kind
0.01%:  we've still got a whole
0.01%:  I'm wrong it's a
0.01%:  we never called him that; we
0.01%:  he doesn't like what I wrote
0.01%:  I wish he'd stick
0.01%:  wait I think we're mess
0.01%:  we don't agree
0.03%:  we don't agree with his
0.02%:  we don't agree with this
0.01%:  we don't agree with the
0.01%:  we don't agree with him
0.01%:  we don't agree with his views
0.01%:  we don't agree with the last
0.01%:  we don't agree with his sem
0.01%:  I think it's great we
0.01%:  when asked
0.01%:  he's said to hate
0.01%:  it made him a lot
0.01%:  that's all I've got with me now
0.01%:  all I'm doing is c
0.01%:  this made me wish I was
0.01%:  it made me throw
0.01%:  it's where he talked
0.01%:  it's still where we
0.01%:  it's still where we live
0.01%:  even he
0.01%:  I'd love to see a
0.01%:  it's more like the dad with
0.01%:  I think it was me who gave
0.01%:  this is now the weird
0.01%:  I like how he
0.01%:  since he's still alive I might
0.01%:  this is where I've gotten
0.01%:  the whole world is dead
0.01%:  when I write them
0.01%:  this seems like it's more
0.01%:  it's said to have
0.01%:  he's dead this
0.01%:  I chose the word
0.01%:  he'd called it the
0.01%:  I kinda wish we were still the old
0.01%:  that's kinda weird how it came
0.01%:  all I did was sing the words
0.01%:  that's a lie; there's like twelve
0.01%:  there's a slight twist
0.01%:  it's more he's like
0.01%:  this doesn't go well with cream
0.01%:  it gets worse with each line
0.01%:  that last word is like
0.01%:  he's dead so it's weird I
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how well this goes
0.01%:  it's the worst movie
0.01%:  great
0.01%:  he's more the mid
0.01%:  he gave a sem
0.01%:  we've all got a
0.01%:  I think he's still alive; it
0.01%:  he's still alive; it's me
0.01%:  he's still alive; it's me who died
0.01%:  that doesn't work with '
0.01%:  I'ma make
0.01%:  it's more like we all stand
0.01%:  it's weird to see how
0.01%:  I'd invite
0.01%:  we're making all these
0.01%:  we'll let
0.01%:  we'll let him decide
0.01%:  we'll let him decide what
0.01%:  we'll let him down
0.01%:  he won't let me talk
0.01%:  I'm making this lie
0.01%:  what it's done is make him world'
0.01%:  he told
0.01%:  I think it's cool
0.01%:  I think he'll get over
0.01%:  the answer is still
0.01%:  it's racist
0.01%:  I wrote this song weeks
0.01%:  it's weird that I know the
0.01%:  wait his name'
0.01%:  he gets the nick
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well do a
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well add some
0.01%:  I think he missed it
0.01%:  I wrote that while living
0.01%:  this seems like it's a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how we've got these
0.01%:  while we're at it can we add
0.01%:  that was great
0.01%:  we'll give him the latter one
0.01%:  he's still alive or
0.01%:  this was a clever
0.01%:  I've tried to get
0.01%:  I've tried to get him
0.01%:  wait I'm making this worse;
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's worked at
0.01%:  I'm scared to ask him
0.01%:  we've had the word
0.01%:  I'd like to switch the
0.01%:  I've made him this!!
0.01%:  there's a whole second
0.01%:  it's all lies
0.01%:  that sc
0.01%:  this doesn't make the
0.01%:  he's got the middle
0.01%:  I've said all this twice
0.01%:  wait that's wrong it makes
0.01%:  this all went
0.01%:  when I said the
0.02%:  when I said the world
0.06%:  when I said the world we lived
0.01%:  I'd love some
0.01%:  I need to write this
0.01%:  we've made some slight
0.01%:  I did it wrong;
0.01%:  I wrote this all down while we
0.01%:  right now I'm a
0.01%:  I think he's a racist
0.01%:  it's what he did in grad
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who's dead
0.01%:  the whole idea is kind
0.01%:  it's me who was the
0.01%:  I think we've said all the
0.02%:  I think we've said all the words
0.01%:  I think we've said all the words we'
0.01%:  I'd make him
0.01%:  we've got him listed twice
0.01%:  when I said it'
0.07%:  when I said it's the world
0.04%:  when I said it's the world we lived
0.01%:  I think he made me
0.01%:  he's still alive and I got
0.01%:  it's a dick thing
0.01%:  it's kinda racist!!
0.01%:  I know little
0.01%:  I'm doing this as
0.01%:  the single
0.01%:  it's more like he gave it his
0.01%:  I added the last verse while
0.01%:  he did not give
0.01%:  this will make me rich
0.01%:  how did we ever
0.01%:  it still works with
0.01%:  it gives him that nick
0.01%:  I think this is a worse
0.01%:  I wish he were still alive to
0.01%:  I got tired
0.01%:  he miss
0.01%:  we'll give him his doctor title
0.01%:  I might've named
0.01%:  it's what it's called right
0.01%:  tried
0.01%:  he died in his
0.01%:  it was his work that made
0.01%:  he doesn't like it so
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I was the
0.01%:  we love
0.01%:  it's kinda worth
0.01%:  what it did was more
0.01%:  it's like the worst when
0.01%:  no it's hard
0.01%:  what I've said right now makes it seem
0.01%:  all his kids died
0.01%:  I don't like him either
0.01%:  it's hard to decide who wins
0.01%:  I might have messed it all
0.01%:  over 
0.01%:  I might've read this on
0.01%:  that's the clever
0.01%:  this isn't how we talk
0.01%:  it's verse
0.01%:  this is the song I'm
0.01%:  I kinda stole
0.01%:  that's a thing called
0.01%:  all the credit went
0.01%:  it's where it comes
0.01%:  I don't see how this came
0.01%:  it's a little dated
0.01%:  all I've done is make the word
0.01%:  I know all
0.01%:  it's made him a kind
0.01%:  I'm not clear how this
0.01%:  it's more like a love
0.06%:  it's more like a love child
0.01%:  it's more like a love child with
0.01%:  we've no idea what he
0.01%:  we've no idea what he likes
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well cook
0.01%:  I've messed this all
0.01%: ; that's wrong
0.01%:  all I know is that he gave
0.01%:  that line made him
0.01%:  I lied; that's the worst
0.01%:  he's never asked me what I'd do
0.01%:  he died a little
0.01%:  he died a little over
0.01%:  all he ever did was ask
0.01%:  I've said his name twice there
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd called it
0.01%:  now I'm like
0.01%:  what it did was more like give
0.01%:  I'm making that series
0.01%:  that's eight
0.01%:  that's eight words
0.01%:  while we're doing this let's do
0.01%:  I think we'll give it
0.01%:  he's still alive so make
0.01%:  it's the names
0.01%:  it's what I think
0.01%:  that was me who called
0.01%:  this was the least
0.01%:  this was the least weird
0.01%:  later
0.01%:  it's more like he was on
0.01%:  it's also where he came
0.01%:  all I did was string
0.01%:  it's kinda rad how he
0.01%:  it's a lie; I made
0.01%:  it's a lot like
0.01%:  we still don't agree
0.01%:  we don't give him credit as
0.01%:  I kinda made that whole
0.01%:  it's the second where I
0.01%:  I think we are
0.01%:  I did this all wrong;
0.01%:  it's kinda tragic how he's still
0.01%:  we're having the same
0.01%:  he's still alive and we meet
0.01%:  all we've come
0.01%:  I'll admit this is where
0.01%:  we'll have to get him to write
0.01%:  we still like the
0.01%:  that's a little weird coming
0.01%:  I wrote this down twice
0.01%:  this all might've made
0.01%:  I've no idea what either
0.01%:  give this
0.01%:  he's still alive and did some more
0.01%:  it's all weird
0.01%:  I'm an idiot
0.01%:  I like how it'
0.01%:  I like how it's called
0.01%:  it's a common
0.01%:  it's all one
0.03%:  it's all one word
0.01%:  we're all doomed and
0.01%:  ever since he asked
0.01%:  we think he did
0.01%:  he's still alive; I made it
0.01%:  it still reads
0.01%:  this is the world we once
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in that made me
0.01%:  I've made him a lot worse
0.01%:  all I know is that we've got
0.01%:  we're all glad
0.01%:  was it
0.01%:  this is what we're all
0.01%:  we're making all this shit
0.01%:  there's a logic
0.01%:  it's a whole degree
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in a while ago;
0.01%:  that's kinda racism
0.01%:  it's hard to know with
0.01%:  I'd like to get credit
0.01%:  it's kinda weird we've
0.01%:  this has gone weird
0.01%:  he missed a
0.01%:  he missed a word
0.01%:  he said '
0.01%:  it's like he's made
0.01%:  let me re
0.01%:  it made him the grand
0.01%:  I've read it;
0.01%:  there's a whole site
0.01%:  the whole idea was
0.01%:  I kinda wish this were made
0.01%:  wait that's a lie
0.01%:  what I've got here is some
0.01%:  it's made him a good
0.01%:  it's weird how I'm doing
0.01%:  we're the ones who did
0.01%:  the world we live in makes that
0.01%:  we've chosen
0.01%:  it's weird he's named
0.01%:  what he did was work in
0.01%:  what did he ever
0.01%:  I might like it
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd tried to
0.01%:  it's like the name
0.01%:  it's time travel
0.01%:  I wrote this while at
0.01%:  I'll give him that second
0.01%:  all he did was sketch some
0.01%:  while he's still
0.01%:  it's agreed
0.01%:  it doesn't have words
0.01%:  it doesn't have words like
0.01%:  that's while
0.01%:  all I have right
0.01%:  what he did was like write
0.01%:  what he did was like write down
0.01%:  what he did was like write down some
0.01%:  this word salad
0.01%:  it's like a whole class
0.01%:  I like the whole
0.01%:  it's making me wish I ate
0.01%:  I'd like to stress that while
0.01%:  that's like this
0.01%:  his real title was
0.01%:  I had him write most
0.01%:  the world we live in makes me wish we'
0.01%:  it's given his work the
0.01%:  that's a lie; he's got
0.01%:  that's the wrong '
0.01%:  here's the video
0.01%:  that's his doctor
0.01%:  it gave rise to the whole
0.01%:  I've got it all mess
0.01%:  I might've chosen
0.01%:  it's a wonder
0.01%:  made him that twice
0.01%:  holds
0.01%:  he'd made his
0.01%:  it was his grand
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; I've
0.01%:  the two ideas have
0.01%:  there was like no
0.01%:  he worked on all
0.01%:  I still kinda wish we
0.01%:  I still kinda wish we were
0.01%:  what I think we'll see
0.01%:  that's like all the credit
0.01%:  I might've messed this one
0.01%:  it's called the random
0.01%:  it's more like a child with
0.01%:  it's me who wrote the sem
0.01%:  all I did was make it
0.01%:  that made me wish I'd never asked
0.01%:  all he did was give some lower
0.01%:  it's what I've got
0.01%:  it's given me the
0.01%:  wait that's right
0.01%:  it's making me wish I were a
0.01%:  it makes me wonder what he'd do
0.01%:  wait where did the last
0.01%:  I've lost this
0.01%:  he thinks it's great
0.01%:  it's made him a rock
0.01%:  it was the term
0.01%:  I've missed the last
0.01%:  I don't see how there
0.01%:  I think it's well
0.01%:  that's the wrong voice
0.01%:  I've made it worse with the second
0.01%:  it'll make him the second
0.01%:  I think it was more him
0.01%:  don't read him
0.01%:  we will
0.01%:  we'll give him a second
0.01%:  it's like the world's most hated
0.01%:  I lost
0.01%:  I lost track
0.01%:  that's kinda racist I
0.01%:  that's kinda racist I'
0.01%:  I might have missed like
0.01%:  wait it's his
0.01%:  I think it's more a sem
0.01%:  since he's dead he's more
0.01%:  I did that right
0.01%:  it's the second we
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it's dis
0.01%:  we're still not 
0.01%:  I've heard it's not
0.01%:  it's this image
0.01%:  it's more like he's the old
0.01%:  that's wrong I've made
0.01%:  I'd like to get a word
0.01%:  he missed the mark
0.01%:  this made me decide
0.01%:  this is making me sad; I'd
0.01%:  I might have to rec
0.01%:  let's change the words
0.01%:  the world we live in is the most
0.01%:  I've added the line
0.01%:  what's weird is that some
0.01%:  I think we did this same
0.01%:  that led me
0.01%:  I might have missed a little
0.01%:  wait this is a
0.01%:  this is the last word
0.01%:  this is the last word I've
0.01%:  wait I'd like to change
0.01%:  that's more like what I was
0.01%:  it's this video game I'
0.01%:  let's get him a medal
0.01%:  I'd still like more
0.01%:  I got him
0.01%:  all he did was wonder what
0.01%:  that's all I wrote down while
0.01%:  I might've read some
0.01%:  this is me who'
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong the
0.01%:  that still seems
0.02%:  that still seems weird
0.01%:  that still seems like
0.01%:  I'd have liked to write
0.01%:  it's made him like the world
0.01%:  it's made him like the world's second
0.01%:  it's made him like the world's oldest
0.01%:  it's me who writes all
0.01%:  he said that'
0.01%:  he was real
0.01%:  this isn't the world I'
0.01%:  this makes me glad I never did
0.01%:  I've said this like 
0.01%:  I'd wanted
0.01%:  all it's done is get him hired
0.01%:  all I did with
0.01%:  that's all he did;
0.01%:  it's a horse
0.01%:  this ver
0.01%:  I'll go ahead and credit
0.01%:  I'll go ahead and credit him
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in some weeks
0.01%:  it's a longer
0.01%:  how did I write
0.01%:  I think it's made him dead
0.01%:  here's an
0.01%:  I think we've missed a whole
0.01%:  he's in a
0.01%:  I don't like this world we've made; we
0.01%:  I'm good with it
0.01%:  twice
0.01%:  I'm having this dream
0.01%:  I don't like these
0.01%:  we'd all love
0.01%:  we still have to write his
0.01%:  I'm in love with it
0.01%:  that gave me an
0.01%:  it's weird how this song
0.01%:  it's weird how this song came
0.01%:  I'm also making
0.01%:  that's the old
0.01%: ; it's a
0.01%:  that does seem like a weird
0.01%:  the world we live in was the same
0.01%:  wow that was like the
0.01%:  wow that was like the worst
0.01%:  wait we're all dead
0.01%:  it's this white
0.01%:  it never made him a god
0.01%:  we don't call '
0.01%:  what it's made him is less
0.01%:  with this new world
0.01%:  this is hard to make
0.01%:  it made him two
0.01%:  it's so awesome I might
0.01%:  this gives me new ideas
0.01%:  it's a close
0.01%:  that's a great line
0.01%:  it does seem weird
0.01%:  there's a lot I've made
0.01%:  I'd like to see where it goes with
0.01%:  it's more like he said the
0.01%:  that's right;
0.01%:  it's making all the
0.01%:  this is all ver
0.01%:  we don't call him a '
0.01%:  it's so weird that we've
0.01%:  I might need to review what
0.01%:  it's what he's called at
0.01%:  it's a little weird how when
0.01%:  this is the world I want
0.01%:  I drew this while
0.01%:  I might like to write
0.01%:  while it's called the
0.01%:  what's the time
0.01%:  this is the world we live in as
0.01%:  that's weird since he's like
0.01%:  it's more like he got his name
0.01%:  it's the degree
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we ended
0.01%:  it's even more awesome
0.01%:  we made that whole
0.01%:  I'll give him the title
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I talk
0.01%:  it's more like a side thing
0.01%:  it's more like a side thing he'
0.01%:  let's stick with his
0.01%:  I think he is dead
0.01%:  he's won like
0.01%:  what I've told
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's kind
0.01%:  it's more like he was moved
0.01%:  he doesn't seem like he was
0.01%:  we don't have the world
0.01%:  we don't have the world we
0.01%:  that's still his
0.01%:  wait this didn
0.01%:  I think he's a direct
0.01%:  we're doing well with the
0.01%:  I don't make
0.01%:  it's more like it made
0.01%:  I'd like to live in a world with
0.01%:  it's all he's ever asked
0.01%:  this isn't how it
0.01%:  I'll let him write his
0.01%:  wait he's called the
0.01%:  it's a little hard to make
0.01%:  make it
0.01%:  I'd like to dis
0.01%:  I'm still alive
0.01%:  this video is called
0.01%:  the answer was
0.01%:  what I did was write down some
0.01%:  I've got a hard
0.01%:  I've got a hard time with
0.01%:  it's more like he's so
0.01%:  I've added the last eight
0.01%:  that's all I've got while we wait
0.01%:  it's worse than I made
0.01%:  he made that nick
0.01%:  all I did was mess with the words in
0.01%:  it's what he's worked
0.01%:  we're a little sketch
0.01%:  that might've worked well
0.01%:  it's the one where we
0.01%:  it's thesis
0.01%:  I think this came
0.01%:  I think we'll go with sem
0.01%:  I'ma little
0.01%:  ignore all
0.01%:  what it did was give the world a new
0.01%:  I've waited this
0.01%:  I've waited this whole
0.01%:  he's dead; I think
0.01%:  he's a giant
0.01%:  I think the title was more
0.01%:  I'm making all this sh
0.01%:  I'd like to have these
0.02%:  I'd like to have these words
0.01%:  it's more like I saw
0.01%:  the kid
0.01%:  we have no idea who'
0.01%:  I called him and
0.01%:  I called him and asked
0.01%:  I called him and asked him to
0.01%:  I called him and asked him to write
0.01%:  I called him and asked him to give
0.01%:  we've no idea what he's like!!
0.01%:  we'll have to go
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked with me some
0.01%:  it's clear we've all gone
0.01%:  I think it's great how we've all come
0.01%:  while we're at it we've also got
0.01%:  it's down
0.01%:  it's down there
0.01%:  he's dead now so we'll
0.01%:  what I'd like more is some
0.01%:  the latter's kind
0.01%:  it's a law
0.01%:  it's a law review
0.01%:  with time
0.01%:  this whole idea kind
0.01%:  in this case I
0.01%:  in this case I'
0.01%:  that's all I've got; he
0.01%:  that's where I'm at
0.01%:  it's more like he's having a mid
0.01%:  it was called more things
0.01%:  I kinda made those words
0.01%:  I think he'll dis
0.01%:  there's like a whole movie
0.01%:  that's made him kind
0.01%:  this is what made me decide
0.01%:  it's more like what we'
0.01%:  it's more like what we'd call the
0.01%:  it's like the dad
0.01%:  this all gets weird
0.01%:  called him
0.01%:  what's weird is that I've got like
0.01%:  he's lived to see
0.01%:  all I did was read the w
0.01%:  what's with me
0.01%:  this made me write the
0.01%:  I think we agree that
0.01%:  the reason I've
0.01%:  the second made
0.01%:  it's the worst case
0.01%:  now that I've said it we'll
0.01%:  I have mis
0.01%:  what he's done is worked
0.01%:  that's where I came in
0.01%:  there's limits to what I'll
0.01%:  this isn't what I've
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like there's a lot
0.01%:  it's hard to know what else
0.01%:  man I've got
0.01%:  it's his awesome
0.01%:  that seemed like the
0.01%:  that seemed like the wrong
0.01%:  this is the sc
0.01%:  we've all agreed we'd
0.01%:  it's his master
0.01%:  he's still alive; he's good
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as with
0.01%:  that's how it reads
0.01%:  we still don't have a direct
0.01%:  the latter is a lie
0.01%:  it's the worst song I
0.01%:  we still have to make
0.01%:  it's made him the king
0.01%:  I can't write the whole
0.01%:  I've kinda made this whole
0.01%:  he's still alive; we're making
0.01%:  that's where we've
0.01%:  I'd heard it's the
0.01%:  it's said his
0.01%:  it's worse with
0.01%:  that made me write this
0.01%:  what it's done is make me write
0.01%:  I think we've all missed the word
0.01%:  all he did was derive some the
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how it's the
0.01%:  it's the same title
0.01%:  it's his work on the class
0.01%:  that's wrong; I've made
0.01%:  it's like the worst god
0.01%:  I think that came
0.01%:  it's more like he set
0.01%:  his math
0.01%:  he's a legit
0.01%:  he gets a little mad
0.01%:  he gets a little mad when I
0.01%:  this is how I get
0.01%:  i'm making all
0.01%:  I can't see how we
0.02%:  I can't see how we're still
0.01%:  I can't see how we're still alive
0.01%:  the last line makes me
0.01%:  when I read this it'
0.01%:  he'll hate it
0.01%:  we've all come a
0.01%:  his work was well
0.01%:  I think the latter'
0.01%:  I've worked in
0.01%:  I've worked in this
0.01%:  I think we'd call them
0.01%:  it's hard to give him a
0.01%:  it's still the 
0.01%:  this made his work even
0.01%:  give me a second while I write that
0.01%:  I think he gave me
0.01%:  I lied he wasn
0.01%:  this is the world we did
0.01%:  it was more like he gave
0.01%:  it's made him called the
0.01%:  I think we'd have to write
0.01%:  it's still like the same
0.01%:  I gave this talk while
0.01%:  I made this video
0.01%:  I'd like to see it solved
0.01%:  I'm glad this whole
0.01%:  it's weird that he gave
0.01%:  wait I've messed that
0.01%:  this doesn't make him well
0.01%:  it's the world we'd like to live in; we
0.01%:  he's more like its god
0.01%:  I've done this with
0.01%:  I'm making all his
0.01%:  it's made him the entire
0.01%:  it's more like his ideas have
0.01%:  I think the world's moved
0.01%:  it's more like he's died
0.01%:  I've added the rest
0.01%:  the latter was made
0.01%:  I've come to terms
0.08%:  I've come to terms with this
0.04%:  I've come to terms with the idea
0.04%:  I've come to terms with this new
0.02%:  I've come to terms with it
0.01%:  I've come to terms with what
0.01%:  I've come to terms with all
0.01%:  I've come to terms with his
0.01%:  no wait he's still
0.01%:  I'll have to admit
0.01%:  wait I've made that
0.01%:  it's a real thing I've
0.01%:  he did not make
0.01%:  it's all either
0.01%:  I kinda wish he'd tried
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in two
0.20%:  that was the world we lived in two weeks
0.01%:  wait we're moving
0.01%:  can we like
0.01%:  it's more like he's not a
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it gives me
0.01%:  it's time I
0.01%:  I've no idea how well he gets
0.01%:  it's more like lim
0.01%:  it's kinda great how we've made this
0.01%:  it's more like what's with
0.01%:  that's what it's called I
0.01%:  he was there in
0.01%:  all that did was give me the weird
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's so old
0.01%:  it's all this other
0.01%:  I did some work with
0.01%:  all he did was give some nice
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which we've said
0.01%:  he'd never eat it
0.01%:  what he did was go
0.01%:  I have other
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work with me
0.01%:  what I did there is mess
0.01%:  all I know is he gets
0.01%:  all I know is he gets credit
0.01%:  I made that '
0.01%:  all I ever did was change the title
0.01%:  he's got three
0.02%:  he's got three kids
0.01%:  he's got three kids and
0.01%:  that's his real nick
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed his
0.01%:  we've also called it the
0.01%:  it's the cool
0.01%:  he still gets his
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week I'
0.01%:  I had no idea who
0.01%:  we need to give credit
0.01%:  we're having this talk
0.01%:  it's this thing called '
0.01%:  I kinda hate how
0.01%:  I wish he'd make
0.01%:  the title's weird
0.01%:  I'm making the word '
0.01%:  these are called the
0.01%:  their sem
0.01%:  that does make me wish
0.01%:  I'd give it a solid
0.01%:  while we're at it let's not give
0.01%:  while we're at it let's not give him
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it'd make
0.01%:  I'm making that lie
0.01%:  what are the odds we'll get
0.01%:  we all think he's more
0.01%:  where did I leave this
0.01%:  let's all agree we've
0.01%:  it's made him win the 
0.01%:  I think we've all made this worse!!
0.01%:  he never said his
0.01%:  I think we've all tried
0.01%:  it makes more sense with
0.01%:  he'd never asked me
0.01%:  it's a drink
0.01%:  wait what's wrong with me I'm like
0.01%:  this made things worse;
0.01%:  that's less a
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved that whole
0.01%:  we can still give
0.01%:  it's ac
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is all
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's great
0.01%:  I kinda wish we were still at the stage
0.01%:  I think the rest
0.01%:  he's weird and
0.01%:  it was more like I
0.01%:  I'd like to give him some
0.01%:  this has made me re
0.01%:  all we know is he's dead
0.01%:  it's when he solved
0.01%:  he has more
0.01%:  it's like all those
0.01%:  we've all agreed that his nick
0.01%:  it might've said
0.01%:  what did he eat
0.01%:  this is how we ended
0.01%:  all I've done here is add
0.01%:  I wrote this song while we walked
0.01%:  I kinda wish he wrote
0.01%:  we don't call him that over
0.01%:  what I've said here is so
0.01%:  let's never do
0.01%:  let's never do this
0.01%:  this might work in
0.01%:  I make him the
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've all got
0.01%:  this makes me wonder who'
0.01%:  I was wrong; it's called
0.01%:  it'll take more
0.01%:  he's still alive so we can't write
0.01%:  wait that's like the world's second
0.01%:  there's like twelve named
0.01%:  I had like
0.01%:  we don't like the word
0.01%:  it's all we do
0.01%:  it's called worse
0.01%:  it's called worse things
0.01%:  I did all these
0.01%:  I did all these things
0.01%:  it's a word game called
0.01%:  it's him making
0.01%:  that doesn't make me
0.01%:  he died last week so the
0.01%:  it made him have
0.01%:  all his work since
0.01%:  he's dead so he's like
0.01%:  that seemed like it might'
0.01%:  the world we live in was set
0.01%:  we won't call
0.01%:  it's said he's more
0.01%:  that's kinda hor
0.01%:  wow that worked
0.01%:  he died in like '
0.01%:  it's the lower
0.01%:  that made me cringe while
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've all agreed
0.01%:  I never said he did
0.01%:  that doesn't read well with
0.01%:  it's the middle name he
0.01%:  it's the middle name he gave
0.01%:  I've kinda come
0.01%:  that's the wrong met
0.01%:  it's less awesome when
0.01%:  it's all I've wanted
0.01%:  we don't have time to hear
0.01%:  we might have a
0.01%:  he's either alive
0.01%:  that's me!! I
0.01%:  that's me!! I wrote
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how that
0.01%:  he's alive and will
0.01%:  it goes like
0.01%:  it goes like this
0.01%:  he's still living so he
0.01%:  it's no
0.01%:  this is what we'd
0.01%:  now that we've heard it we
0.01%:  that's a thing we do
0.01%:  it made him write the
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd have
0.01%:  it's like eight whole
0.01%:  it's the single hard
0.01%:  we might want to remove
0.01%:  the title is a
0.01%:  that's a little weird how we'
0.01%:  I'd make that
0.01%:  it seemed
0.01%:  I think we've all made it clear we
0.01%:  I think we've all made it clear we'd
0.01%:  all I did was write the song while
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is st
0.01%:  it's more like he's given the same
0.01%:  this does seem like the world we live in;
0.01%:  I'm glad we never met
0.01%:  he doesn't hate
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree this was
0.01%:  who was it
0.01%:  I think he's still alive or
0.01%:  I think it's che
0.01%:  those aren
0.01%:  it's like what the
0.01%:  since he's still alive we might
0.01%:  I gave the credit
0.01%:  I think the two
0.01%:  all I did was write down this
0.01%:  I know almost
0.01%:  that's me I
0.01%:  it's the great
0.01%:  what it's done is made him get sick
0.01%:  I'm still taking
0.01%:  it's lat
0.01%:  I've done all
0.01%:  I've done all the work
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed it's this
0.01%:  we don't ever talk
0.01%:  I've read all the
0.01%:  it's a twelve
0.01%:  I don't recall how his
0.01%:  what I'm doing makes
0.01%:  it's the same thing twice over
0.01%:  the title is more
0.01%:  he's kinda mad
0.01%:  he's kinda mad at me right
0.01%:  he's still alive so he's a
0.01%:  we live in the same world as we did two
0.01%:  we live in the same world as we did two weeks
0.01%:  I added the rest
0.01%:  I'll admit there's no
0.01%:  he did not like
0.01%:  he never called it that!!
0.01%:  that was more like his middle
0.01%:  it's this line
0.01%:  it's total
0.01%:  we still need to give
0.02%:  we still need to give him credit
0.01%:  we still need to give him his
0.01%:  he's got some weird ideas
0.01%:  it's like this song where I
0.01%:  this whole time I've still
0.01%:  it's weird how his middle
0.01%:  I'd like to see where his
0.01%:  he doesn't love
0.01%:  I never said which
0.01%:  wait he never asked
0.01%:  I don't have the time or skill
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked with me a
0.01%:  we'll have to take
0.01%:  we call them other
0.01%:  he's cool either
0.01%:  this is all secret
0.01%:  it's made him the latter and
0.01%:  that reads like it was
0.01%:  I might have like mess
0.01%:  since his
0.01%:  this doesn't work well as lim
0.01%:  that's still valid
0.01%:  it's not where
0.01%:  there's no magic
0.01%:  it's either that
0.01%:  I don't see his
0.01%:  I'm the one who made it
0.01%:  I lied there's like two
0.01%:  it's more like his cat
0.01%:  I'd like to see him in
0.01%:  that's wrong he's like
0.01%:  wait what's wrong with me I've lost
0.01%:  it doesn't work well with the ac
0.01%:  it's more like his most well
0.01%:  we'll need more
0.01%:  making me
0.01%:  it's the latter I'm making
0.01%:  it's more like having his
0.01%:  I'd rate this
0.01%:  I see how
0.01%:  I see how this
0.01%:  it's still secret
0.01%:  that'd make his middle
0.01%:  he had no
0.01%:  I don't read this well
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well while we
0.01%:  wait that's mess
0.01%:  that's the world we live in is
0.01%:  he was the latter
0.01%:  he also died
0.01%:  it's at the
0.01%:  while I'm here let'
0.01%:  while I'm here let's talk
0.01%:  it's made him the latter!!
0.01%:  I might need to read
0.01%:  that last line is where I'
0.01%:  it reads like he
0.01%:  I think he's got some weird ideas
0.01%:  no idea which
0.01%:  it seems like there
0.01%:  it seems like there's a whole
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well con
0.01%:  what's weird is how I
0.01%:  that's a weird com
0.01%:  all I've done is make his
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how it's come
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that we live
0.01%:  where did I get those
0.01%:  he was less
0.01%:  I think we've made it clear we
0.01%:  as we've
0.01%:  what he's done is give me
0.01%:  I think we wrote this
0.01%:  this is what I write
0.01%:  he's still alive so he gets kind
0.01%:  it's all the kids who
0.01%:  now that we've talked this
0.01%:  it's in his
0.01%:  he solved it in '
0.01%:  this isn't the most
0.01%:  that makes me wish I'd done
0.01%:  now that I've said it's the
0.03%:  now that I've said it's the world
0.01%:  I've heard he doesn't like it;
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which view
0.01%:  it's making me wish that I'd read
0.01%:  I've messed with this
0.01%:  that's made it
0.01%:  I'd like it more
0.01%:  we've had it wrong all this time it
0.01%:  I'd give it to him
0.01%:  I'd give it to him either
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he ever had
0.01%:  I might've kinda made those
0.01%:  he's still worked
0.01%:  what I'd like to see is more
0.01%:  all I did was give him the credit
0.01%:  it's all he gets
0.02%:  it's all he gets credit
0.01%:  it's the the
0.01%:  now we
0.01%:  now we're all
0.01%:  I think we've all agreed it'd
0.01%:  the second verse is what
0.01%:  I'd still like to answer
0.01%:  what he did was solve it
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we've still
0.01%:  there's this video game in
0.01%:  it's called modern
0.01%:  we've added that line
0.01%:  it might've come
0.01%:  what I did was write this
0.01%:  I'd like to see what he'd do
0.01%:  what he's done is make me write
0.01%:  that seems like it's more
0.01%:  don't tell him I said his work made
0.01%:  we'll give him the award as
0.01%:  I did it with
0.01%:  I recall
0.01%:  it's more like the things
0.01%:  that's a lie!! I made
0.01%:  I wrote this awhile
0.01%:  it's all lower
0.01%:  this is the worst week I
0.01%:  it's like the world is
0.01%:  there's a kid named
0.01%:  that's all the review
0.01%:  no wait I've made
0.01%:  no wait I've made him
0.01%:  wait let's go
0.01%:  I think the game
0.01%:  I think the game is called
0.01%:  it does make me wonder which is
0.01%:  he wrote an
0.01%:  there's a well
0.01%:  I've got the rest
0.01%:  I kinda dig the
0.01%:  it's kinda a good
0.01%:  i've
0.01%:  when he wrote it it
0.07%:  when he wrote it it was called
0.01%:  when he wrote it it was called '
0.01%:  it's made the world
0.01%:  all he ever did was show
0.01%:  while we're at it let's leave
0.01%:  he's like this old
0.01%:  I kinda wish it were still
0.01%:  what I've said is the most
0.01%:  all I was
0.01%:  it makes me sad when I write
0.01%:  that's his middle name; it's weird
0.01%:  he thinks it's weird
0.01%:  it's me who's making it
0.01%:  I added those last three
0.01%:  I'm doing all these
0.01%:  I still have no idea who
0.01%:  I still have no idea who likes
0.01%:  we can't read this
0.01%:  what it's done is give the
0.01%:  what it's done is give the world
0.01%:  it was like eight other
0.01%:  it's like god
0.01%:  while we're at it let's add this
0.01%:  I'd like to see how that reads
0.01%:  it's kinda more the
0.01%:  we'll let him decide that
0.01%:  I've looked it
0.01%:  it's his ideas
0.01%:  it was the weird
0.01%:  we all knew this was
0.01%:  it's worth at
0.01%:  we're all now
0.01%:  now that I've read it it
0.02%:  now that I've read it it's called
0.01%:  now that I've read it it's like
0.01%:  now that I've read it it seems
0.01%:  now that I've read it it seems like
0.03%:  now that I've read it it seems like he'
0.02%:  now that I've read it it seems like he was
0.01%:  now that I've read it it seems like he's called
0.01%:  what I've said makes me wonder
0.01%:  what I'd like right now is some t
0.01%:  we've all agreed it was
0.01%:  all I did was mess with his
0.01%:  it's more that his name
0.01%:  we chose
0.01%:  it's a weight
0.01%:  what I said there does
0.01%:  the last two lines are made
0.01%:  while we're at it can we talk
0.01%:  I think he's a d
0.01%:  it's a logic
0.01%:  it's his degree in
0.01%:  we've all worked this
0.01%:  we agree
0.01%:  when I said that
0.01%:  I'd heard it was named
0.01%:  he said he wrote
0.01%:  I think he died so
0.01%:  I missed that
0.01%:  it seems he died
0.01%:  wait let's change
0.01%:  I think that's sem
0.01%:  it's weird how well it
0.01%:  called it
0.01%:  it's like their names
0.01%:  that made it worse; I've
0.01%:  it's his sister who came
0.01%:  it's all we've got to
0.01%:  I think he's almost
0.01%:  who cares what I
0.01%:  who cares what I'm doing
0.01%:  I think it's great we've
0.01%:  we call it the other
0.01%:  I've made him the world's second
0.01%:  it's made him the less
0.01%:  it gets worse the
0.01%:  it seems like he's never
0.01%:  I was wrong it's called the
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this world is
0.01%:  that might make sense
0.01%:  that seems more
0.01%:  that's like the worst we've done
0.01%:  I'm glad this is the world we lived
0.01%:  I've had it wrong the
0.01%:  I like to call him the
0.01%:  I've added the latter
0.01%:  we've called his work
0.01%:  it's like that other
0.01%:  I've done the
0.01%:  I've done this like three
0.01%:  this is either
0.01%:  there's like a whole song I
0.01%:  wait this doesn't make me
0.01%:  I like how the second
0.01%:  he's alive and his work
0.01%:  I can't see how we'll
0.02%:  I can't see how we'll ever get
0.02%:  I can't see how we'll ever get this
0.01%:  we all made
0.01%:  all he did was throw
0.01%:  now I'd like to hear
0.01%:  I think all he did was draw
0.01%:  I think all he did was draw some
0.01%:  since we've all agreed this
0.01%:  I think he was a doctor
0.01%:  that's even worse with
0.01%:  doesn't work
0.01%:  he's called '
0.01%:  it's hard to make this song
0.01%:  what it's done is get me
0.01%:  it makes me wonder how he
0.01%:  this has made me decide I'
0.01%:  it's so great I've
0.01%:  the second word is the
0.01%:  that's where I was coming
0.01%:  he gets a little weird with
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as I might
0.01%:  it's hard to see how it
0.01%:  I knew all
0.01%:  I knew all this
0.01%:  he never did claim
0.01%:  it's more a thing called
0.01%:  it's worth asking how
0.01%:  that got me
0.01%:  I wasted
0.01%:  he's white
0.01%:  it makes me wonder who
0.01%:  the later is
0.01%:  how's that
0.01%:  this is making it hard
0.01%:  he's dead so this
0.01%:  I'll admit this is making
0.01%:  he'll never get his
0.01%:  there's a video game called this!!
0.01%:  he did all this work on
0.01%:  I don't like this world we've made; this
0.01%:  this might've worked a
0.01%:  it's more like a thing called
0.01%:  it was me who called them
0.01%:  do we know
0.01%:  do we know what
0.01%:  I'd like a little
0.01%:  all it did was solve
0.01%:  wait I made him
0.01%:  I'm so scared
0.01%:  I've made him that since we
0.01%:  I've made him that since we're still
0.01%:  we don't give him credit with
0.01%:  it's this song here
0.01%:  we live in a world with the
0.01%:  we live in a world with the same
0.01%:  it's kinda how the
0.01%:  it's kinda gross;
0.01%:  I lied; he's never talked
0.01%:  I'm having the worst week
0.01%:  we'd call that the
0.01%:  we're the ones who made
0.01%:  he's still alive and direct
0.01%:  what it's done is get him some awards
0.01%:  all the math
0.01%:  there's this video called
0.01%:  I've made it like
0.01%:  I've made it like this
0.01%:  the last word was like
0.01%:  what he did was tell
0.01%:  I had to write this down
0.01%:  I don't get what he was
0.01%:  this isn't weird
0.01%:  I've made it worse this
0.01%:  I've made it worse this whole
0.01%:  I got these
0.01%:  he never said he liked it;
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad we're still
0.01%:  I'm glad we have that
0.01%:  I've said all there
0.01%:  I've made it worse with all these ed
0.01%:  what it's made him is win
0.01%:  we won't have
0.01%:  he's sorta
0.01%:  I've said that three
0.01%:  I kinda wrote these
0.01%:  now I've said it three
0.01%:  all he did was write down the '
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week so I was
0.01%:  wait I've made things
0.01%:  wait I've made things worse with
0.01%:  he's still alive so it's more the
0.01%:  his middle name's like that
0.01%:  that's what it's called I looked
0.01%:  it seems he'd
0.01%:  he made me think
0.01%:  I've read it!!
0.01%:  I'd have to write this
0.01%:  where did I leave the
0.01%:  what he wrote is called
0.01%:  that's more like twelve
0.01%:  I like how this goes
0.01%:  that's weak
0.01%:  we'll give him the award in two
0.04%:  we'll give him the award in two weeks
0.01%:  there's still 
0.01%:  I'd give the credit to the
0.01%:  I think we all owe
0.01%:  what it's done is give me the world's least
0.01%:  I think he'd go
0.01%:  I made some slight alter
0.01%:  I think he drew a
0.01%:  what I've said there so
0.01%:  it made him a doctor
0.01%:  that makes him closer
0.01%:  his claim
0.01%:  he won't like me
0.01%:  it's still right
0.01%:  that's kinda worse
0.01%:  I think the last verse
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in last week; we made
0.01%:  this is all wrong I'm like
0.01%:  I've made him write it
0.01%:  he might've done work
0.01%:  the movie's coming
0.01%:  it's weird that I've talked
0.01%:  I'd still like to see where this
0.01%:  there's like eight sem
0.01%:  give him a medal
0.01%:  it's all I've read this sem
0.01%:  it's more like he's old
0.01%:  I'd love to read his sem
0.01%:  while we're at it I've added this
0.01%:  it's the whole reason
0.01%:  he called it more
0.01%:  he kinda made
0.01%:  that last line gives me the
0.01%:  we don't make him
0.01%:  it was called the word
0.01%:  I've had this idea since like
0.01%:  that's the worst I've done all
0.09%:  that's the worst I've done all week
0.01%:  that's the worst I've done all week!!
0.01%:  he's more like a middle child;
0.01%:  he's alive and it
0.01%:  he's alive and it's like
0.01%:  wait I've got the whole
0.01%:  can we get him
0.01%:  all this talk
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree that's it
0.01%:  all I'm doing is mis
0.01%:  I'd class
0.01%:  we all got here
0.01%:  it was like the second sem
0.01%:  wow this is kind
0.01%:  it's a little weird how I've made them
0.01%:  this might make sense
0.01%:  I see this
0.01%:  this is what we get
0.01%:  he might've done some
0.01%:  it's like this whole genre
0.01%:  we think he dis
0.01%:  what I said was more like the
0.01%:  all he ever did was talk
0.01%:  we've still got this
0.01%:  it's nice that we have
0.01%:  that's me making
0.01%:  there's like eight co
0.01%:  it's a light
0.01%:  I'd love to hear his side
0.01%:  he's still alive; we're doing
0.01%:  he gets that credit
0.01%:  I wrote that in case
0.01%:  it was when he tried
0.01%:  it's like when we
0.01%:  there is now
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he was called
0.01%:  it's still a crime
0.01%:  it's a shame he'
0.01%:  I lied it was called
0.01%:  it doesn't read well like
0.01%:  all I'm doing here is the
0.01%:  it's as close
0.01%:  I'm making his thesis title
0.01%:  he's not dead like
0.01%:  I'd like to go with the
0.01%:  we've still got him
0.01%:  the term '
0.01%:  I'd still give him credit
0.01%:  it never made me
0.01%:  I don't read the
0.01%:  the world we live in seems like
0.01%:  her sem
0.01%:  the world we live in goes
0.01%:  we still don't care what
0.01%:  I was still
0.01%:  he meant
0.01%:  this is making a
0.01%:  while we're at it let's add a
0.01%:  I wrote it while making
0.01%:  we don't call him that; it'd give
0.01%:  it's this decade
0.01%:  what it's done is made me wish
0.01%:  now I have
0.01%:  that's me there
0.01%:  his ideas have made
0.01%:  now that we've made it the
0.02%:  now that we've made it the world
0.03%:  now that we've made it the world we
0.01%:  I think we've said it
0.01%:  that's this week's word
0.01%:  it's a search
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird that we
0.01%:  it's still kinda weird that we've
0.01%:  that was me!! I
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to send
0.01%:  I think it's all made
0.01%:  all that did was get
0.01%:  all that did was get him
0.01%:  it's making him decide
0.01%:  it's making him decide what
0.01%:  it's a little weird he's dead
0.01%:  I think his degree is called
0.01%:  I think it was the word
0.01%:  I secret
0.01%:  this is kinda tragic
0.01%:  this song has
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he solved
0.01%:  I can't do his work
0.01%:  he still gets emails
0.01%:  I kinda wish we still lived where
0.01%:  all he did was write down most
0.01%:  that gets worse when
0.01%:  I kinda wish this were still
0.01%:  it's the wrong sem
0.01%:  it's a cross
0.01%:  it's a w
0.01%:  this is so weird I'm making
0.01%:  there's like a whole new
0.01%:  the world was like that
0.01%:  it's like the two things were
0.01%:  that's the world we live in so
0.01%:  that made him worse
0.01%:  I think we wasted
0.01%:  I think all the
0.01%:  I think all the credit
0.01%:  that might make a
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong that's the
0.01%:  this is the worst I've made a
0.01%:  it's what he calls it
0.01%:  it's more like he's a living
0.01%:  this is a song
0.01%:  I'm the doctor
0.01%:  this is how I came
0.01%:  it's like he's the grand
0.01%:  it throws
0.01%:  no wait I made
0.01%:  we'd still need
0.01%:  that doesn't work; we
0.01%:  that doesn't work; we'
0.01%:  that doesn't work; we've
0.01%:  that doesn't work; we'll
0.01%:  we're the ones who get
0.01%:  that's his email
0.01%:  I wrote this while naked
0.01%:  he'd love
0.01%:  it's the same man
0.01%:  he was given the term
0.01%:  this is kinda awesome!!
0.01%:  no I made this
0.01%:  we all agree it's the most
0.01%:  I said it wrong;
0.01%:  isn't he dead
0.01%:  the all
0.01%:  we've all agreed with me
0.01%:  it's over a
0.02%:  it's over a decade
0.01%:  it's over a decade old
0.01%:  wait that's him
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we moved
0.01%:  he's never said what'
0.01%:  the latter was the
0.01%:  I think it's less clear
0.01%:  I look him
0.01%:  he called it what
0.01%:  I've no idea how this rel
0.01%:  we can still give him the
0.01%:  wait he's dead now right
0.01%:  that gives him like two
0.01%:  what I wrote is the
0.01%:  how did we even get to
0.01%:  this new world seems like
0.01%:  I think we lost
0.01%:  I think we lost him
0.01%:  wait he's alive right
0.01%:  this series
0.01%:  these are two things
0.01%:  it's hard to know what we'll get
0.01%:  wow these
0.01%:  this talk has
0.01%:  it doesn't make him great
0.01%:  it's all real
0.01%:  I might've added in that
0.01%:  it's the world we all knew
0.01%:  it's still a secret how he got
0.01%:  I like him more as
0.01%:  wait I read
0.01%:  it's racism
0.01%:  I think we get the
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; we
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; we'
0.01%:  it doesn't make him that; we've
0.01%:  that gives me more
0.01%:  it seems like this might
0.01%:  all this makes me wonder
0.01%:  that's where I'd like to live
0.01%:  he's still mad
0.01%:  this last line makes me
0.01%:  we've all screw
0.01%:  all I've done is create
0.01%:  it's what made him well
0.01%:  we're on the
0.01%:  his work in these
0.01%:  I've said these things twice
0.01%:  there's seven
0.01%:  all we know is the
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome how well these
0.01%:  we've all heard this song
0.01%:  there's two sides
0.01%:  their names have
0.01%:  we've got a whole list
0.01%:  we made it all
0.01%:  we were doing this whole
0.01%:  man it's like the
0.01%:  the word I wanted was the
0.01%:  I might like this new world we've made a
0.01%:  wait there was like
0.01%:  I lied and he's still
0.01%:  it's so weird I can
0.01%:  I've no idea which word
0.01%:  he's still in the middle
0.01%:  it's made him the vice
0.01%:  while we're at it we've also added
0.01%:  it's like the third time
0.04%:  it's like the third time I've made
0.03%:  it's like the third time I've called
0.01%:  it's shit
0.01%:  with the latter
0.01%:  it makes me wish we had
0.01%:  I've called it wrong
0.01%:  it's weird how I can't get
0.01%:  it's weird how I can't get this
0.01%:  all I did was switch the words '
0.01%:  he's still alive; it's the
0.01%:  it's weird how I'm making
0.01%:  it's weird how I'm making this
0.01%:  he's made me write that twice
0.01%:  we've all agreed that since
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's make the
0.01%:  he'd more like the
0.01%:  I'd ask him to write his
0.01%:  it's more that his middle
0.01%:  I've hated
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad it
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad it's over
0.01%:  he's still alive so don't get
0.01%:  he's still alive so don't get him
0.01%:  he's still alive so don't get him mad
0.01%:  his work was still
0.01%:  it's all the work he
0.01%:  it's like that twice
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's got like
0.01%:  all he did there was make
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well add '
0.01%:  I think we might live
0.01%:  I'm having that
0.01%:  what is the word
0.01%:  I think the word we
0.01%:  this makes sense
0.01%:  it's a shame there
0.01%:  it's more like I saw the
0.01%:  don't tell him I gave
0.03%:  don't tell him I gave him credit
0.01%:  don't tell him I gave him a
0.01%:  we've taken the
0.01%:  it was me who'
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work I'll
0.01%:  I wish we still
0.02%:  I wish we still lived
0.01%:  I wish we still lived in the
0.01%:  I wrote this song while we talked
0.01%:  he signed
0.01%:  it's what we call them
0.01%:  I think he was legit
0.01%:  it's like a good
0.01%:  we all live in the
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how his
0.01%:  it's clear we've got some
0.01%:  it's like their whole lives
0.01%:  this song makes it
0.01%:  I've asked him
0.01%:  I've asked him to change
0.01%:  I've asked him to write
0.01%:  I've asked him to write the
0.01%:  it's like with
0.01%:  wait I'm making the
0.01%:  wait I'm making the whole
0.01%:  this doesn't work;
0.01%:  he's sad
0.01%:  I might have said it
0.01%:  this doesn't work well with me
0.01%:  he's still alive and I made it
0.01%:  it seems like he had
0.01%:  all I've done is talk
0.01%:  wait there's a second
0.01%:  I think he's middle
0.01%:  I think he's middle aged
0.01%:  it's more like god'
0.01%:  his main work is
0.01%:  doesn't this
0.01%:  doesn't this make
0.01%:  doesn't this make him
0.01%:  no he's called
0.01%:  what I've said is a
0.01%:  he's also the origin
0.01%:  all that did was give me weird
0.01%:  he said his work
0.01%:  that's all I know;
0.01%:  it was when he worked at
0.01%:  that was added
0.01%:  the word was '
0.01%:  I'd like to remove the last
0.01%:  we've lost the whole
0.01%:  all I've done is messed
0.01%:  all I've done is messed with
0.01%:  I have no idea right
0.01%:  it's meant
0.01%:  sc
0.01%:  what's weird is that we've got like
0.01%:  I think it said
0.01%:  this'll work
0.01%:  I don't see how this is ever
0.01%:  this is wrong!!
0.01%:  I might've messed the word
0.01%:  his name there
0.01%:  it's a metal
0.01%:  the last thing is made
0.01%:  he's still alive I was making
0.01%:  it was more like the sem
0.01%:  no it's his
0.01%:  no it's his work
0.01%:  wow this is like the most
0.01%:  it was me who gave him credit
0.01%:  I've no idea how he'd
0.01%:  I've no idea how he'd react
0.01%:  it's in the middle there
0.01%:  I've made him those two
0.01%:  his work was so
0.01%:  it's more like a new
0.01%:  I've kinda said
0.01%:  I think he'd still get
0.01%:  what did he even do
0.01%:  I asked him to write his
0.01%:  I can't see how either
0.01%:  it's kinda clever how this
0.01%:  while we're at it let's close
0.01%:  I think we've lost this
0.01%:  I don't have kids
0.01%:  I've called him that wrong
0.01%:  I kinda messed the rh
0.01%:  he was most well
0.01%:  we throw
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd called
0.01%:  that makes me wish I were dead
0.01%:  wait I don't get how
0.01%:  its title
0.01%:  its title was
0.01%:  asked him
0.01%:  that's kinda how I see
0.01%:  what I've said there is g
0.01%:  last week I wrote
0.01%:  what I did there was give a
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work as well with me
0.01%:  I made him into
0.01%:  I'm having a hard time t
0.01%:  there's like ten d
0.01%:  it's more like now
0.01%:  we live in the real
0.01%:  it's like the two words
0.01%:  we wrote that down
0.01%:  this isn't worth
0.01%:  the latter is kinda
0.01%:  it's this song I made where
0.01%:  what I've said here doesn't make me
0.01%:  it's this video game I wrote
0.01%:  it's this video game I wrote called
0.01%:  it's all mess
0.01%:  I'd love to see which
0.01%:  he's worse
0.01%:  that doesn't seem like it'll
0.01%:  we think we solved
0.01%:  I'm told this
0.01%:  what's weird is that I'd
0.01%:  I've still got the same
0.01%:  what it's made is him
0.01%:  it calls him the
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd still
0.01%:  it's making me wish we'd still have
0.01%:  I'm the one who gets
0.02%:  I'm the one who gets credit
0.01%:  that killed
0.01%:  it's the logic
0.01%:  I've said these words like
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree it's less
0.01%:  what he did was more like solved
0.01%:  it's more like math with
0.01%:  he did it on
0.01%:  I've no idea what that'
0.02%:  I've no idea what that's like
0.01%:  now that we live
0.01%:  it's more like what he does
0.01%:  this song came to me while I was review
0.01%:  he's dead now so it's weird that we still
0.01%:  it's more like he'll show
0.01%:  it's more like he's still a
0.01%:  we think that was
0.01%:  wow I'm kinda
0.01%:  all it did was get him named
0.01%:  this isn't so
0.01%:  it's a little weird how sem
0.01%:  that's how I'd like to die
0.01%:  it's like the two have
0.01%:  it's like the two have merged
0.01%:  this is more like the second
0.01%:  I've added the whole last
0.01%:  I made this rh
0.01%:  doesn't work with
0.01%:  it also makes him the world
0.01%:  he worked on his
0.01%:  all I did was move the word
0.01%:  he's still alive so I don't get
0.01%:  he's still alive so I don't get where
0.01%:  it's more like he showed it
0.01%:  it's more like he showed it'
0.01%:  there's a lot to
0.01%:  it seems this
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this solved
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we'd like the
0.01%:  this is so awesome
0.01%:  this is so awesome I might
0.01%:  we'd still love
0.01%:  we'd still love to hear what
0.01%:  that's the wrong case
0.01%:  that was like twelve
0.01%:  that was like twelve words
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in last week!! I was
0.01%:  I'd like to give the award this
0.01%:  this'll never
0.01%:  he's still living so we
0.01%:  I'm making this thesis
0.01%:  there was a time
0.01%:  this is wrong; I'
0.01%:  I can't make him
0.01%:  the last line might've come
0.01%:  it's more like he gets his own
0.01%:  it's the latter; I
0.01%:  it's the latter; I'
0.01%:  it's the latter; I'm making
0.01%:  it's more like I'm doing this
0.01%:  his weight
0.01%:  it's worth a lot
0.01%:  wait that second
0.01%:  I think it's more the case
0.01%:  I might've had
0.01%:  we call him the modern
0.01%:  I still think he's awesome!!
0.01%:  all I did was make the words
0.01%:  that's all I've got in this
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd all
0.01%:  wait no he
0.01%:  all this makes him
0.01%:  it's the whole reason we
0.01%:  what we're doing is called the
0.01%:  all it's done is make him a
0.01%:  these are his two
0.01%:  these are his two middle
0.01%:  it's a term he came
0.01%:  no wait this makes
0.01%:  all he did was give that
0.01%:  it's kinda lame how
0.01%:  I think there's two sem
0.01%:  he shares
0.01%:  he was still a
0.01%:  he was still a grad
0.01%:  I think it's agreed
0.01%:  that's like the word
0.01%:  we call them hard
0.01%:  he doesn't cover
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's all over
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad it's all over with
0.01%:  it's called the model
0.01%:  all I did there was make him
0.01%:  this is the new world
0.01%:  when I'm older
0.01%:  it's made him the last
0.01%:  it's made him the last living
0.01%:  he never did ask me
0.01%:  it's do
0.01%:  I wrote that in 
0.01%:  don't ask me how that
0.01%:  he's still alive; I did
0.01%:  I think he loves
0.01%:  it's more like he's doing what
0.01%:  we don't call it god
0.01%:  I think this verse was
0.01%:  this is all met
0.01%:  it's still not clear what
0.01%:  no wait he's called
0.01%:  it's words
0.01%:  I've heard it makes
0.01%:  this was made worse
0.01%:  there's no claims
0.01%:  this is more the
0.01%:  it was more like he showed
0.01%:  that's what made me
0.01%:  that's what made me decide
0.01%:  that's what made me write
0.01%:  we're well
0.01%:  I'm still not clear how
0.01%:  this is where we leave
0.01%:  it's a weird thing he came
0.01%:  his work made the
0.01%:  we all know who gets
0.03%:  we all know who gets credit
0.01%:  I'm glad we're done with it
0.01%:  that's a worse
0.01%:  this is all making me re
0.01%:  I gave him the second
0.01%:  there's a video game called this now
0.01%:  it's kinda mis
0.01%:  I'd never talked
0.01%:  writes his
0.01%:  it's like the world has gone mad
0.01%:  that's making me wish
0.01%:  it's a verse
0.01%:  I wrote that song
0.02%:  I wrote that song while
0.01%:  I think there's laws
0.01%:  now that we've agreed this
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's clear he
0.01%:  that gives me a new
0.01%:  I wrote that while in
0.01%:  give him the award now
0.01%:  all he did was write code
0.01%:  I never get this
0.01%:  I lie;
0.01%:  he solved it with
0.01%:  I think there's still time
0.01%:  what's weird is that it
0.01%:  what's weird is that it's called
0.01%:  no I'd like
0.01%:  I think there's at
0.01%:  that's weird that I'
0.01%:  that's weird that I'm doing
0.01%:  it's like the world's oldest math
0.01%:  how is this even
0.01%:  it was me who did all
0.01%:  it was me who did all the
0.01%:  all he wrote is
0.01%:  it's a title he
0.01%:  it's a title he gave
0.01%:  I wrote this down while st
0.01%:  I'd like to give the rest
0.01%:  it's messed with
0.01%:  still kinda
0.01%:  he's still alive; I got the
0.01%:  the world has moved
0.01%:  I made his sem
0.01%:  I think he'd made it
0.01%:  the world we live in is chaos
0.01%:  it's this video game I made with
0.01%:  I've had a
0.01%:  it's the latter so
0.01%:  I think he's still awesome
0.01%:  I'm making these two
0.01%:  that'd make him a god
0.01%:  all he did was give two
0.01%:  all I did was mess with the title
0.01%:  I read his w
0.01%:  I can't read this with
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is live
0.01%:  it was like a sem
0.01%:  what he said was like
0.01%:  what I did there was list
0.01%:  this is the world we don
0.01%:  that was how
0.01%:  it seems like he's more well
0.01%:  it's made him a leader
0.01%:  it's more like an ac
0.01%:  it's this video game where I
0.01%:  it's more he liked
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree that is
0.01%:  all I did was read some
0.01%:  the latter was his middle
0.01%:  this is like the world I
0.01%:  that's me who did
0.01%:  she didn
0.01%:  I might've dreamt this
0.01%:  that's a lie he's dead
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is sl
0.01%:  that is how we
0.01%:  it's the old
0.01%:  that's cooked
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well while
0.01%:  it's still hard to make
0.01%:  I can't tell who
0.01%:  I can't tell who's more
0.01%:  I don't see how this gives
0.01%:  the song is like
0.01%:  we've no idea who the
0.01%:  here in
0.01%:  all I've heard
0.01%:  it won
0.01%:  it won him
0.01%:  it won him the
0.01%:  that's a little weird and I've
0.01%:  he's still alive; he asked
0.02%:  he's still alive; he asked me to write
0.01%:  all it did was get him some sweet
0.01%:  this is where I take
0.01%:  this song will make
0.01%:  it doesn't work as well with me as
0.01%:  wow it
0.01%:  that's all I've got; his
0.01%:  wait that made
0.01%:  it's kinda weird we have
0.01%:  let's ignore what
0.01%:  let's ignore what I said
0.01%:  wow what
0.01%:  wow what the
0.01%:  it's more like a dis
0.01%:  I've read it and it's like
0.01%:  I've grown to like the
0.01%:  that's still weird even with
0.01%:  it's more like he's a giant
0.01%:  it's weird what
0.01%:  it's more like them
0.01%:  it's me who did the sem
0.01%:  it's all a dream
0.01%:  all he did was sit there
0.01%:  when did I get this
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this little window
0.01%:  we've all agreed that we like this
0.01%:  it's a e
0.01%:  it's hard to make a
0.01%:  what's weird is that I've made
0.01%:  we might as well admit this
0.01%:  I added that line
0.01%:  what it did was give the name
0.01%:  it's a little like
0.01%:  I've got no idea what he's made
0.01%:  I kinda wish these
0.02%:  I kinda wish these were
0.01%:  these last two were
0.01%:  how are
0.01%:  we've still gotta work
0.01%:  what I've done here is like
0.01%:  it's this close
0.01%:  he's still alive; I'm wrong
0.01%:  I've no idea how well liked
0.01%:  this is where we've landed
0.01%:  it's not like he's made him
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child who went
0.01%:  it has kind
0.01%:  I'm a little sad this
0.11%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we'
0.07%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we've
0.13%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we've come
0.05%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we've made
0.01%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we now
0.01%:  I'm a little sad this is the world we've gone
0.01%:  I'm a little sad this is where
0.12%:  I'm a little sad this is where we've come
0.03%:  I'm a little sad this is where we've landed
0.03%:  I'm a little sad this is where we ended
0.02%:  I'm a little sad this is where we've gone
0.01%:  I'm a little sad this is where we've got
0.01%:  it's like the world we'
0.01%:  all he ever did was design
0.01%:  he's still alive!! I made
0.01%:  what's this word
0.01%:  it's not clear we'd have
0.01%:  let's stick with his real
0.01%:  this is sad
0.01%:  I like it more with
0.01%:  it's more like the names
0.01%:  that's a little weak
0.01%:  what I'm doing is read this
0.01%:  this is a thing I've come
0.01%:  this is like when
0.01%:  this doesn't go well with rice
0.01%:  he's still alive; he wrote some
0.01%:  I'm still sort
0.01%:  he has like twelve
0.01%:  it's hard to tell who we've named
0.01%:  all I've done is merge
0.01%:  it's given him a whole lot
0.01%:  it's all those words
0.01%:  it's still me who gets the
0.01%:  this makes me wish I'd tried
0.01%:  that's given
0.01%:  it's called the two
0.01%:  this whole song
0.01%:  he's more know
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which we make
0.01%:  this is all wrong; I've made it
0.01%:  this is the world we moved
0.01%:  that's a good nick
0.01%:  I think we're all mess
0.01%:  I think we've lost a
0.01%:  I've still got to read
0.01%:  I've still got to read his
0.01%:  it's making the word
0.01%:  that last line made me like
0.01%:  this might've worked in
0.01%:  it's weird that I'd know this
0.01%:  it's more like he's done a
0.01%:  he's still alive and a
0.01%:  it's weird how he named
0.01%:  it's more like the title was added
0.01%:  it's him right
0.01%:  that makes me cringe!!
0.01%:  we've had this idea
0.01%:  that's not how I
0.01%:  I write this with
0.01%:  wait I think there was
0.01%:  I took
0.01%:  I had to remove
0.01%:  I've done it
0.01%:  it's more like he can
0.01%:  it's more like he can't solve
0.01%:  I'll admit these
0.01%:  it's made him a tow
0.01%:  it's still not clear who
0.01%:  these last two lines are made
0.01%:  I'll have to ask
0.01%:  I mist
0.01%:  I'd never come
0.01%:  he died in real
0.01%:  I've added all these things
0.01%:  I've made it worse with these
0.01%:  all this makes me cr
0.01%:  we've all heard that
0.01%:  i don
0.01%:  i don't have
0.01%:  this makes it hard
0.01%:  we're all good with that
0.01%:  this is what I like
0.01%:  that's a weird thing to decide
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like that weird
0.01%:  that's the world we lived in!!
0.01%:  that was the world we lived in weeks
0.01%:  now that I've called
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he made
0.01%:  it's hard to tell what we've come
0.01%:  this is me having
0.01%:  what I've said there is lies
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well as it seemed
0.01%:  it's more like a middle child that got
0.01%:  while we're at it I'll get
0.01%:  it's hard to tell '
0.01%:  this is the worst it
0.01%:  this is making me real sad
0.01%:  I still don't get what's hard
0.01%:  wow that's a great
0.01%:  this seems to have made
0.01%:  that was his real
0.01%:  that was his real middle
0.01%:  we've all kinda agreed to switch
0.01%:  we've called this the
0.01%:  it's the letter
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what's awesome
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; we came
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last time I asked
0.01%:  the latter was added in
0.01%:  he's still alive I'd
0.01%:  it's the second I've read
0.01%:  I think it was made him
0.01%:  the direct
0.01%:  don't read his sem
0.01%:  I might've missed a little
0.01%:  the movie's still
0.01%:  it's a term given
0.01%:  wait I never said
0.01%:  it's weird that he came
0.01%:  it's clear he liked
0.01%:  that's a secret
0.01%:  we're less
0.01%:  that's legal advice
0.01%:  we all agree with
0.01%:  it's made him get the
0.01%:  this has made me decide to
0.01%:  we all know he'd
0.01%:  I think he got a
0.01%:  it's more like he's the go
0.01%:  I've heard he's dead
0.01%:  it's like the words
0.01%:  it's named with the word
0.01%:  we never call him the
0.01%:  I can't write this with
0.01%:  I've called him the latter
0.01%:  it's his third
0.01%:  that's like a direct
0.01%:  that's wrong he died
0.01%:  I'm new to this game
0.01%:  I'm making it worse with the
0.01%:  this song works with
0.01%:  it was like a whole thing
0.01%:  sir I have
0.01%:  he did the work well
0.01%:  the world we live in is sad
0.01%:  wait I've made this whole
0.01%:  now that we've all agreed to
0.01%:  that's more like what's called
0.01%:  let's leave that
0.01%:  it's got more like
0.01%:  the closer
0.01%:  I will never admit
0.01%:  I'm re
0.01%:  I think it's more he was
0.01%:  that's wrong; he came
0.01%:  he died over the
0.01%:  we're all gods now
0.01%:  he wins the award
0.01%:  I'd rate it like
0.01%:  what I did there made
0.01%:  what he's done is create
0.01%:  I've made no
0.01%:  since there's a
0.01%:  I'd love to see that
0.01%:  it's this movie
0.01%:  it's this movie where
0.01%:  it's this movie called
0.01%:  what I did there was close
0.01%:  right now he'd
0.01%:  it's hard to decide with
0.01%:  that's not how I'
0.01%:  that's not how I'd write
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell who'd
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's the most
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's give this
0.01%:  it's making me wish that we were
0.01%:  it's like he never
0.01%:  wait that doesn't work I
0.01%:  I'll leave it with
0.01%:  it makes me wish I'd gone to law
0.01%:  I'm done with these
0.01%:  it's how I
0.01%:  I'm glad we have this time to work
0.01%:  he denied the
0.01%:  that doesn't work at all;
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd lived
0.01%:  it's his kids
0.01%:  it's his kids who get
0.01%:  it's kinda great how we've come
0.01%:  it seems he liked
0.01%:  the title has
0.01%:  all he did there was give me
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how come
0.01%:  what it's called is '
0.01%:  remove
0.01%:  that's weird since he's alive
0.01%:  we gave it the
0.01%:  this is the world we leave
0.01%:  I'm c
0.01%:  the case
0.01%:  that died
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he wrote
0.01%:  I'd call his
0.01%:  I'd call his work
0.01%:  I think it's weird that we give
0.01%:  it's making me wish that we'
0.01%:  it's making me wish that we'd solved
0.01%:  there's a two
0.01%:  I've had this window
0.01%:  I've got no idea where that was
0.01%:  it's still the word
0.01%:  we've had the same
0.01%:  I've no idea who might
0.01%:  it's what got him made
0.01%:  we've all taken
0.01%:  with his
0.01%:  it's weird that all
0.01%:  I wrote this down the
0.01%:  I made him write this down
0.01%:  I'd like to have it
0.01%:  that's all the verse
0.01%:  it's weird that he made
0.01%:  I've made these claims
0.01%:  we've named a
0.01%:  it's kinda racist how
0.01%:  it's kinda racist how we
0.01%:  I think it's called that
0.01%: ; it was
0.01%:  he's done more
0.01%:  he's still alive; I'm good
0.01%:  who cares it's the
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's give him a new
0.01%:  he's still alive; this was
0.01%:  that seems like it's a
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how he seems
0.01%:  we've all agreed the title
0.01%:  I think it's a review
0.01%:  I'm moving
0.01%:  I don't recall what he said
0.01%:  we were doing that
0.01%:  it was me who called him a
0.01%:  it's hard to see how it's made
0.01%:  we don't ever call him the
0.01%:  I wonder what his
0.01%:  I wonder what his middle
0.01%:  all I did was write down his
0.01%:  I've made him the origin
0.01%:  that degree
0.01%:  we named him this
0.01%:  we still have to get
0.01%:  that's still where I'
0.01%:  that's still where I'm coming
0.01%:  we think he missed
0.01%:  he's more math
0.01%:  I think it's clear we've missed
0.01%:  I'll let him do
0.01%:  this is where I'd like to add
0.01%:  he never said I
0.01%:  it's making me wish I'd tried to solve
0.01%:  now that I've said it it seems like he
0.01%:  now that I've said it it seems like he's more
0.01%:  now that I've said it it seems like he'd
0.01%:  he's made me write this down
0.01%:  it's made him a single
0.01%:  I was making shit
0.01%:  it's more like a long
0.01%:  I think the idea is
0.01%:  I never did like his
0.01%:  I messed those
0.01%:  that's making him two
0.01%:  this is so awesome I might write
0.01%:  that made me sick inside
0.01%:  he's a little more like
0.01%:  the title is wrong
0.01%:  all the words in
0.01%:  what I get
0.01%:  I think we've made more
0.01%:  that made him less
0.01%:  I've lost it here
0.01%:  how did I write this
0.01%:  what he did was write down 
0.01%:  I'm glad we sorted this all
0.01%:  all I did was merge his
0.01%:  what he did was write down some sem
0.01%:  it's weird how that's all
0.01%:  it gave him his name
0.01%:  it's more like he was so
0.01%:  where did he come
0.01%:  there's limits to what we
0.01%:  it's kinda gross how he'
0.01%:  it's a crime to even
0.01%:  it's more like what I've done with
0.01%:  I'd like to write a song called
0.01%:  I think we got this
0.01%:  I did this whole time
0.01%:  I think we've made some slight
0.01%:  we think he got
0.01%:  he's still in charge
0.01%:  I'll make it
0.01%:  it was the god
0.01%:  it's the title I'm making
0.01%:  I'll admit this was the worst
0.01%:  he's real sick
0.01%:  I lied; he never asked
0.01%:  made him the world
0.01%:  all I know is that the
0.01%:  he was almost
0.03%:  he was almost killed
0.01%:  I lied; it's the world we'
0.01%:  this isn't what we agreed
0.01%:  I don't like how this all
0.01%:  I don't like how this all came
0.01%:  it's a little weird how we've named the
0.01%:  I don't see how we'll ever decide that
0.01%:  no wait he's the
0.01%:  I can't talk
0.01%:  I can't talk right
0.01%:  we've all agreed that it's not
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we'd
0.02%:  it doesn't seem like we'd have
0.01%:  it's made the whole
0.01%:  it's a whole new world
0.01%:  I think we agree this
0.01%:  let's give that
0.01%:  I know what the
0.01%:  I'm glad we had this talk '
0.01%:  he's like the one
0.01%:  I've made him this one
0.01%:  now that I've said it he'd
0.01%:  I lied; that's the world
0.04%:  I lied; that's the world we live
0.01%:  it's still a secret how he knew
0.01%:  it was like twelve other things
0.01%:  I might have added a little
0.01%:  what did he like
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that's how we got
0.01%:  I give him the
0.02%:  I give him the credit
0.01%:  the world is still the same; I was
0.01%:  he's still alive; we might
0.01%:  the latter is called
0.01%:  all I've said is wrong
0.01%:  I'll admit he's more the
0.01%:  I don't read him
0.01%:  this has got me kinda
0.01%:  we think that's more
0.01%:  while we're at it I've made some
0.01%:  while we're at it I've made some slight
0.01%:  I don't agree with all the
0.01%:  I don't see how it's like
0.01%:  I kinda wish there's
0.01%:  I'll go write
0.01%:  there's a lot we can
0.01%:  it's made him do that
0.01%:  wait how did this
0.01%:  wait how did this get
0.01%:  who cares I'm making
0.01%:  I did some math
0.01%:  it doesn't make him his dad
0.01%:  isn't he called
0.01%:  I'm aware this makes
0.01%:  I've killed
0.01%:  we've all agreed that's like
0.01%:  it never was called
0.01%:  I kinda wish we lived where
0.01%:  what it did was he
0.01%:  he's still doing this
0.01%:  he's still doing this work
0.01%:  what I've come
0.01%:  I lied; that's what
0.01%:  I'd still like to see what'
0.01%:  I think it's some other
0.01%:  I've set
0.01%:  that was wrong; he
0.01%:  it's kinda sweet how we've made him
0.01%:  all I've done is take his
0.01%:  while we're at it I'm glad
0.01%:  it's more what he didn
0.01%:  I know this is a
0.01%:  he's still alive and worked as
0.01%:  I've made it worse now
0.01%:  we got here
0.01%:  it's more like these things
0.01%:  he did have some
0.01%:  I've made him the latter!!
0.01%:  it's weird how he's not called
0.01%:  I don't get his
0.01%:  it's the world we live in a
0.01%:  the last line works
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he's like
0.01%:  he's still alive and more
0.01%:  this was the world we lived in last week so
0.01%:  it's more a child
0.01%:  this is making me all
0.01%:  he's a little more active
0.01%:  I've got no idea what this is called
0.01%:  while we're at it I might as well note
0.01%:  he's worked since
0.01%:  I lied; that's the world we'
0.01%:  it's all kinda mess
0.01%:  I'll leave the word
0.01%:  it's all sorts
0.01%:  it's more like he's had one
0.01%:  we've tried to make
0.01%:  we've tried to make him
0.01%:  all that's the
0.01%:  it's more like he's hiding
0.01%:  that's what we were called
0.01%:  it doesn't have made him like
0.01%:  I've listed them
0.01%:  I saw his
0.01%:  this'll take
0.01%:  I'd watch that movie like
0.01%:  I care
0.01%:  I'll give it to him either
0.01%:  that's kinda more
0.01%:  what I've said is the worst
0.01%:  dear
0.01%:  what it's done is made him go
0.01%:  there's a gold
0.01%:  it's like the third cool
0.01%:  when he came
0.01%:  I asked him this
0.01%:  wait that's the world we've
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; who
0.01%:  the great
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work well with a
0.01%:  it's like the most racist
0.01%:  I've read his whole
0.01%:  it's made him things
0.01%:  it doesn't have the words '
0.01%:  it's called lots
0.01%:  that link
0.01%:  I think it's weird he gets
0.02%:  I think it's weird he gets called
0.01%:  I think it's weird he gets called a
0.01%:  I think it's me who wrote
0.01%:  it's more like he's with
0.01%:  there's a slight cave
0.01%:  it's the older
0.01%:  it's more what the
0.01%:  I think we'd all agreed to switch
0.01%:  I don't see how we're alive
0.01%:  we'd have to wait
0.01%:  it does seem like he
0.01%:  it does seem like he was
0.01%:  I kinda dig this whole
0.01%:  we still have to decide what we're eating
0.01%:  when he was asked
0.01%:  he was asked the
0.01%:  there's a medal called
0.01%:  it's kinda hard to tell what comes
0.01%:  it's eating
0.01%:  it's his thesis work
0.01%:  wait!! I'
0.01%:  I read this while making
0.01%:  the answer's still
0.01%:  I'm glad we're done with these
0.01%:  I'd like him to get
0.01%:  it's a che
0.01%:  we've had this award
0.01%:  we've had this award since
0.01%:  it's more social
0.01%:  he's still alive!! I'm making
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's re
0.01%:  doesn't he work
0.01%:  it's more his dad who
0.01%:  he called it his
0.01%:  don't ask me where the
0.01%:  he gave it a more
0.01%:  it was done
0.01%:  I'd like to give this award to the
0.01%:  that doesn't work as well;
0.01%:  it's like I'm having
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we've made a
0.01%:  that line rh
0.01%:  while we're at it I'd like to am
0.01%:  he'll get the award in
0.01%:  this doesn't go with
0.01%:  his kids were named '
0.01%:  it's two things
0.01%:  we're asking him
0.01%:  his work is what led me
0.01%:  it's like second
0.01%:  all this made
0.01%:  all this made him
0.01%:  I added most
0.01%:  I did it over
0.01%:  there's a tie
0.01%:  there's a tie with
0.01%:  it's more like he's wanted
0.01%:  it's what it's called when I
0.01%:  it's the dis

0.01%:  his hair
0.01%:  it doesn't work with the middle
0.01%:  we call him what
0.01%:  I still like it when he gives me a
0.01%:  that's easier
0.01%:  that's also
0.01%:  I've made no claims
0.01%:  it was more me
0.01%:  it was more me who
0.01%:  I'll write the song
0.01%:  I think we've missed what
0.01%:  let's work
0.01%:  I've called him a
0.01%:  it doesn't make him as
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; it
0.01%:  it's the world we lived in last week; it was
0.01%:  we have to call the
0.01%:  it's more like a ch
0.01%:  it's hard to know what we'll decide
0.01%:  what it's done is create
0.01%:  he's still alive and wrote a
0.01%:  that's what I'd call it
0.01%:  I don't live
0.01%:  I don't live here
0.01%:  while we're at it I've also made
0.01%:  it's like he's more
0.01%:  I'd like to change the last
0.01%:  I'd like to change the last word
0.01%:  I've got work
0.01%:  while we're at it we might as well do it
0.01%:  I think he agrees
0.01%:  it's c
0.01%:  it's still kinda awesome
0.01%:  when he wrote it I
0.01%:  the world we live in is locked
0.01%:  that's kinda how I've
0.01%:  I wish he'd died
0.01%:  what I wrote down is
0.01%:  when I read that it
0.01%:  when I read that it made
0.01%:  when I read that it made me sick
0.01%:  I don't recall who the
0.01%:  no it's more like he's made
0.01%:  I wonder what he'd make
0.01%:  it reads like he was
0.01%:  it's the same name
0.01%:  he doesn't make it
0.01%:  I'm glad to have
0.01%:  I might've added more
0.01%:  he did all the work and I'
0.01%:  let's avoid the
0.01%:  he died last week so we'll have to wait
0.01%:  I think the movie's called '
0.01%:  that's like the worst middle
0.01%:  he died last week so never
0.01%:  what he did was never
0.01%:  I'd call them more like the
0.01%:  it's more like he's at least
0.01%:  it's what gives
0.01%:  I kinda did it
0.01%:  we're doing well with that
0.01%:  what he did was cook
0.01%:  that line works with
0.01%:  it's che
0.01%:  I'd still like to see him answer
0.01%:  it's god'
0.01%:  what I'm doing here is sm
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad this is the world we got
0.01%:  I liked it more when he said
0.01%:  I'd like to visit
0.01%:  it's still mat
0.01%:  we still know him
0.01%:  this is ter
0.01%:  wow that's like the most
0.01%:  wait it's the wrong
0.01%:  it was me who's the
0.01%:  that's more like how it
0.01%:  the whole time I'm
0.01%:  it's more like he did a sem
0.01%:  it's more like a w
0.01%:  it's all I've read this week!!
0.01%:  I've killed the
0.01%:  while we're at it might as well set
0.01%:  it was more like what
0.01%:  it's more like ded
0.01%:  that was the middle
0.01%:  this might not make
0.01%:  it's more like when his
0.01%:  it's hard to tell;
0.01%:  it's more like which
0.01%:  that is me
0.01%:  this is the world we live in; I'm glad
0.01%:  it's made him a grand
0.01%:  it was his dad'
0.01%:  I think we're called the
0.01%:  we'd all like to hear
0.01%:  what it's done is give him a well
0.01%:  he's kinda good
0.01%:  the second time I said
0.01%:  he'd like it more
0.01%:  he did it three
0.01%:  this is making me sad so I've
0.01%:  there's this middle
0.01%:  I read it while st
0.01%:  wait did I get
0.01%:  what I'd like to do is write the
0.01%:  the second makes him a
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad that we've
0.01%:  it's like his least
0.01%:  now that I've read it it seems like he'd
0.01%:  I think we'll have to credit
0.01%:  he's dead now; the
0.01%:  I think he's said it
0.01%:  I think he's said it's more
0.01%:  I don't get what this
0.01%:  I've added some things here
0.01%:  it's given him a sweet
0.01%:  we know he's dead
0.01%:  it's said his work
0.01%:  this doesn't make me sad
0.01%:  that's weird and I'd
0.02%:  that's weird and I'd like
0.01%:  that's weird and I'd like to go
0.01%:  don't ask me where I've
0.01%:  I don't see where that came
0.01%:  I think it's the weird
0.01%:  we call it hard

0.01%:  that makes me wish we still
0.03%:  that makes me wish we still lived
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad we solved these
0.01%:  he later came
0.01%:  while that's a great
0.01%:  it's this long
0.01%:  he's still alive; I was wrong
0.01%:  that last line comes
0.01%:  I think it's still the
0.01%:  I think it's still the same
0.01%:  I'm sad this
0.05%:  I'm sad this is the world we live in!!
0.02%:  I'm sad this is the world we live in;
0.02%:  I'm sad this is the world we'

0.01%:  I'm sad this is the world we've
0.01%:  I'm sad this is the world we've made
0.01%:  I'm sad this is the world we've come

0.01%:  we got the idea
0.01%:  I'll ask
0.01%:  I'll ask him to write
0.01%:  this doesn't seem like it'll ever
0.01%:  I still don't see how we
0.01%:  it's more like he ended
0.01%:  while I'm thank
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he came
0.01%:  that's some racist
0.01%:  I think he was 
0.01%:  he's got some weird views
0.01%:  this real
0.01%:  I don't see how he's ever called
0.01%:  that's a little weird how we've
0.01%:  we were at
0.01%:  it seems like he wasn
0.01%:  it's his work on the time
0.01%:  what I'd like to write
0.01%:  I wrote this song like a
0.01%:  I wrote this song like a decade
0.01%:  I'll leave the rh
0.01%:  that's while we
0.02%:  that's while we're still
0.01%:  that's while we're living
0.01%:  let's make it clear
0.01%:  he's cooked
0.01%:  it's how he's come
0.01%:  I wrote that this
0.01%:  I wrote that this week
0.01%:  now that I've said it twice
0.01%:  we live in the world that
0.01%:  what I've said here is now
0.01%:  I might've talked
0.01%:  it's hard to make this seem
0.01%:  I think we have to call
0.01%:  I think he's more so called
0.01%:  this reads like I've
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like he's heard
0.01%:  this is what it's called now
0.01%:  the last line is me
0.01%:  all it did was get him ten
0.01%:  we live in the world I'
0.01%:  it's even older
0.01%:  it's the latter like
0.01%:  it's more like he's the last
0.01%:  all I was doing
0.01%:  that's what's called
0.01%:  what he did was design clever
0.01%:  this is still awesome
0.01%:  it's weird that he got
0.01%:  right now he's at
0.01%:  I'll leave it to the
0.01%:  I had a stroke when
0.01%:  it's hard to decide what I'm most
0.01%:  I've got no idea what was
0.01%:  I'd like to see how hard
0.01%:  I'm done with this idea
0.01%:  there's like a sem
0.01%:  it's more like he got this
0.01%:  that leaves me
0.01%:  that leaves me with like
0.01%:  that leaves me with some
0.01%:  we're doing this the
0.01%:  we've had a whole
0.01%:  it's more like he's the man
0.01%:  what he did was settle
0.01%:  that last line makes me c
0.01%:  I might have wreck
0.01%:  wait I think the word
0.01%:  it's more like he is the god
0.01%:  there's two whole
0.01%:  we've heard this song like
0.01%:  I'd love a
0.01%:  it's what he does
0.01%:  it's making me sad how weird
0.01%:  the class
0.01%:  it's more like he was living
0.01%:  I think we all agree we
0.01%:  all he did was give credit to the
0.01%:  there's this video game we made
0.01%:  that's a tragic
0.01%:  it gives him the award
0.01%:  what we've got here is two
0.01%:  this doesn't work that well!!
0.01%:  we might want to stick
0.01%:  it's great he
0.01%:  when I was twelve
0.01%:  those last two lines were a
0.01%:  I wonder what'
0.01%:  ever since he'
0.01%:  it's more like that last
0.01%:  we still have to decide what's wrong
0.01%:  he hadn
0.01%:  this is him
0.01%:  it's more like he gave his name
0.01%:  all I did was throw the
0.01%:  it's what made him decide to work
0.01%:  we all owe this
0.01%:  I lied; he's made
0.01%:  we'll give him the entire
0.01%:  that's where I know
0.01%:  that's his sister
0.01%:  he died over 
0.01%:  it's a decade
0.01%:  I now

0.01%:  I think it screw
0.01%:  he might've said it was called
0.01%:  no wait I screw
0.01%:  this is kinda mess
0.01%:  it's like I've
0.01%:  it's called it
0.01%:  don't ask me where I came
0.01%:  this is making me decide I
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how the most
0.01%:  it's still awesome even
0.01%:  I've made him that too
0.01%:  that's like their middle names
0.01%:  what am I doing this
0.01%:  I've lied the
0.06%:  I've lied the whole time and
0.01%:  I've lied the whole time;
0.01%:  I've lied the entire
0.01%:  what I did there was legit
0.01%:  I've added those lines
0.01%:  he wrote it with two
0.01%:  it's a real thing we
0.01%:  it's kinda weird how all the sem
0.01%:  we're not 
0.01%:  this is the worst idea I'm

0.01%:  this work is called
0.01%:  what I've said in
0.01%:  what I've said in this
0.01%:  we'll never get this
0.01%:  what he did was rig
0.01%:  it's like the origin
0.01%:  what's worse is that I'm making
0.01%:  what was it
0.01%:  that's weird since he was
0.01%:  he died last week so that
0.07%:  he died last week so that's weird
0.01%:  it's where we all
0.01%:  it was his middle
0.01%:  this will make him a
0.01%:  I can't give him that
0.01%:  that was more him
0.01%:  this song was called
0.01%:  with the last
0.01%:  this is the world we lived in as
0.01%:  this is the world we need

0.01%:  now it's more like he's made
0.01%:  we tried to give him this
0.01%:  it's kinda weird that he's alive
0.01%:  all he did was write things like
0.01%:  it's weird that we even
0.01%:  it's weird that we even call
0.01%:  it's weird that we even call him
0.01%:  these things are still
0.01%:  it's more me who thinks
0.01%:  I think he'll die
0.01%:  the latter isn
0.01%:  it's me who's the most
0.01%:  I think we were the
0.01%:  his thesis was never
0.01%:  has made him like
0.01%:  that's the worst sl
0.01%:  that's how it goes in
0.01%:  he's real cool
0.01%:  I'd have to go
0.01%:  I'd have to go with
0.01%:  he wrote down this
0.01%:  the link'
0.01%:  I might need to review that
0.01%:  that's the worst line I've made
0.01%:  wait this has
0.01%:  I think it's three
0.01%:  I don't get this either
0.01%:  it's a little weird how he gives
0.01%:  it's like a thing called the
0.01%:  he calls this
0.01%:  I've added the lines
0.01%:  what he did was write an
0.01%:  dis
0.01%:  I think we missed it
0.01%:  it's more like he's given a sem
0.01%:  wait how did this even
0.01%:  we've agreed to call this the
0.01%:  it's the worst thing I've said all week so
0.01%:  I kinda hated
0.01%:  it's more like he's now the
0.01%:  wait that doesn't work as
0.01%:  we'll stick with the old
0.01%:  the world's gone mad
0.01%:  let's get him his
0.01%:  we've all agreed this is kind
0.01%:  he's dead now; he'
0.01%:  it's so weird having
0.01%:  it makes him the less
0.01%:  I might still have some work
0.01%:  while we're at it this song'
0.02%:  while we're at it this song's called
0.01%:  it's more like he was active
0.01%:  wait I've read this
0.01%:  we've had a while
0.01%:  we've had a while to work
0.01%:  we've had a while to get
0.01%:  that's kinda what we
0.01%:  that's kinda what we were
0.01%:  it's him who got
0.01%:  I'm wrong this is a
0.01%:  I've made him that; it's in
0.01%:  he was right to
0.01%:  this is where we go
0.01%:  his dad is
0.01%:  that's more like his dad'
0.01%:  doc
0.01%:  it's more like it gave
0.01%:  it's more like it gave him the
0.01%:  ignore the
0.01%:  I've made it worse;
0.01%:  wait there's still some
0.01%:  he's kinda more well
0.01%:  we wanted
0.01%:  his work's a
0.01%:  his work's a little dated
0.01%:  his work's a little less
0.01%:  wait wait hold
0.01%:  it was more like how
0.01%:  it's made him head
0.01%:  this is all wrong; the
0.01%:  it's the latter; his
0.01%:  he's still alive so what
0.01%:  it's me who named
0.01%:  while we're at it let's also give me
0.01%:  I'd never liked
0.01%:  that's like all we
0.01%:  I think we've all made this world
0.01%:  that's the world we live in; I was
0.01%:  the word I want is '
0.01%:  now that we have
0.01%:  let's agree that
0.01%:  his master
0.01%:  it was called things like '
0.01%:  he's still alive so we don
0.01%:  he's still alive so we don't get
0.01%:  that doesn't work well with me
0.01%:  what I said was right
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how well
0.01%:  while we're at it let's stick
0.01%:  I've made it the world
0.01%:  that's still the case
0.01%:  what I've said is 
0.01%:  there I'm making this
0.01%:  it's still like the worst
0.01%:  I'll admit this makes
0.01%:  I think it's called sem
0.01%:  I think he's dead so we're still
0.01%:  I think there's some w
0.01%:  I think we missed what
0.01%:  that'd make it more
0.01%:  it's a genre
0.01%:  what's that smell
0.01%:  the names
0.01%:  that last verse might
0.01%:  I'm glad the
0.01%:  wait I think we missed a word
0.01%:  it's g
0.01%:  it's greek
0.01%:  kinda wish
0.01%:  it's like the worst thing we've all
0.01%:  now that I've said it it's clear how
0.01%:  take
0.01%:  I lied; he's one
0.01%:  it's a h
0.01%:  all I know is it
0.01%:  all I know is it's the
0.01%:  all I know is it's hard
0.01%:  all I know is it's where
0.01%:  I made him the god
0.01%:  that's how I'll write
0.01%:  it's him that's made
0.01%:  most agree
0.01%:  I'd never liked that
0.01%:  it was his older
0.01%:  I've made it the worst
0.01%:  we've all made him that;
0.01%:  he's kinda dead right
0.01%:  what it's made him is 
0.01%:  there's still a long
0.01%:  we call it a
0.01%:  I wrote these last
0.01%:  I missed the word limit
0.01%:  he's dead so it's more like I
0.01%:  come with me and
0.01%:  come with me and I'll give
0.01%:  come with me and I will
0.01%:  come with me and I will show
0.01%:  doesn't he have like

0.01%:  he never said he'
0.01%:  he never said he'd like
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad he's still
0.01%:  that's how I got
0.01%:  it's given him two
0.01%:  it's given him two awards
0.01%:  I'm glad we never had
0.01%:  I'm glad we never had this talk
0.01%:  it doesn't matter how he's called
0.01%:  wait did I screw
0.01%:  I did the last
0.01%:  he's alive and well;
0.01%:  I've said this twice in
0.01%:  it doesn't matter which;
0.01%:  it's more like he was a mid
0.01%:  this world is awesome
0.01%:  all I did was screw with
0.01%:  he wrote two
0.01%:  I think he also wrote
0.01%:  this is the most weird
0.01%:  he died last week so it's weird that
0.01%:  he died last week so it's weird that I'm even
0.01%:  he died last week so it's weird that I've
0.01%:  no he's more like a
0.01%:  it's the idea
0.01%:  I lied; that's a
0.01%:  the c
0.01%:  there isn't time
0.01%:  all I've done is make it
0.01%:  it's a sc
0.01%:  that's like weird
0.01%:  he's called things
0.01%:  I don't see where he talks
0.01%:  it's a second
0.01%:  that's the most awesome
0.01%:  it's making me a little sad!!
0.01%:  it's a god damn

0.01%:  I admit that
0.01%:  I admit that'
0.01%:  this is making me dro
0.01%:  I think we've all missed a
0.01%:  he likes it when I write
0.01%:  it's all this weird
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's give him an
0.01%:  I think we've sort
0.01%:  that's all him
0.01%:  it was that
0.01%:  now that we've read
0.01%:  as he
0.01%:  I think the last verse was
0.01%:  we call him the 'grand
0.01%:  I think we all agree he'd
0.01%:  that's with
0.01%:  he did it more with
0.01%:  I've come to terms with what'
0.01%:  I think we agreed this
0.01%:  I think there's a '
0.01%:  he's still alive h
0.01%:  we can still solve
0.01%:  I've got the head
0.01%:  it's weird that he's called like
0.01%:  I did that last
0.01%:  no that was
0.01%:  I think we've made it all
0.01%:  I think we cover
0.01%:  I think that gave
0.01%:  what I did there was look
0.01%:  what I like most
0.01%:  it's more like he's given them
0.01%:  this is all over
0.01%:  wait where'd he get
0.01%:  isn't that like
0.01%:  I never liked how
0.01%:  I'd like to see how well that
0.01%:  it was more this
0.01%:  that's racism
0.01%:  he's real good at math
0.01%:  the last two lines were added like
0.01%:  wait this doesn't work we
0.01%:  I'd like some credit
0.01%:  I don't get how he did
0.01%:  the latter is making
0.01%:  the latter is making him
0.01%:  gave
0.01%:  this is how it works
0.01%:  it's like his other
0.01%:  I might still need
0.01%:  he did get the award
0.01%:  it's the world we live in!! I
0.01%:  I kinda wish it was more
0.01%:  it's more he's a
0.01%:  I think it's a well
0.01%:  it was all made
0.01%:  what's weird is I don't have
0.01%:  he never made that claim
0.01%:  what it's done is make him get older
0.01%:  we've got a while
0.01%:  we lied
0.01%:  it's when he wrote it
0.01%:  it still seems weird
0.01%:  that does seem weird when
0.01%:  I can't see how it
0.01%:  I might have named it
0.01%:  that's a weird sem
0.01%:  it's not like he's ever said
0.01%:  there's this new kid
0.01%:  that's a lie; it's made
0.01%:  this is too
0.01%:  I'ma go home
0.01%:  I'm glad we solved this whole
0.01%:  we've agreed that we
0.01%:  we'll stick with that
0.01%:  he's still alive and the work'
0.01%:  it's where I got this
0.01%:  he asks
0.01%:  I admit the
0.01%:  he doesn't like how I called
0.01%:  it's more like he's the middle son
0.01%:  that last line is like
0.01%:  wait I'm done
0.01%:  wait I'm done with
0.01%:  that's hack
0.01%:  all I did was change the world
0.01%:  I can't read that
0.01%:  he doesn't like hard
0.01%:  it's a song called
0.01%:  there isn't a video
0.02%:  there isn't a video game called
0.01%:  it was other
0.01%:  it's kinda weird he's called a
0.01%:  that's all he ever talked
0.01%:  that seems weird so
0.01%:  that seems weird so I'll
0.01%:  I think we're less
0.01%:  it's the reason we give
0.01%:  I think we all missed the word
0.01%:  it was me who wrote that!!
0.01%:  we got there
0.01%:  I'd like to see him eat
0.01%:  hear
0.01%:  doesn't like it
0.01%:  it's a little weird he'd
0.01%:  he died two weeks ago;
0.00%:  all we've done is make
0.00%:  his middle name is the latter
0.00%:  I will never make
0.00%:  I had it wrong;
0.00%:  this was the world we lived in like two
0.00%:  he likes it more
0.00%:  I'm making this word salad
0.00%:  what I'd like right now is a little
0.00%:  I still think we'd
0.00%:  what it did was make him get ten
0.00%:  it's a thing we call
0.00%:  since we've all agreed to
0.00%:  I wish we still talked
0.00%:  now that I've listed him
0.00%:  that's the most clever
0.00%:  I think it's the world we all
0.00%:  we'll give him the award to
0.00%:  this is the worst news
0.00%:  we might have to add
0.00%:  I saw him give
0.00%:  it's kinda awesome that we
0.01%:  it's kinda awesome that we've
0.00%:  we all agreed the
0.00%:  it's a crime I
0.00%:  all he did was write 
0.00%:  it's making me sad that we're still
0.00%:  that's more like the least
0.00%:  all I know is that he did some
0.00%:  that might've read
0.00%:  wait that was me
0.00%:  let's call them
0.00%:  I've got the sem
0.00%:  it's weird to think how
0.00%:  in this world he's called
0.00%:  it's like the worst thing I've added
0.00%:  it's awesome how well
0.00%:  I've come to like this new
0.00%:  it doesn't have a whole
0.00%:  that was weird to
0.00%:  while we're living
0.00%:  it's called in
0.00%:  I get this whole
0.00%:  it's more like when he solved
0.00%:  we were all making
0.01%:  we were all making this
0.00%:  there's got
0.00%:  this was like the worst idea I
0.01%:  this was like the worst idea I've come
0.00%:  we'd still like some
0.00%:  I write these down while
0.00%:  he's still living; I'
0.00%:  I'm adding some
0.01%:  I'm adding some words
0.00%:  I wrote that while sc
0.00%:  I think it's made him a god
0.00%:  it's the latter we
0.00%:  it made him all the
0.00%:  he's still not
0.00%:  it's called t
0.00%:  it's where he said
0.00%:  that's wrong; he's still dead
0.00%:  I lied we live in the world we
0.00%:  what I've said here is called
0.00%:  I think we'll miss
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree it's made
0.00%:  that's all I've got there;
0.00%:  we'll give him the last one
0.00%:  let's all agree that we
0.01%:  let's all agree that we've
0.00%:  he got mad when I called it
0.00%:  it seems the
0.00%:  he's said he'
0.00%:  there he's listed
0.00%:  this seemed like a good idea when I was
0.00%:  this is all made worse
0.00%:  the thing I was
0.00%:  we don't give awards like this
0.00%:  the thing I've
0.01%:  the thing I've said
0.00%:  we cover
0.00%:  I might have kinda made it
0.00%:  while we're at it we'll give him
0.00%:  that doesn't work as well with less
0.00%:  that's how we write it down
0.00%:  it's more like he sc
0.00%:  I've made him this; it's a
0.00%:  wait this doesn't work I've mess
0.00%:  he was more like the son
0.00%:  it's a little long
0.00%:  I never said his sem
0.00%:  that song is weird
0.00%:  I might have cooked
0.00%:  it draws
0.00%:  I think we've all made it clear this
0.00%:  it's more his second
0.00%:  we'd all like him to come
0.00%:  I think he's still god
0.00%:  we'd still like to have
0.00%:  the line'
0.00%:  we'll have to add
0.00%:  I wrote his name
0.00%:  he's dead; the
0.00%:  I might've kinda made the
0.00%:  that name makes
0.00%:  it's kinda the weird
0.00%:  it's weird that I'm so
0.00%:  there's a shit
0.00%:  I tried making him
0.00%:  it's like the cr
0.00%:  while we're at it I'll admit
0.00%:  we're still asking him how
0.00%:  I'm asking him
0.00%:  it doesn't work with the sem
0.00%:  I'm seeing the
0.00%:  it's me who's asking the
0.00%:  I heard he got
0.00%:  he wrote this in
0.00%:  I think he's still alive so it
0.02%:  I think he's still alive so it's more
0.00%:  the second is his
0.00%:  let's avoid the whole
0.00%:  it's still what
0.00%:  I'll make him
0.00%:  there's like this song
0.00%:  I've called him wrong
0.00%:  it's more like he'd had
0.00%:  it's still kinda weird how we've got
0.00%:  this is the last time I'm doing
0.00%:  I have the words
0.00%:  we're doing this math
0.00%:  he kinda died last
0.00%:  that's weird since he died
0.00%:  I like all
0.01%:  I like all the words
0.00%:  all he did there was talk
0.00%:  I'm making those titles
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how little he
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little he gets
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad it's the most
0.00%:  it's more like he's made one
0.00%:  I have no idea where it gets
0.00%:  that last line is me
0.00%:  that doesn't work with sc
0.00%:  ever since he said
0.00%:  all I've got here is this stick
0.00%:  how did we get here I'
0.01%:  how did we get here I'm still
0.00%:  that's a weird thing I did
0.00%:  these two things are wild
0.00%:  it's makes
0.01%:  it's makes him the
0.00%:  all he did was solve the direct
0.00%:  I wish it was more like
0.00%:  that series
0.00%:  man there
0.03%:  man there's like
0.01%:  man there's like 
0.00%:  it was solved like
0.00%:  we've agreed this
0.01%:  we've agreed this is the
0.00%:  I'd still like to get him
0.00%:  it's him who was
0.00%:  it's almost 
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well add it
0.00%:  that's kinda how we decide
0.00%:  I loved
0.00%:  he liked cheese sand
0.00%:  I can't see how it's ever
0.00%:  he did some things
0.00%:  I'm kinda sad the
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad the world
0.00%:  that's like the worst made
0.00%:  I'd like to see what's in
0.00%:  it's his dad who came
0.00%:  it's his work that did
0.00%:  I'll end
0.00%:  he had it wrong;
0.00%:  it's weird how I know that
0.00%:  I might like this new world!!
0.00%:  that's a little weird so
0.00%:  that's all I've got; where
0.01%:  that's all I've got; where did
0.00%:  it seems like the world
0.00%:  I'd love to read this
0.00%:  we all know where
0.00%:  I've lied and
0.00%:  I think he was made
0.00%:  he wrote it with some
0.00%:  we'll have to work
0.00%:  there's like a school
0.00%:  I don't get how he was
0.00%:  it's still hard to decide who
0.00%:  it's the latter and he
0.01%:  it's the latter and he's dead
0.01%:  it's the latter and he died
0.00%:  I think it's great he's called
0.00%:  we never called the
0.00%:  it's a valid
0.00%:  it doesn't make him the god
0.00%:  while we're at it let's give him a second dad
0.00%:  I wish he'd never made it
0.00%:  I'd never met him til
0.00%:  that's worse when
0.00%:  doesn't that
0.01%:  doesn't that make
0.01%:  doesn't that make him a
0.00%:  it's all I've heard since
0.00%:  it's kinda weird he gave
0.00%:  let's stick with what we were
0.00%:  this is called a
0.00%:  that title makes me
0.00%:  I'd like him to give
0.00%:  he's no
0.00%:  I messed with his name
0.00%:  it's a case
0.00%:  it gets worse when he talks
0.00%:  we've all agreed this isn't how
0.00%:  this does make me wish I'd read
0.00%:  this is the worst met
0.00%:  when he asked it
0.00%:  he's still alive so we might as
0.00%:  we've all agreed with him
0.01%:  we've all agreed with him since
0.00%:  it's the world we live in that made me
0.00%:  wait I think we've made him
0.00%:  I added the other
0.00%:  what was I doing
0.01%:  what was I doing with
0.00%:  wait this might'
0.00%:  I'm doing these
0.00%:  it's kinda what got
0.00%:  he was more like this
0.00%:  that's still where I'm living
0.00%:  we need more
0.00%:  wait that'd
0.00%:  it still seems like
0.00%:  it's this weird game
0.01%:  it's this weird game called
0.00%:  I kinda wish that'
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree it's this
0.00%:  this is so great I've
0.00%:  all he did was stick the
0.01%:  all he did was stick the word
0.00%:  it's a slide
0.00%:  the math's kinda
0.00%:  I think this was a
0.00%:  it's more like I came
0.00%:  it's more like he was called that
0.00%:  we don't have his middle
0.00%:  he still likes his
0.00%:  he's dead now so it's weird that we call it
0.00%:  all I did was insert
0.00%:  he came to this
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well ev
0.00%:  this whole time I've talked
0.00%:  he might've died last week and
0.00%:  it's good that
0.01%:  it's good that we
0.01%:  it's good that we've
0.01%:  it's good that we're all
0.01%:  it's good that we're still
0.00%:  this is all I've read so
0.00%:  I'm so sick
0.00%:  I made the link with
0.00%:  it's worth doing
0.00%:  what I'd like right now is some sweet '
0.00%:  I think that's well
0.00%:  it's the second time I
0.15%:  it's the second time I've heard
0.04%:  it's the second time I've made
0.03%:  it's the second time I've said this
0.02%:  it's the second time I've read
0.02%:  it's the second time I've had
0.02%:  it's the second time I've read his
0.02%:  it's the second time I've made this
0.01%:  it's the second time I've read this
0.01%:  it's the second time I've said the
0.04%:  it's the second time I've said the word
0.01%:  it's the second time I've said the words
0.01%:  it's the second time I've heard it
0.01%:  it's the second time I've mis
0.01%:  it's the second time I've said it
0.01%:  it's the second time I've talked
0.01%:  it's the second time I've walked
0.00%:  it's the second time I've tried
0.00%:  there's a whole long
0.00%:  it's making me wish I wrote this
0.00%:  this is god
0.00%:  it made him the wrong
0.00%:  it's weird that he's making
0.00%:  he's still alive I made
0.00%:  all it did was solve the
0.00%:  it's while he
0.00%:  we can't make this
0.00%:  it's a law degree
0.00%:  all I did there was give the
0.00%:  what I did there was messed
0.00%:  I might write him
0.00%:  we're all his kids now
0.00%:  he doesn't like words
0.00%:  the whole last verse
0.00%:  wrong
0.00%:  it's the world we live in I'm least
0.00%:  I don't get how we've
0.00%:  don't make
0.00%:  I lied all
0.00%:  it is the world we'
0.00%:  it's the world we live in; what
0.00%:  it's all he's ever talked to
0.00%:  we'd call him that even
0.00%:  now that we've called
0.01%:  now that we've called him
0.00%:  that's still the weird
0.00%:  I wrote this and
0.00%:  it's the world as
0.02%:  it's the world as we live
0.01%:  it's the world as we knew
0.01%:  it's the world as we know it!!
0.01%:  it's the world as we know it;
0.00%:  it makes him a little
0.00%:  ever since I'm
0.00%:  I think he's dead; it
0.01%:  I think he's dead; it's weird
0.00%:  this is all I've got in me
0.00%:  this doesn't work with me
0.00%:  wait there's like ten
0.00%:  what it's called is the sem
0.00%:  I've made the last word
0.00%:  it's kinda what we
0.00%:  I don't see how we'll ever dis
0.00%:  wait that's weird;
0.00%:  I twe
0.00%:  it's more that he talked
0.00%:  it's more like it's called
0.00%: ; I've
0.00%:  I think this game
0.01%:  I think this game is called
0.00%:  he's still alive; I'm making the
0.00%:  I wrote all that down
0.01%:  I wrote all that down while
0.00%:  I was wrong; this
0.00%:  it's weird that I've come
0.01%:  it's weird that I've come this
0.00%:  the whole world's a
0.00%:  it's more like adding
0.00%:  it's him who is
0.00%:  I'd give the last
0.00%:  all I did was talk
0.00%:  I am making this all
0.00%:  it's a movie with
0.00%:  it's not clear who we'd give
0.00%:  I'd like to get some
0.00%:  I kinda get where he's com
0.00%:  I think this is great
0.00%:  it's kinda tragic how the
0.00%:  it's awesome how well this
0.00%:  he's still alive so he gets weird
0.00%:  he'd done
0.00%:  he died last week so there
0.00%:  we don't have a term like
0.00%:  it's more like vocal
0.00%:  he might've liked it more
0.00%:  I think his more
0.00%:  it's late
0.00%:  I worked in
0.00%:  I'd like to get this whole
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how he did
0.00%:  I'll admit it's kinda weird
0.00%:  I'd give the latter
0.00%:  it's more how he was
0.00%:  this doesn't work all
0.00%:  I've said this last
0.00%:  I don't care what he's like!!
0.00%:  I might as well have
0.00%:  whose work
0.00%:  this is all we ever
0.00%:  it's the latter; he's called
0.00%:  wait this is like
0.00%:  he's still alive and he gets cr
0.00%:  I'll admit this is more
0.00%:  what I'm doing here is m
0.00%:  I think he's dead so it's weird to give
0.00%:  I think there's a 
0.00%:  that's kinda grim
0.00%:  this is a lie!!
0.00%:  this is where I'd leave
0.00%:  I've got the name
0.00%:  it's like a twelve
0.00%:  it's more that he made a
0.00%:  the last line came
0.00%:  he got the credit
0.00%:  there I'm making that
0.00%:  the whole area
0.00%:  no his
0.00%:  that's a lie; I'd
0.00%:  he's dead since '
0.00%:  that's the world we lived in; I was
0.00%:  it's a weird thing called
0.00%:  I still love him
0.00%:  I kinda threw him
0.00%:  I wish it was called
0.00%:  all I did there was give him some
0.00%:  it's weird how he's gotten
0.00%:  it was me who wrote it!!
0.00%:  all it did was give them
0.00%:  it's more what he was
0.01%:  it's more what he was doing
0.00%:  it's his dad who gets called
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to add this
0.00%:  I think he was more so
0.00%:  all we're asking
0.00%:  i was
0.00%:  I think we made the
0.00%:  what he did was answer
0.00%:  it's now hard
0.00%:  he's still wrong
0.00%:  I think there's a lot we
0.00%:  it's like he did
0.00%:  it's review
0.00%:  this is all wrong; we
0.01%:  this is all wrong; we've
0.00%:  it's more like it's a
0.00%:  he's dead and we've
0.00%:  while we're at it I'm kind
0.00%:  it's him that made
0.00%:  I wonder who
0.00%:  wait does that make him
0.00%:  while I was making this video
0.00%:  it's more that he's given talks
0.00%:  this got kinda
0.04%:  this got kinda weird
0.00%:  I think there was a sem
0.00%:  it's the voice
0.00%:  this was more like the
0.00%:  I'd never said it
0.00%:  this doesn't give me a
0.00%:  it's me who's said the
0.00%:  it's worse than I've made it seem
0.00%:  I've looked at
0.01%:  I've looked at his
0.00%:  it made him the worst
0.00%:  it's still not clear how
0.00%:  it doesn't give me ch
0.00%:  I wrote this new
0.00%:  it's all thanks
0.00%:  it's more like what he's given
0.00%:  it's still me who gets the award
0.00%:  he's still alive so there's no
0.00%:  it's weird that I know his
0.01%:  it's weird that I know his middle
0.00%:  that was more the
0.00%:  it's making me wish I called
0.00%:  I might have to lie
0.00%:  it seems I'm
0.00%:  this is what I write down
0.00%:  wait this isn't the
0.01%:  wait this isn't the world
0.01%:  wait this isn't the world we'
0.00%:  we've like
0.00%:  it's me who said this
0.00%:  that's like their second
0.00%:  we have the same
0.00%:  it's the week
0.00%:  I've told
0.00%:  it's kinda clever how these
0.00%:  he said it's hard
0.00%:  it's given him a medal
0.00%:  we've heard it
0.00%:  it's more like a second dad
0.00%:  it's hard to talk while I'm eating so
0.00%:  we'll give him a second title
0.00%:  right now I like
0.00%:  it's more like he goes
0.00%:  it's the world we like
0.00%:  the second time I heard
0.00%:  I think it made him less
0.00%:  I might've added the sem
0.00%:  I'm a little less
0.00%:  wow that's awesome
0.00%:  I'd tell
0.00%:  while I'm here it
0.00%:  it's when he looked
0.00%:  I've kinda hated
0.00%:  it's making him what
0.00%:  we'd like to see him
0.00%:  it was the doctor
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to get him
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this is how we'll
0.00%:  all we've got is some
0.00%:  he was right in
0.00%:  the second is what
0.00%:  I think we've still got some
0.00%:  it's like the whole class
0.00%:  this might not work
0.00%:  it's me who's his
0.00%:  he's sem
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how these sem
0.00%:  it's more like he made his own
0.00%:  it's what it's called where
0.00%:  we'll give him an
0.00%:  it's still coming
0.00%:  we've all agreed that we won
0.00%:  what he did was write down like
0.00%:  don't tell him I wrote this
0.00%:  this is making me have
0.00%:  I added the line
0.00%:  we call them gods
0.00%:  doesn't make him that
0.00%:  I'd like to see what he does
0.00%:  it doesn't matter how well I
0.00%:  it's a video game where I
0.00%:  it's him who's made it
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well nick
0.00%:  the world's like that
0.00%:  it's clever how the
0.00%:  it's a little more like
0.00%:  this is the second worst
0.00%:  I'm kinda wish
0.00%:  I lied he never asked
0.00%:  I got this whole
0.00%:  since he's dead I'
0.00%:  he died last week; his last
0.00%:  the others
0.00%:  that'd work
0.00%:  it's a single word with the
0.00%:  all I've said is the word
0.00%:  I think it's his mom
0.00%:  a sem
0.00%:  he called it that
0.00%:  his name has
0.00%:  we gave him the latter nick
0.00%:  it never talks
0.00%:  now that I hear
0.00%:  he'll get his
0.00%:  he did this like
0.00%:  these last two lines were added like
0.00%:  it's weird how the name
0.00%:  I've added more
0.00%:  what it's made him is tired
0.00%:  I'm having a weird time
0.01%:  I'm having a weird time with
0.00%:  I'd still like him to give me the
0.03%:  I'd still like him to give me the answer
0.00%:  it doesn't make him a child
0.00%:  that's wrong; what
0.00%:  he's done other
0.00%:  how do we
0.00%:  wait that's wrong this
0.00%:  I think it's more he's a
0.00%:  he never gets
0.01%:  he never gets called
0.00%:  that's what gave me
0.00%:  it's kinda awesome how we
0.00%:  I think it was either
0.00%:  he's still alive and he's worked a
0.00%:  the latter's a nick
0.00%:  all he did was move
0.00%:  I've messed with the tim
0.00%:  this doesn't seem that
0.01%:  this doesn't seem that weird
0.00%:  he's still alive so it's a
0.00%:  all it did was get him the 
0.00%:  I kinda wish this were a
0.00%:  what he did is make some
0.00%:  that's two things
0.00%:  I think that's less clever
0.00%:  that's the world we lived in last week'
0.00%:  I love this new
0.05%:  I love this new world we
0.03%:  I love this new world we'
0.00%:  this is making me dread
0.00%:  he has never liked
0.00%:  this is the wrong decade
0.00%:  I have a lot
0.00%:  I've added those last eight
0.00%:  no I've made it
0.00%:  we don't agree with this last
0.00%:  I've said this once
0.00%:  what's coming
0.00%:  all he did was co
0.00%:  this is the sem
0.00%:  I don't what
0.00%:  that was god
0.00%:  when he asked me
0.00%:  I don't agree with most
0.00%:  it's more like called him that
0.00%:  I lied; he did
0.00%:  this is kinda the world
0.08%:  this is kinda the world we lived
0.01%:  this is kinda the world we'
0.00%:  we've still gotta write
0.00%:  we've all since agreed that we'd like
0.00%:  all he's done is give me
0.00%:  it's weird I know all
0.01%:  it's weird I know all these
0.00%:  I'm the one who's made it
0.00%:  he's got a weird
0.00%:  it's still a secret what
0.01%:  it's still a secret what he likes
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like the
0.00%:  I'm in love with the word
0.00%:  this is where I'm at
0.00%:  it's all hard
0.00%:  I might add some
0.00%:  that's twice
0.00%:  that was che
0.00%:  he's dead and the
0.00%:  he's not a real
0.00%:  it's what led him to work
0.00%:  it's making him the less
0.00%:  I think it was more '
0.00%:  it's high
0.01%:  it's high time we
0.00%:  it's high time I wrote
0.00%:  we're doing his
0.00%:  I think there's some law
0.00%:  it's like the world was
0.00%:  it's kinda wild
0.00%:  it's a word I
0.00%:  while we're at it I might as well kiss
0.00%:  the latter is how we
0.00%:  that's me who wrote it
0.00%:  it's earned
0.03%:  it's earned him the
0.00%:  it's the world we live in like
0.00%:  that's new
0.00%:  the hell
0.00%:  while we're at it I need
0.00%:  I think it's what we
0.00%:  this is like what
0.00%:  now I've said it it's clear
0.00%:  I've heard his nick
0.00%:  it might have said
0.00%:  I'd give like
0.00%:  he's gotta
0.00%:  wait that'd make
0.00%:  I'll let him make
0.00%:  since he's alive
0.00%:  it's like the most clever
0.00%:  we're still asking him the
0.00%:  he made it in
0.00%:  these are his middle
0.00%:  this third
0.00%:  that's like the entire
0.00%:  that was the wrong voice
0.00%:  wait I've made him the second
0.00%:  it gives me the he
0.00%:  he might not like it
0.00%:  it's when he made
0.00%:  I named it
0.00%:  he's still alive and he made
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that we all
0.00%:  his work is still sem
0.00%:  I don't like this world we've made; it seems
0.00%:  we made him the
0.00%:  I think we called the
0.00%:  it's shame
0.00%:  I made the world
0.00%:  I think it's time we all gave
0.00%:  wait this doesn't seem like the
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like the world
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like the world we'
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like the world I
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like the world I'
0.01%:  wait this doesn't seem like the world I'd live
0.00%:  we've all agreed that this new
0.00%:  I write it down
0.00%:  this is where I'm moving
0.00%:  it's a game called
0.00%:  I heard it was the
0.00%:  now that we've re
0.00%:  it's like a class
0.00%:  we can't tell him
0.00%:  I might have added in some
0.00%:  when I write it like this
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree that we
0.01%:  I think we'd all agree that we've
0.00%:  he sits
0.00%:  we'll give him the same title
0.00%:  it's still a hard
0.00%:  it's the world we wish we lived in; I made
0.00%:  this is where I got all
0.00%:  it's other things
0.00%:  I'm wrong he
0.00%:  there's still a slight
0.00%:  this is making it worse; I've
0.00%:  it's called the same
0.00%:  all he did was give these
0.00%:  i'm making it
0.00%:  while that's great
0.00%:  he's real good at it
0.00%:  we've come to
0.00%:  I've made him the one
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how it's all
0.00%:  that was me who said it
0.00%:  this got weird when we
0.00%:  he's still alive; he's awesome
0.00%:  this all makes me wonder what
0.00%:  these are all lies I
0.00%:  the title's like
0.00%:  all I did here was switch some
0.00%:  we'll talk
0.01%:  we'll talk more
0.00%:  we have to switch
0.00%:  it's gone over well
0.01%:  it's gone over well with
0.00%:  it's called two
0.00%:  the last line's made
0.00%:  he's more like a sem
0.00%:  this is what I've read
0.00%:  all he did is give the
0.00%:  he kinda hated it
0.00%:  what I'm asking is how
0.00%:  it seems like he's dead
0.00%:  that's made me sad
0.00%:  don't give him a medal
0.00%:  I lied he's more like
0.00%:  I think it's review
0.00%:  we gave him a medal with
0.00%:  give me a second there
0.00%:  I'd like to write that down
0.00%:  that still works with
0.00%:  it's more like he's a semi
0.00%:  this made the world
0.00%:  we'd like to give the
0.02%:  we'd like to give the award
0.00%:  it's like eight words and
0.00%:  this is rad
0.00%:  it's made him not
0.00%:  it does seem like he'd
0.00%:  what I've said here is wild
0.00%:  he's still alive so don't c
0.00%:  it's the other d
0.00%:  this doesn't work as well as the
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how his middle
0.00%:  I kinda made some
0.00%:  the video game world
0.00%:  this'd
0.01%:  this'd make
0.00%:  it's given him three
0.00%:  what it's done is drive
0.00%:  it's more what we
0.01%:  it's more what we call the
0.00%:  I'd heard it's called the
0.00%:  it's like a movie
0.01%:  it's like a movie called
0.00%:  this is the 
0.00%:  there's still some things we'
0.00%:  no he was
0.00%:  it's sel
0.00%:  it's more like he doesn't have a middle
0.00%:  wait this isn't how
0.00%:  it's weird how that makes sense
0.00%:  I think we're all god
0.00%:  that's a little weird; I'd
0.01%:  that's a little weird; I'd change
0.00%:  I don't get his work
0.00%:  it's the second word I'd
0.00%:  while we're at it let's give him a kn
0.00%:  it's hard to make things
0.00%:  I don't see how we'll make this
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad it's still the same
0.00%:  it's like he gets
0.01%:  it's like he gets credit
0.00%:  that's making this weird
0.00%:  he gets all the credit and I'm like
0.00%:  he did lots
0.00%:  I made his entire
0.00%:  all it did was give me the worst
0.00%:  I'd like to see this made
0.00%:  we've got him listed as the
0.00%:  we all know his sem
0.00%:  it's too weird
0.00%:  while he did make
0.00%:  now that we've said this we'll
0.00%:  he doesn't like '
0.00%:  now I've made it worse
0.00%:  wait this doesn't work what
0.00%:  I've made the whole last
0.00%:  it's not like we
0.01%:  it's not like we've
0.01%:  it's not like we've made
0.01%:  it's not like we have
0.00%:  it's all I've got here
0.00%: ; it's made him a
0.00%:  wait where did I get these
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to add some
0.00%:  he still needs
0.00%:  I don't see how we'd live
0.00%:  he was asked to review it
0.00%:  it's weird how this is
0.00%:  the math was wrong
0.00%:  I kinda wish he'd get more
0.00%:  it's the kids who are called
0.00%:  it doesn't matter which god
0.00%:  he's alive and he's like
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he's lived
0.00%:  his kids were con
0.00%:  is this the
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that I have
0.00%:  this does make me wish I was
0.00%:  I think we missed the last
0.01%:  I think we missed the last word
0.00%:  now that we've made this weird
0.00%:  it means he's worked
0.00%:  this makes things worse!!
0.00%:  it's still great when
0.00%:  I did read
0.00%:  I don't agree with these
0.00%:  no I'll
0.00%:  it's what comes
0.00%:  it's a little closer
0.00%:  I've added the sem
0.00%:  this is where I leave it
0.00%:  I'm kinda sad this might
0.00%:  it's kinda this whole
0.00%:  this isn't where I'
0.00%:  it's making him so
0.00%:  all I'm doing is read
0.00%:  it's more like dead
0.00%:  it's like a thing where we'
0.00%:  it's got like twelve
0.00%:  it's a video game he worked
0.00%:  what he made is
0.00%:  it makes him get
0.00%:  I think there's some wig
0.00%:  I lied that's his
0.00%:  we've all agreed that we think
0.00%:  I have no idea what we're still
0.00%:  that's the worst lie
0.00%:  he's dead now so it's weird we
0.00%:  he said he did
0.00%:  it has some
0.00%:  that's wrong the
0.00%:  we've all agreed that we don't like him so
0.00%:  what's weird is that I didn
0.00%:  what it did was give rise to the class
0.00%:  this is the single weird
0.00%:  I think we all have to agree
0.00%:  I got the last
0.00%:  it's like him
0.00%:  that's wrong I've made him
0.00%:  we might as well switch over
0.00%:  all that did was give me some weird
0.00%:  that's what it's like now
0.00%:  what he did was give some nice
0.00%:  that's wrong; I'd
0.00%:  all I did was mess with some
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well disc
0.00%:  I messed it all
0.00%:  he never said he was
0.00%:  we call him the great
0.00%:  since he's still alive we'
0.00%:  I wrote this while making a
0.00%:  no wait that's the
0.01%:  no wait that's the weird
0.00%:  I'm making the rh
0.00%:  I messed the whole
0.00%:  he's gotten
0.00%:  I've called it the
0.00%:  it's not a well
0.00%:  it's kinda weird we call him
0.00%:  it talked
0.00%:  he still likes ice
0.00%:  it's more like he's had it
0.00%:  this is all wrong; I'm like
0.00%:  this makes it seem
0.00%:  we're at like
0.00%:  he's alive and worked with me at
0.00%:  it has me
0.00%:  he died last week and it's still
0.00%:  there's a thing I
0.00%:  I'm no
0.00%:  what it's done is made the
0.01%:  what it's done is made the world
0.01%:  what it's done is made the world'
0.00%:  while we're at it that's me
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how we get
0.00%:  we're all living the
0.00%:  it's the world we live in I'd
0.00%:  I lied he never did
0.00%:  I'd like to close this
0.01%:  I'd like to close this with
0.00%:  we can make
0.01%:  we can make this
0.00%:  this is all wrong; I've made him
0.00%:  I think that's mess
0.00%:  it's less clear who gets
0.00%:  give me a sec while I look
0.01%:  give me a sec while I look this
0.00%:  I don't like how that reads
0.00%:  it's more like he was doing his
0.00%:  I like this new world the most
0.00%:  he's still alive; he doesn't work
0.00%:  how'd this
0.00%:  I liked it when he
0.00%:  this is kinda sweet
0.00%:  I'd like to hear this song
0.00%:  like the
0.00%:  that's a lie; he never asked
0.00%:  it's the other one'
0.00%:  this is the world we live in so
0.00%:  he's still alive and was there
0.00%:  I'm kinda sad this is the world we'll get
0.00%:  he died last week so that's weird!!
0.00%:  it's more like he's added a
0.00%:  it's never said
0.00%:  now I've said it it's the
0.00%:  we have him listed twice
0.00%:  he cared
0.00%:  all I've got there is his middle
0.00%:  it's hard to give him a nick
0.00%:  what I meant is he
0.01%:  what I meant is he's like
0.00%:  it's all there is
0.00%:  he's taking
0.00%:  it's more like video games!!
0.00%:  in that case I'
0.00%:  I'd still like some answer
0.00%:  I think we'll leave the word
0.00%:  that's where I saw
0.00%:  that's hella weird
0.00%:  it's this game
0.02%:  it's this game where
0.01%:  it's this game called
0.00%:  he said I
0.00%:  that is more
0.00%:  since I'm the
0.00%:  we've all come this
0.00%:  that's weird; the
0.00%:  what I'm asking is where did
0.00%:  the latter might'
0.00%:  it's wrong that
0.00%:  this is what we'll
0.00%:  he's still alive and wishes
0.00%:  it's more like he's dead and his
0.00%:  I'd like to hear that
0.00%:  I've made him that since it
0.01%:  I've made him that since it's like
0.00%:  no I'm sick
0.00%:  I think it's weird to have
0.00%:  this is so awesome I've
0.00%:  I'd like to see where that'
0.00%:  wait I've heard
0.00%:  wait I've heard this
0.00%:  it's like I have
0.00%:  it gives him his
0.00%:  this is where I kind
0.00%:  I've made the doctor
0.00%:  it's the right
0.00%:  it seems he's called
0.00%:  I wish he'd like
0.00%:  I think it'd have made
0.00%:  this c
0.00%:  that's the worst line I've said
0.06%:  that's the worst line I've said all week
0.01%:  that's the worst line I've said all week!!
0.00%:  that's the world we lived in last sem
0.00%:  we live in the same world we did last time
0.00%:  it's weird that I'm doing a
0.00%:  it's still a secret what he'
0.00%:  it seems like he's had
0.00%:  that's wrong he died like
0.00%:  I think we messed that
0.00%:  all I've made
0.00%:  I never looked
0.00%:  that's so awesome
0.01%:  that's so awesome I might
0.01%:  that's so awesome I might write
0.00%:  those last two lines were added while we
0.00%:  it gives me ch
0.00%:  he's still alive so that makes
0.00%:  what's awesome
0.00%:  I think we all agree it's a
0.00%:  I think he came later
0.00%:  I heard he's dead
0.00%:  I think we solved
0.00%:  he's making the world's most
0.00%:  what it did was make his
0.00%:  that made more
0.00%:  don't ask me what I
0.01%:  don't ask me what I did
0.01%:  don't ask me what I did with
0.00%:  god didn
0.00%:  I've no idea who made
0.00%:  we can't tell who's the
0.00%:  that's wrong it makes
0.00%:  I wish we lived in that world;
0.00%:  this whole time I was making words
0.00%:  I can't see what'
0.00%:  all I did was switch the words in
0.00%:  what we're living
0.00%:  it's more him and
0.00%:  I'd love to see him win
0.00%:  that makes me write
0.00%:  this is what I'm making
0.00%:  I did this when
0.00%:  we're having this little
0.00%:  what I think we did
0.00%:  I think what we've said
0.00%:  it's more like he gave the sem
0.00%:  wait I think it
0.03%:  wait I think it's called
0.02%:  wait I think it's more
0.01%:  wait I think it's the
0.01%:  wait I think it's called the
0.00%:  we'll have to credit
0.00%:  it's more like I've made his
0.00%:  that's where I get all
0.00%:  that seems like an
0.00%:  it's more like his dad who
0.00%:  all we've got is this weird
0.00%:  he's agreed
0.00%:  I saw him at
0.00%:  I'm glad we're done with this;
0.00%:  I think it was closer
0.00%:  what I did was make the
0.00%:  it'd make more sense as
0.00%:  it's weird he gets
0.01%:  it's weird he gets called
0.00%:  doctor is
0.00%:  what he did was write down '
0.00%:  I don't care what he likes so
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how we're still
0.00%:  it makes him have
0.00%:  this seems to have worked well
0.00%:  I tried making the
0.00%:  he's like in
0.00%:  he did it the same
0.00%:  it doesn't matter how he's made
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how little we've come with
0.00%:  wait I'm wrong that's his
0.01%:  wait I'm wrong that's his middle
0.00%:  I think we've all agreed that's too
0.00%:  it's the third time
0.00%:  I think we've all missed what
0.00%:  that's the world we lived in last week!! I was
0.00%:  we asked
0.00%:  I've heard it's the second
0.00%:  his words
0.00%:  that was the worst I
0.00%:  we've called this entire
0.00%:  it's made him the latter;
0.00%:  that's what it's called like
0.00%:  while it's a
0.01%:  while it's a great
0.00%:  I don't see what's so weird with
0.00%:  we're a little less
0.00%:  it's more like dec
0.00%:  when I talk
0.00%:  wait don
0.01%:  wait don't write
0.00%:  I'm doing it with
0.00%:  it's like less
0.00%:  now that I've said it al
0.00%:  I wrote this while med
0.00%:  I might've made that entire
0.00%:  it makes me wish I'd said
0.00%:  he's still alive and he's made
0.00%:  we all need to work
0.00%:  that's a thing we call
0.00%:  what I've done is make the
0.00%:  I think it's the world's most
0.00%:  I think there's some legal
0.00%:  I think it's made me
0.00%:  we're taking that
0.00%:  it's like three sem
0.00%:  I think we've missed this
0.00%:  we don't have a lot
0.00%:  wait I made this whole
0.00%:  it won't let me rh
0.00%:  that made me sick to
0.00%:  it's also kind
0.00%:  it's weird that we've come
0.00%:  it's me who's the god
0.00%:  we're all those
0.00%:  we're all in the
0.01%:  we're all in the middle
0.00%:  we've all agreed that it's like
0.00%:  that's as
0.00%:  that's what we'll
0.00%:  he was still a kid
0.00%:  it's the world we lived in with
0.00%:  that's a more
0.00%:  I'll let him give
0.00%:  it's what he solved
0.00%:  I think it's the most
0.00%:  it's the world we once
0.00%:  wait I think that
0.01%:  wait I think that's called
0.00%:  all he did was create some
0.00%:  it's still a mess
0.00%:  I think we've missed him
0.00%:  I've said these words twice
0.00%:  I think all he did was review
0.00%:  this is me right
0.00%:  I knew he
0.00%:  I think we might've said it
0.00%:  the second word is like
0.00%:  that's more like a met
0.00%:  that's almost right
0.00%:  that's not the case
0.00%:  the two are kinda
0.00%:  I've added the last eight lines
0.00%:  it's called the single
0.00%:  what it's like
0.00%:  that works in
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how he still
0.00%:  wait that is
0.00%:  that's a lie; he never said
0.00%:  we'd like to award him
0.00%:  while we're in
0.00%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in we
0.00%:  he's asking the
0.00%:  this does make things
0.01%:  this does make things weird
0.00%:  wait there's the
0.00%:  it's still a secret who the
0.00%:  we've got other
0.00%:  I was making that whole
0.00%:  I think we'll leave the rest
0.00%:  it's more like child
0.00%:  wait this is all wrong I've mess
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he's come
0.00%:  all he did was write two
0.00%:  this has gotten
0.01%:  this has gotten weird
0.00%:  I'm making it the world
0.00%:  we've still got that whole
0.00%:  all these words make me
0.00%:  I can't get over how well his middle
0.00%:  it's a little weird and
0.00%:  it's the world we lived in at some
0.00%:  his work was done while
0.00%:  his talk was more
0.00%:  I think he added it
0.00%:  he died last week at 
0.00%:  it's more like the end
0.00%:  this is more like how
0.00%:  what I've said here makes it seem
0.00%:  I don't see how he was
0.00%:  this is the world we live in; I was
0.00%:  I still like how the
0.00%:  now that I've said it we might as well work
0.00%:  I think it's the world we'd all
0.00%:  he never saw
0.00%:  his real name's like
0.00%:  we've all agreed this is now the most
0.00%:  he heard
0.00%:  it's more like how he was given
0.00%:  I like his real
0.00%:  I'll take this down
0.00%:  there's some things I'm
0.00%:  it's more like weight
0.00%:  I think he's alive;
0.00%:  this was hard
0.00%:  we've lost all
0.00%:  we'll give him the same credit
0.00%:  I've heard it's all
0.00%:  it made him that like 
0.00%:  that's a little weird when we'
0.00%:  what I did there was slide
0.00%:  this gives me idea
0.00%:  now he
0.01%:  now he's dead
0.00%:  I think this met
0.00%:  I still need to work
0.00%:  his middle name's still
0.00%:  the kids call them
0.00%:  he's more like that
0.00%:  it's kinda hard to tell who made
0.00%:  I think we'd all get
0.00%:  we've tried to get
0.00%:  he was all
0.00%:  he's sick
0.00%:  it's more like he doesn't give
0.00%:  this is what I read
0.00%:  he's missed
0.00%:  that's weird how it ended
0.00%:  that's still right
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he's ever said a
0.00%:  I've added a lot
0.00%:  I kinda hate the
0.00%:  what it did was make him world
0.00%:  I've said his name like
0.00%:  he's more like the dead
0.00%:  this made him kind
0.00%:  within
0.00%:  the world we live in might'
0.00%:  it's more like al
0.00%:  I have no idea how well liked
0.00%:  I think what we've all come
0.00%:  he died last week and it's all
0.00%:  he's their
0.00%:  it's more like this thing
0.02%:  it's more like this thing called
0.00%:  he never had
0.00%:  wait I think we missed the
0.00%:  I've come down with a mild
0.00%:  it's more like he's its
0.00%:  I have no idea what's more
0.00%:  we're still like two
0.00%:  it's weird that I'm making the
0.00%:  let's strike the
0.00%:  give him the award and
0.00%:  I've made some slight re
0.00%:  it's the worlds
0.00%:  the second two
0.00%:  he's still alive so it's not
0.00%:  I got sick
0.00%:  I think it's all his
0.00%:  I'm aware this might
0.00%:  he's still alive is
0.01%:  he's still alive is what
0.00%:  he's since walked
0.00%:  that was more like twelve
0.00%:  that gives him like 
0.00%:  it's the second to
0.00%:  this is their
0.00%:  I'll have the
0.00%:  I'll go make
0.00%:  the last thing was added
0.00%:  that's like the worst advice
0.00%:  I did a whole
0.00%:  it's hard to tell who's making claims
0.00%:  in his case it's the
0.00%:  all I did was write that down while
0.00%:  we'll leave it
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well de
0.00%:  what I said here is
0.00%:  the second's a
0.01%:  the second's a lie
0.00%:  all I did was write the ch
0.00%:  it's all right to
0.00%:  the world we live in did
0.00%:  wait there's a slight
0.00%:  that made me lose
0.00%:  it's less awesome when I write
0.00%:  I've said a
0.00%:  it made him a world class
0.00%:  I lied he's still dead
0.00%:  go ahead
0.00%:  he's great with
0.00%:  all he ever did was sketch
0.00%:  this isn't how it works at
0.00%:  there's a lot we still need
0.00%:  these two things are called
0.00%:  I think we might write
0.00%:  I've said it wrong twice
0.00%:  the last two lines were added while we
0.00%:  what he did was give it some
0.00%:  I'm glad we solved the whole
0.00%:  he's still alive and I'm weird
0.00%:  I don't like this world that we
0.01%:  I don't like this world that we'
0.00%:  it's more the math
0.00%:  it's kinda weird he's got the
0.00%:  what he did was write some notes
0.00%:  we'll go
0.09%:  we'll go with the second
0.07%:  we'll go with the latter
0.01%:  we'll go with that
0.01%:  we'll go ahead
0.01%:  we'll go with the last
0.01%:  we'll go with that second
0.01%:  we'll go ahead and strike
0.00%:  that's what it's called; I looked
0.00%:  it's his work on sem
0.00%:  we now
0.01%:  we now call him
0.01%:  we now call him the
0.00%:  we're adding the last
0.00%:  we made him write this
0.00%:  I did the same
0.00%:  I'm making it the hell
0.00%:  he was in grad
0.00%:  what it's done is give him a lot
0.00%:  I think we've all agreed with me
0.00%:  this makes me wish I were still
0.00%:  this time I'
0.00%:  what I meant were
0.00%:  I'd like to see him and
0.01%:  I'd like to see him and his
0.00%:  I think there's too
0.00%:  I can't ever see
0.00%:  I wrote that while adding
0.00%:  that made it worse I
0.00%:  it's more like his two
0.00%:  while we're at this I
0.01%:  while we're at this I'd like to ded
0.00%:  it's weird that I've got
0.00%:  I don't get how that makes
0.00%:  it's like weird
0.00%:  it's worst when he talks
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how the last
0.00%:  it's all I have time
0.00%:  while we're at it let's make it
0.00%:  it doesn't work as well as I'd wished it
0.00%:  it's hard to decide what line
0.00%:  this leaves me with some weird
0.00%:  wait this doesn't work what'
0.00%:  there's a video on
0.00%:  these two things make
0.00%:  I'm wrong this was
0.00%:  this song has like
0.00%:  I'll give the last
0.00%:  that's kinda his middle
0.00%:  it's more that we've made
0.00%:  I'd call it more like his
0.00%:  it's making me a little sad how we
0.01%:  it's making me a little sad how we're
0.01%:  it's making me a little sad how we've lost
0.00%:  I'd like to leave this
0.00%:  wait; I
0.00%:  while we're at it his middle
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he was right
0.00%:  we'd like to give the award to the
0.00%:  that last line there
0.00%:  let's make this a
0.00%:  the worlds
0.00%:  that's so weird I might
0.00%:  now I'm glad
0.00%:  what it did was make the world
0.00%:  all he did was give the most
0.00%:  now that we've said the word twice
0.00%: ; it's still
0.00%:  that's how come
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that we've called this
0.00%:  it gave the world the
0.00%:  there's no law
0.00%:  all I ever did was watch
0.00%:  what I'd like most is some
0.00%:  I've still got a whole
0.00%:  he seems like he's still
0.00%:  it made him the origin
0.00%:  I lied that was the
0.00%:  it's all made me kind
0.00%:  this seems kinda racist!!
0.00%:  I'd still have
0.00%:  this gives me a whole
0.00%:  this doesn't work as well as it'
0.00%:  there's a lot in
0.00%:  while we're at it I might add
0.00%:  I've no idea how this makes
0.00%:  I don't like it either!!
0.00%:  I might do
0.00%:  it's more like his math
0.00%:  I'd love to meet him!!
0.00%:  it's more like he named it
0.00%:  all I know is he made
0.00%:  I lied there's like twelve
0.00%:  while we're at it let's do the
0.00%:  we've added some
0.00%:  this is me who's made
0.00%:  here's this
0.00%:  he's right at
0.00%:  while we're at it let's close down
0.00%:  I kinda threw this
0.00%:  it's the math side
0.00%:  this is making me a little sad!!
0.00%:  it's weird that we can
0.00%:  it's more like all his
0.00%:  he might've looked
0.00%:  he was making more
0.00%:  a single
0.00%:  the world's still the same;
0.00%:  it's gone over well with the kids
0.00%:  it's made him a child
0.00%:  I read all
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well m
0.00%:  we've all agreed to stick with his middle
0.00%:  it's more like he's a dad to
0.00%:  it's not like he's called
0.00%:  I think it gets
0.01%:  I think it gets worse
0.00%:  he's solved it
0.00%:  I've got a whole list
0.00%:  it's like these two things are
0.00%:  wait we're still in
0.00%:  that's the second time I've mess
0.00%:  that's his middle name; I'
0.00%:  this is new
0.00%:  this is the middle
0.00%:  I don't like this world we've made that
0.00%:  I think we'd have to re
0.00%:  it's weird how things like
0.00%:  I'll have to write it
0.00%:  is the
0.00%:  this is a lie; I'
0.01%:  this is a lie; I've
0.01%:  this is a lie; I'm making
0.01%:  this is a lie; I've made
0.00%:  it's still a weird
0.00%:  we'd like the
0.01%:  we'd like the answer
0.00%:  that gives me sh
0.00%:  I'd watch that movie!!
0.00%:  since it's the world
0.00%:  I'd like them to change
0.00%:  it's what he's doing
0.00%:  we've made him that in
0.00%:  that's like an
0.00%:  what I think we've all come
0.00%:  he's still alive and grew
0.00%:  when he died last week I
0.00%:  it's weird;
0.00%:  wow there's a whole
0.00%:  it's the time
0.00%:  he never said he dis
0.00%:  I have so
0.00%:  this is what's making me decide
0.00%:  I'm sick now
0.00%:  it's me that's the
0.00%:  it's making me r
0.00%:  I've listed him in
0.00%:  he still likes math more
0.00%:  I might've like made
0.00%:  I've talked him down
0.00%:  it's the world we lived in last week; I missed the
0.00%:  he's de
0.00%:  all I did was write it
0.00%:  it does make me wish I'd never
0.00%:  he doesn't write it
0.00%:  I think math
0.00%:  this is weird;
0.00%:  it was his dad who worked
0.00%:  we've called the entire
0.00%:  what I like is when
0.00%:  it's more like what I do
0.00%:  we don't have to decide
0.00%:  I might have added it
0.00%:  I'd like to have more
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what's the
0.00%:  I might've messed that second
0.00%:  I think we've all come a
0.00%:  it will make him that
0.00%:  it's called when
0.00%:  he was a mat
0.00%:  he was more like one
0.00%:  he's a more
0.00%:  I kinda wish this were less
0.00%:  don't give him that
0.01%:  don't give him that credit
0.01%:  don't give him that award
0.00%:  he's dead so that
0.09%:  he's dead so that's weird
0.00%:  what's wrong with me I'
0.00%:  we can't read it
0.00%:  this is wrong I'
0.00%:  it's now a crime
0.00%:  I lied; we
0.01%:  I lied; we're living
0.00%:  it does make me wonder what'
0.01%:  it does make me wonder what's with
0.00%:  no that's a
0.01%:  no that's a weird
0.01%:  no that's a lie
0.00%:  let's see
0.01%:  let's see what
0.00%:  while we're at it we have
0.00%:  I want him
0.00%:  what I've done here is disc
0.00%:  that's a e
0.00%:  it doesn't work that well as a m
0.00%:  he's called it the
0.00%:  it's kinda gross with
0.02%:  it's kinda gross with cheese
0.00%:  second
0.00%:  that's a lie made
0.00%:  it's more like he's his
0.00%:  I'd like to credit the
0.00%:  I'd like more cheese
0.00%:  it's hard to tell what's legend
0.00%:  it was more like he was the
0.00%:  it's wrong to call them
0.00%:  I don't see how he ever did

0.00%:  it's a little weird when we get
0.00%:  it's making me wish I'd read less
0.00%:  we've all agreed the last
0.00%:  I can't get over this whole
0.00%:  I think we came
0.00%:  it made him co
0.00%:  it's more that he gets
0.00%:  I've heard he's a little
0.00%:  it was like his third
0.00%:  while we're at it we've all got
0.00%:  he's also called
0.00%:  let me take this
0.00%:  this was a little
0.00%:  I'd call them the
0.00%:  I've read it like twice so
0.00%:  it's what it's called when it
0.00%:  this is what I've dream
0.00%:  what he did is kind
0.00%:  wait here
0.00%:  he likes all sorts
0.00%:  gave him
0.00%:  I've long
0.00%:  what I've said there is mis
0.00%:  that's kinda where I get
0.00%:  this all makes me wonder how

0.00%:  I don't where this
0.01%:  I don't where this came
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that he's also
0.00%:  I wrote this while sick so
0.00%:  we'd like that
0.00%:  while I'm at it this seems
0.00%:  he's still alive and he got it
0.00%:  let's stick with him as
0.00%:  I grew
0.00%:  all it's done is made him the
0.00%:  all it's done is made him the world
0.00%:  it was like three whole
0.00%:  he'd never said it
0.00%:  he doesn't get a credit
0.00%:  there's a '
0.00%:  I think he's called a god
0.00%:  it's more like we've all gone
0.00%:  it's making me wish the world
0.00%:  we're still making those
0.00%:  that's like some
0.00%:  it's kinda made me wish
0.00%:  I've got this weird mental
0.00%:  it's still awesome when
0.00%:  I think he's mis
0.00%:  I think he's read
0.00%:  when I write it all
0.00%:  it made him all those
0.00%:  that seems kinda weird!!
0.00%:  I have got
0.00%:  he's died like seven
0.00%:  what I'm asking is does
0.00%:  wait how is
0.00%:  that was like the second worst
0.00%:  I'm glad this isn
0.03%:  I'm glad this isn't the world we lived
0.02%:  I'm glad this isn't the real
0.01%:  I'm glad this isn't real
0.00%:  all I know is it's a
0.00%:  it is the world'
0.00%:  we don't call him that; it's more like a
0.00%:  I've got no idea what it's called there
0.00%:  he's still alive and we worked it
0.00%:  it gives me the sh
0.00%:  let's all agree to switch
0.00%:  we've all agreed we'd like
0.00%:  this makes me wonder how well
0.00%:  we've all agreed to stick with his name
0.00%:  what's weird is that I've talked
0.00%:  no it's more like he's had
0.00%:  I'd still like to see him win
0.00%:  I'd still like to see him win the award
0.00%:  that's the least we
0.00%:  he's got the same middle
0.00%:  these lines have
0.00%:  it's making him the co
0.00%:  he's still active and works
0.00%:  it's more like called his
0.00%:  it's weird that we call him a
0.00%:  all he did was model the
0.00%:  it's like the worst idea
0.00%:  we still need more
0.00%:  it was all his
0.00%:  I kinda wish we were all
0.00%:  that's cooler
0.00%:  there's like a w
0.00%:  all it's done is give him a sweet
0.00%:  let's all decide
0.00%:  a great
0.00%:  wait I've got it all mess

0.00%:  I can't see how this will
0.01%:  I can't see how this will ever
0.01%:  I can't see how this will ever get
0.00%:  the last line's a
0.00%:  it's more like the dad whose
0.00%:  I'm taking a
0.00%:  I think he's a logic
0.00%:  that write
0.00%:  it's more like st
0.00%:  it's weird how long this
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad we missed this
0.00%:  we've had like two
0.00%:  it's the latter I'm having
0.00%:  that one's a
0.00%:  all we've got here
0.00%:  the idea's kinda
0.00%:  it's more like he was given the middle
0.00%:  I'd like to watch the
0.00%:  it doesn't make him called
0.00%:  what it's made him is de
0.00%:  we think it was the
0.00%:  I've no idea what's more
0.00%:  it's all this work
0.00%:  it's more like middle aged
0.00%:  I had him write down
0.00%:  that's the world we living
0.00%:  it's made him a lot rich
0.00%:  I'll give him his own
0.00%:  I think the movie was called '
0.00%:  when I read it it seemed
0.00%:  he also did a
0.00%:  it's making him the last
0.00%:  I'd still give the award to the
0.00%:  it's like he's got
0.00%:  this is making me hor
0.00%:  I can't see how he'd
0.00%:  I can't see how he'd get
0.00%:  he gets a little mad when we
0.00%:  he's still alive; I'm good with
0.00%:  I think this all
0.00%: ; I think he
0.01%: ; I think he's more
0.00%:  he's dead so it's like the
0.00%:  he's more a child
0.00%:  he worked in a
0.00%:  while I'm at it let's also
0.02%:  while I'm at it let's also give
0.02%:  while I'm at it let's also give credit
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's also give the
0.01%:  while I'm at it let's also give him
0.00%:  there's a live action
0.00%:  how did we get to where we'
0.00%:  we'll start
0.01%:  we'll start with
0.00%:  all he did was draw the
0.00%:  it's more like he's a god with
0.00%:  all I'm doing here is sc
0.00%:  this isn't how it goes
0.00%:  it's kinda hard to do
0.00%:  I'll admit it's weird
0.00%:  it was called the other
0.00%:  he's dead now; it's like
0.00%:  he's dead so we'll
0.00%:  it's made him a little less
0.00%:  I did write a
0.00%:  I'd like to get a word with
0.01%:  I'd like to get a word with him
0.00%:  it's weird how he's made
0.00%:  he's in his
0.00%:  it's more like his advice
0.00%:  we live in the same world we did a
0.00%:  let's all give him the
0.00%:  that's taken
0.00%:  it's hard to decide what's new
0.00%:  he's closer to a
0.00%:  that's so clever
0.00%:  I think he's listed more
0.00%:  I know less
0.00%:  he's more well know
0.00%:  the world we lived in was a
0.00%:  I was taking the
0.00%:  it's more like what he did was move
0.00%:  I think he's dis
0.00%:  he was still doing
0.00%:  that's a song
0.00%:  this game is over
0.00%:  I've made him this and
0.00%:  it's the second hard
0.00%:  that's weird and makes
0.00%:  it's where he gave it
0.00%:  it's more like what he did was call
0.00%:  I'm taking his
0.00%:  that's what I'd like to give
0.00%:  it's weird how we have
0.00%:  it is the latter
0.00%:  this got weird when I said
0.00%:  I asked him to give
0.01%:  I asked him to give me his
0.00%:  he still likes che
0.00%:  I've made him that; it's weird

0.00%:  he died last week and was
0.00%:  it's the world we died
0.00%:  it's these weird
0.00%:  it makes me wish I'd never called
0.00%:  it's like the last word
0.00%:  while we're at it let's look
0.00%:  we've had this in
0.00%:  it seems like we're having
0.00%:  we think he's dead!!
0.00%:  all I have is the
0.00%:  it's more like he d
0.00%:  I made him write it while
0.00%:  all I did was stick the
0.00%:  all I did was stick the words
0.00%:  he's still alive and his work was
0.00%:  this is so weird I'm kinda
0.00%:  I've heard he doesn't like dogs
0.00%:  it is the other
0.00%:  I think we'd have to go
0.00%:  this doesn't make him a great
0.00%:  it's him on the cover
0.00%:  with this new world we
0.00%:  this is what I worked
0.00%:  it's weird that I'm doing this all
0.00%:  the world we live in has some
0.00%:  I know his middle
0.00%:  I've got other
0.00%:  right now I am
0.00%:  named
0.00%:  all it did was make him rich
0.00%:  wait we'll
0.00%:  I kinda made these
0.00%:  we don't have to credit
0.00%:  sir I think we
0.00%:  the last line there was made
0.00%:  let's go with that second
0.00%:  I think it's clear we've all made the
0.00%:  as I recall the
0.00%:  wait this doesn't work we have
0.00%:  there's this cool
0.00%:  I think we've heard it

0.00%:  I've got a list
0.00%:  all the rest

0.00%:  that all makes
0.00%:  we've all grown
0.00%:  while we're at it what
0.00%:  it's the song
0.00%:  all he did was give the worst case time
0.00%:  it's this hard
0.00%:  it's weird that it
0.07%:  it's weird that it's called
0.00%:  I wish he'd won
0.00%:  I think it was me who did
0.00%:  wait I think that's weird
0.00%:  this song will make him
0.00%:  this made me lose
0.01%:  this made me lose track
0.00%:  all I've got is his sem

0.01%:  I've no idea what we'll do with
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how he gets credit
0.00%:  this makes me wish we'd gone
0.00%:  he seems to like
0.00%:  I lied there; he's still
0.00%:  all he did is make
0.00%:  this is the world we lived in; I was
0.00%:  I wish he'd made some
0.00%:  that's the second most
0.00%:  this makes me wish I went to grad

0.01%:  it's making me sad this whole
0.00%:  I've got no idea what he did!!
0.00%:  what he did is still
0.00%:  that is a weird
0.00%:  this is all more
0.00%:  he does have
0.00%:  he gets mad when I write
0.00%:  it's hard to tell whose idea
0.00%:  wait that's wrong; he died
0.00%:  I lied; it's the world we lived in 
0.00%:  I'd like to see the world we'd live in with

0.00%:  that's wrong; I was
0.00%:  I like this world and
0.00%:  that one's called
0.00%:  I don't see him listed here
0.00%:  all he did was write down the g
0.00%:  wait where'd this last
0.00%:  it doesn't work as well with these
0.00%:  all he did was write the second
0.00%:  I asked him how
0.00%:  I've gone a
0.00%:  that's the world we lived in last week; I mis
0.00%:  that's still a great
0.00%:  let's ignore all
0.00%:  this is now the world we'd
0.01%:  this is now the world we'd like
0.00%:  it's all the weird
0.00%:  he's still alive and I'm sick
0.00%:  it's more like he ch
0.00%:  I see where
0.00%:  these lines make
0.00%:  this is when I'
0.00%:  we all owe him thanks
0.00%:  it's like the same thing twice
0.00%:  it's like a word game
0.00%:  I'm glad it's still
0.00%:  what we've got here is a little
0.00%:  that's shit
0.00%:  it's kinda less
0.00%:  it makes him do
0.00%:  that's all he's good
0.00%:  it has made him so
0.00%:  he's still alive and it was
0.00%:  I lied and made this
0.00%:  it's more like video games than
0.00%:  there's a lot he
0.01%:  there's a lot he did
0.00%:  there's a lot he didn
0.00%:  I think it was called the '
0.00%:  I think it's called the word
0.00%:  while we're doing this I'd also
0.00%:  it's a video game that'
0.00%:  it's called some other things like
0.00%:  that's what it's named
0.00%:  it's hard to link
0.00%:  it makes me wonder who'
0.00%:  that's like the world we live in!!
0.00%:  I'm too
0.01%:  I'm too scared
0.00%:  he's still not dead
0.00%:  that's the wrong tim
0.00%:  we think we've got
0.00%:  there's this video game and
0.00%:  I might have wanted
0.00%:  I see what'
0.02%:  I see what's wrong
0.06%:  I see what's wrong with it
0.00%:  I can't make this go
0.00%:  we'd like to give the credit
0.00%:  his dad was more
0.00%:  I've no idea how we'd
0.00%:  the good
0.00%:  we all agree it's kind
0.00%:  he made this claim
0.00%:  all I've done is messed with the words
0.00%:  this all makes me sad
0.00%:  what I've said here is close
0.00%:  while we're at it I might as well save
0.00%:  it's still cooked
0.00%:  this is where we'd
0.00%:  I like this world the
0.00%:  I'd like to see some
0.00%:  he never did his
0.00%:  I think it's weird he's called a
0.00%:  I still like math
0.00%:  this is what we've all agreed
0.00%:  I'd like to claim the
0.00%:  there's like two things we'
0.00%:  no wait it
0.02%:  no wait it's called
0.01%:  no wait it's the
0.01%:  no wait it's called the
0.01%:  no wait it's like
0.00%:  there's some kind
0.00%:  I wrote this while adding
0.00%:  it's the second I made
0.00%:  it's over now
0.00%:  that's weird how well
0.00%:  all the great
0.01%:  all the great minds
0.00%:  I lied that was me
0.00%:  this is the most clever
0.00%:  I think that's all we've come
0.00%:  I've come to terms with this and
0.00%:  what I've said now
0.00%:  I don't see where we
0.00%:  I think he'll give
0.00%:  wait I'd like to change this
0.00%:  he's still alive; he knows
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how he was
0.00%:  I know he's alive
0.00%:  he's like the second or
0.00%:  the latter's like
0.00%:  when I said he
0.00%:  I lied and the
0.00%:  it's the kids who get
0.00%:  we call these sem
0.00%:  I did some slight
0.00%:  it's the same with all
0.00%:  it's their middle name!!
0.00%:  it's kinda weird he's a
0.00%:  I think it's their

0.01%:  I'm kinda sad that we've
0.01%:  I'm kinda sad that we live
0.00%:  there is a sem
0.00%:  I think it came
0.00%:  he made no
0.00%:  it's still kinda weird that we've made
0.00%:  that's kinda the world we'd
0.00%:  he's alive right now;
0.00%:  this made me wish I knew
0.00%:  now that I've listed his
0.00%:  he'd given the
0.00%:  it was so
0.00%:  it's what's making
0.01%:  it's what's making him
0.00%:  he's older than me
0.00%:  wait we don
0.04%:  wait we don't have
0.01%:  wait we don't call
0.01%:  wait we don't have time
0.01%:  wait we don't live
0.01%:  wait we don't have the
0.00%:  it's a riddle with

0.00%:  he's still alive so I might need
0.00%:  I've sorta
0.00%:  now I've made them
0.00%:  that's where its
0.00%:  it was his more

0.00%:  we'd like to give him
0.02%:  we'd like to give him the award
0.01%:  we'd like to give him the credit
0.00%:  there is a video

0.00%:  that seems like the world
0.11%:  that seems like the world we lived
0.01%:  that seems like the world we'
0.01%:  that seems like the world we've
0.00%:  wait that doesn't work!!
0.00%:  there's this nice
0.00%:  it's hard to make sense
0.00%:  the name is weird
0.00%:  he's dead so it's a
0.03%:  he's dead so it's a little weird how
0.02%:  he's dead so it's a little weird when

0.00%:  that seems like it'd go over
0.00%:  I'd like to give this whole
0.00%:  we gave him the doctor
0.00%:  we'll have to strike the
0.00%:  others
0.00%:  he's doing a
0.00%:  what I've said here is sem
0.00%:  this ends
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad that's how
0.00%:  I'd give him that award
0.00%:  it's worth twice
0.00%:  I still think we've made
0.00%:  I'm a little scared we've gone
0.00%:  it's also where he gave
0.00%:  this is all I'm adding
0.00%:  that might need some work!!
0.00%:  he doesn't get called the
0.00%:  he's kinda more the god
0.00%:  this will make his
0.00%:  we've agreed to call this whole
0.00%:  I think he's a dead
0.00%:  I've kinda missed
0.01%:  I've kinda missed the whole
0.00%:  that's wrong it's his
0.00%:  these words don't have
0.00%:  what I did there is call
0.00%:  it's more like he got his ideas
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what's so
0.00%:  I think it's weird we call
0.00%:  I've got this whole new
0.00%:  he'd like it with
0.00%:  it gives him like the
0.00%:  we might as well strike that
0.00%:  there's some claim
0.00%:  I don't like him at
0.00%:  I still have no idea what'
0.00%:  this is what we talked
0.00%:  this is kinda where
0.00%:  we've had it wrong all this time we
0.00%:  he's a dog
0.00%:  I'm good at
0.00%:  what I meant was he's worked
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd love to talk
0.00%:  that's what gave rise
0.00%:  wait he wrote the
0.00%:  wait I can
0.00%:  I was making this all
0.00%:  this doesn't work as well as I'd have
0.00%:  there isn't a good ac
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like we'll
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like we'll have
0.00%:  I think it's made his
0.00%:  he's dead and he'
0.00%:  it's the middle thing
0.00%:  that name might
0.00%:  it's closer to a
0.00%:  don't make me write
0.00%:  when I re
0.00%:  it's kinda clever how the two
0.00%:  wait how did I even get this
0.00%:  it's the world we wished we lived in; I
0.00%:  it's like class
0.00%:  it's read as
0.00%:  I'm making this whole world
0.00%:  he doesn't make the
0.00%:  I might like to have
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how the world
0.00%:  I have no idea how we get
0.00%:  it's more like he got mad
0.00%:  this got real
0.00%:  this is what I wanted
0.00%:  it's weird how little we
0.00%:  this is making me wish I cared
0.00%:  I don't see how we're still awake
0.00%:  I can't see him ever lik
0.00%:  it's more a dis
0.00%:  it's making him over
0.00%:  all it's done is wreck
0.00%:  he's called the '
0.00%:  we've all agreed it's his
0.01%:  we've all agreed it's his middle
0.00%:  I'd still like to have the
0.00%:  I lied; he was never
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this is still
0.00%:  the second verse is a little
0.00%:  I've got no idea what we're all
0.00%:  it's more like active
0.00%:  it's what he's more well
0.00%:  I'm still kinda glad we'
0.00%:  wait that's weird I think
0.00%:  it's also making
0.01%:  it's also making me
0.00%:  we don't call him that; I
0.00%:  it's more that he's god
0.00%:  I don't recall what'
0.00%:  what I've done is merge
0.00%:  it's him having
0.00%:  it's weird how that all
0.00%:  this is what's making me sad
0.00%:  here I'm making it
0.00%:  all I know is it's worth
0.00%:  all this time I've had
0.00%:  show me a
0.00%:  wait what's the
0.00%:  it's making the world sad
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to have some
0.00%:  I don't how
0.00%:  he never called it that;
0.00%:  there was a second
0.00%:  I'd like that last
0.00%:  I don't like this world we have made
0.00%:  he had more kids
0.00%:  we think he's still alive; we'
0.00%:  that was the wrong time
0.00%:  these are things I'm
0.00%:  it's vice
0.00%:  I'm having weird
0.00%:  this never gets said
0.00%:  that was weird how
0.00%:  it's like when the
0.00%:  it's made him kinda the
0.00%:  he did not write his
0.00%:  I think that's a weird image
0.00%:  doing the
0.00%:  it's more like I'm a child
0.00%:  it's more like I'm a child who
0.00%:  it makes him wrong
0.00%:  I made him write the song
0.00%:  it takes me
0.00%:  I'd like to change the world's view
0.00%:  it's the latter; he was
0.00%:  that clever
0.00%:  it's not clear how we get
0.00%:  it's a weird little
0.00%:  I'm sad now
0.00%:  it makes me wish that
0.00%:  I know a
0.00%:  that's all we're doing this week; we
0.00%:  it's me who writes this
0.00%:  I liked it when we
0.00%:  right now it's me
0.00%:  he's doing al
0.00%:  all that did was give me the worst
0.00%:  wait no that's like the weird
0.00%:  what he did was write '
0.00%:  what he did was write some logic
0.00%:  it's either the second
0.00%:  I think we've made it this
0.00%:  what he did was closer
0.00%:  he's still alive so it's the
0.00%:  that's a lie there's like twelve
0.00%:  he still lives and
0.03%:  he still lives and works
0.00%:  the whole world is making
0.00%:  he's alive!!
0.00%:  he's all right
0.00%:  it's kinda where he
0.00%:  let's all go home
0.00%:  I think it's weird how we've all
0.00%:  it's like this song called
0.00%:  it's a given
0.00%:  I made these claims
0.00%:  I hate to
0.00%:  don't ask me what I've
0.00%:  I think it's short
0.00%:  I'll throw
0.00%:  that made it worse; I'll
0.00%:  it's clear we've lost
0.00%:  all we've done is switch
0.00%:  I'm wrong; it was called
0.00%:  what I've got there
0.00%:  it's more like he's a math
0.00%:  I'm glad we never asked
0.00%:  while we're doing this let's leave
0.00%:  I've still gotta
0.02%:  I've still gotta write
0.00%:  I've still gotta work
0.00%:  we've called this whole
0.00%:  while I'm on this
0.00%:  he's still alive so he's kinda mad
0.00%:  it's more like I've added some
0.00%:  I don't see how he made
0.00%:  I never liked his sem
0.00%:  he's made a
0.00%:  I think he called it a
0.00%:  he did this all
0.00%:  I messed with that
0.00%:  this makes me wish I wrote
0.00%:  it's a drink called
0.00%:  it's the title I came
0.00%:  here's what I've done
0.00%:  I lied it's like the
0.00%:  I'll give credit to the
0.00%:  what I did there was talk
0.00%:  while we're at it let's have some
0.00%:  it was what he worked
0.00%:  I think he'd write
0.00%:  it's this word game
0.01%:  it's this word game called
0.00%:  what he did was cover
0.00%:  I lied in
0.01%:  I lied in the middle
0.00%:  what I'm doing here was
0.00%:  this isn't how I'
0.00%:  he wrote it while at
0.00%:  it's his work that led
0.00%:  it's all I've worked on this
0.01%:  it's all I've worked on this decade
0.00%:  I threw that in
0.00%:  he's alive and he'd
0.01%:  he's alive and he'd like
0.00%:  I've no idea what else
0.03%:  I've no idea what else he's worked
0.01%:  I've no idea what else he did
0.00%:  this doesn't seem like the most
0.00%:  he might've said it was more
0.00%:  it's got the
0.01%:  it's got the word
0.00%:  this seems like it'd have more
0.00%:  it's making it real
0.00%:  now I'm less
0.00%:  it's like right
0.00%:  who did
0.00%:  we think the word is
0.00%:  I've no idea who made him
0.00%:  I don't see what we've got here
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what this
0.00%:  it's a sketch
0.00%:  I think there's some logic
0.00%:  this is where I've come to
0.00%:  that was the world we lived in last week so
0.00%:  I think we've lost some
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how we all
0.00%:  I can't get either
0.00%:  it's kinda weird to watch
0.00%:  this is what we've done
0.00%:  he died last week; I've
0.00%:  I think he was more sem
0.00%:  it's still hard to get
0.00%:  I've still got his sem
0.00%:  while we're at this I'd like to give
0.00%:  all I did was write a song
0.00%:  what I think we'll do is we're
0.00%:  I lied; that's where
0.00%:  I've got the names
0.00%:  this has made me never
0.00%:  he named this
0.00%:  I'd like to give that
0.00%:  I think he gets all
0.00%:  there is a video game with
0.00%:  I still don't see how this rel
0.00%:  it's a dish with
0.00%:  it did get
0.00%:  I did this in
0.00%:  it's still me who's making the
0.00%:  it's all we've heard him
0.00%:  this gave me an
0.00%:  it's hard to see him
0.00%:  we made him a
0.00%:  it's more like most
0.00%:  it's his dad who made
0.00%:  I've messed with the words a
0.00%:  it's me who's the dad
0.00%:  I wrote all those things
0.00%:  we'd like to give the award to him
0.00%:  this sketch
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what he'll
0.00%:  it's more like what he's done is made
0.00%:  I think he gets a medal
0.00%:  his work got him called
0.00%:  don't read me
0.00%:  this makes me wish I did
0.00%:  I think we still get
0.00%:  he was like two
0.00%:  that's a thing I'
0.01%:  that's a thing I've
0.00%:  what's most
0.00%:  I've had like
0.01%:  I've had like three
0.00%:  it's me who's given the
0.03%:  it's me who's given the credit
0.00%:  no that's the
0.01%:  no that's the weird
0.00%:  he's dead so it's weird we
0.01%:  he's dead so it's weird we call
0.00%:  it's the second world
0.00%:  it's what's made him a
0.00%:  I wish he'd still
0.00%:  it's more like he did a whole
0.00%:  what it's given
0.01%:  what it's given him is more
0.00%:  I'd give him the credit on
0.00%:  I think it was the sem
0.00%:  he'll like
0.00%:  while he was doing
0.00%:  it does make me wish I had
0.00%:  that's review
0.00%:  I've no idea what this is like
0.00%:  either this
0.00%:  it does kinda
0.00%:  that line made me sad
0.00%:  this is more like what I'm
0.00%:  it's more middle
0.00%:  it's more middle child
0.00%:  since it's all
0.00%:  wait I think he's dead!!
0.00%:  I've come here
0.01%:  I've come here to ask
0.00%:  the words I'
0.00%:  the words I've
0.00%:  I'm glad we've had
0.11%:  I'm glad we've had this little
0.01%:  I'm glad we've had this talk;
0.01%:  I'm glad we've had this little time
0.01%:  I'm glad we've had this talk now
0.01%:  I'm glad we've had this talk; it
0.01%:  I'm glad we've had this time
0.00%:  that's like his middle name!!
0.00%:  it's hard to tell whose ideas
0.00%:  I'm scared to even
0.00%:  I've no idea what he's made
0.00%:  it makes him the one
0.00%:  I'd have to write it
0.00%:  it has!!
0.00%:  all I did was review
0.00%:  we think it was called the
0.00%:  it's more what he called
0.00%:  she writes
0.00%:  that doesn't work as well as I'd wish
0.00%:  while I'm here does
0.00%:  it's the dad
0.00%:  it's like his dad
0.00%:  it's like the world's sweet
0.00%:  I can't tell what's real
0.00%:  I wrote this at home
0.00%:  I've lied this whole time and made
0.00%:  since he's dead it's more like god
0.00%:  I think we'll avoid
0.00%:  all I know is the word '
0.00%:  that's a lie; he wrote it
0.00%:  wait this song'
0.00%:  we'll let him have
0.00%:  that's the degree
0.00%:  I'd heard the second
0.00%:  it's all made worse
0.00%:  this is the world we get
0.00%:  we've still got the award
0.00%:  wait I don't get this
0.00%:  it's like a little
0.00%:  it's talk
0.00%:  I'd like to read it
0.00%:  while we're at it I'm taking this
0.00%:  this is the worst game I
0.00%:  wait this is wrong I've made
0.00%:  I wrote this last line
0.00%:  it's more ac
0.00%:  I'll give him some credit on
0.00%:  I knew the
0.00%:  he never asked it
0.00%:  that's still more
0.00%:  all he ever asked
0.00%:  all I did here is
0.00%:  wait!! I think
0.00%:  the latter made him a
0.00%:  he's more what
0.00%:  what I'd like to solve
0.00%:  what I'd like to solve is the
0.00%:  now that we've said the words it
0.01%:  now that we've said the words it's like
0.00%:  the latter didn
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad we missed the whole
0.00%:  he's made him into
0.00%:  he's still alive and he writes good
0.00%:  wait I've read the
0.00%:  this makes me a little sad!!
0.00%:  I think he's served
0.00%:  all I've done is read the w
0.00%:  this is where I get all
0.00%:  that's shock
0.00%:  cried
0.00%:  cried when
0.00%:  I'll give him the doctor
0.00%:  we'll make
0.00%:  we're living with that
0.00%:  he was a little older
0.00%:  we've all made this world
0.00%:  I'd asked
0.03%:  I'd asked him to write
0.02%:  I'd asked him to write the
0.01%:  I'd asked him to write this
0.01%:  I'd asked him to write me
0.01%:  I'd asked him to write a
0.01%:  I'd asked him to write that
0.01%:  I'd asked him to write it
0.01%:  I'd asked him what
0.00%:  it's made him what I
0.00%:  I'll admit this song
0.00%:  it's the middle line that makes
0.00%:  we think it's all
0.00%:  that's all I've got down here;
0.00%:  I think it's a little more
0.00%:  it's still a real
0.00%:  I liked how it
0.00%:  all I've got is the word
0.00%:  I'm his
0.00%:  I'm his grand
0.00%:  we've got a whole series
0.00%:  this is a more
0.00%:  this is all I ever talk
0.00%:  there's like a whole song we
0.00%:  we'll give him an award
0.00%:  makes him a
0.00%:  he's still alive; I don't get where
0.00%:  I think he was grad
0.00%:  what I've said there is less
0.00%:  it's magic
0.00%:  all I did was tweak some
0.00%:  he doesn't decide
0.00%:  I'm losing this
0.00%:  this is the origin
0.00%:  wait we've all
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree we
0.00%:  did he write this
0.00%:  I've chosen the
0.00%:  once
0.00%:  I think we've all said more
0.00%:  come with me and I'll take
0.00%:  I think this game is over
0.00%:  it's a sh
0.00%:  no idea where I got this
0.00%:  I lied the other
0.00%:  it's when the
0.00%:  wow there's like a
0.01%:  wow there's like a whole
0.00%:  I wrote this when it
0.00%:  that was me!! I wrote
0.00%:  I think he's still alive; we'd
0.00%:  no he died like
0.00%:  I might've made those two
0.00%:  I have no idea who said
0.00%:  I had it the
0.00%:  I think he read
0.00%:  he's the same
0.00%:  we still don't give him a
0.00%:  I'm making the world
0.00%:  solved
0.00%:  it's making him do that
0.00%:  it's me who writes that
0.00%:  that's made me kinda
0.00%:  that's all we're doing this sem
0.00%:  that's how I ended
0.00%: ; it's more like he's a
0.00%:  I've got this entire
0.00%:  what he did was more like give some
0.00%:  when I wrote the
0.00%:  how did this even come
0.00%:  all I ever wanted was
0.00%:  it makes him a great
0.00%:  we don't call him that; we're like
0.00%:  it's more that he made it
0.00%:  that word was
0.00%:  it's what I did
0.00%:  it's making the world decide
0.00%:  it's more like what I said the
0.00%:  I lied there!!
0.00%:  it's sad how little we'
0.01%:  it's sad how little we've done
0.00%:  this isn't what I'm like
0.00%:  wait I'm wrong he's still
0.00%:  what I did there was less
0.00%:  we have like eight
0.00%:  the world we live in is that I'm sad
0.00%:  what he did was write two
0.00%:  the word was 'the
0.00%:  that's all the credit
0.00%:  this whole talk's made
0.00%:  he's more like the single
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad there's so
0.00%:  that's what I'm like
0.00%:  I lied he died
0.00%:  we'd still like him to come
0.00%:  we've had it all
0.05%:  we've had it all wrong this
0.01%:  we've had it all wrong;
0.00%:  we've all since agreed that it's the
0.00%:  this thing is called
0.00%:  wow that's like the weird
0.00%:  these are all made
0.00%:  now we're all dead
0.00%:  I've lied twice
0.01%:  I've lied twice there
0.00%:  it's a little weird having the
0.00%:  don't ask me how this came
0.00%:  I've no idea what he's like or
0.00%:  it's making me wish I did
0.00%:  we all agreed we
0.00%:  all I've got are some
0.00%:  I've said this three times in
0.00%:  we still have a long
0.00%:  his work led to his
0.00%:  this was like the second time
0.02%:  this was like the second time I've said
0.02%:  this was like the second time I've made
0.01%:  this was like the second time I've read
0.00%:  it's more like he's head
0.00%:  I wrote this with like
0.00%:  it's all the world we
0.00%:  it's more like he's the main
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like that's ever
0.00%:  this is the secret

0.01%:  I've still got no idea what he's said
0.01%:  I've still got no idea what he said
0.00%:  I've still got no idea what he'd
0.00%:  I've still got no idea what his
0.00%:  the whole world seems
0.00%:  I did make this
0.00%:  I lied this was the
0.00%:  let's end
0.00%:  what I said there is called
0.00%:  that's weird; he was
0.00%:  we've tried that
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that he comes
0.00%:  he liked it so
0.00%:  it's making him his
0.00%:  wait I think he made
0.00%:  all I ever did was come
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how we call
0.00%:  it's talked down
0.00%:  it's a dig
0.00%:  it's here in
0.00%:  I've got no idea what's the
0.00%:  we call the math
0.00%:  we think he's still alive so we
0.00%:  what I've said here was
0.00%:  now I've said the words twice
0.00%:  it was more like sem
0.00%:  those last two lines might
0.00%:  I'm still eating
0.00%:  it's weird he's called a
0.00%:  it's middle
0.00%:  it's middle school
0.00%:  it's middle school math
0.00%:  I've said this wrong the
0.00%:  there's a whole kind
0.00%:  that's while we're at
0.00%:  let's throw the
0.00%:  I agree with his views
0.00%:  wait there's a thing
0.00%:  he's more active with
0.00%:  it doesn't matter how he died
0.00%:  he was more asking
0.00%:  it was the same thing
0.00%:  it's he who made me
0.00%:  I've read a
0.00%:  I added the whole last
0.00%:  it made him these
0.00%:  let's have him write
0.00%:  what I meant was his
0.01%:  what I meant was his work
0.00%:  I'm making those all
0.00%:  wait he's dead so
0.00%:  this secret
0.00%:  let's not give him that award
0.00%:  all this makes me want
0.00%:  we call him one
0.00%:  it's how he made
0.00%:  i'm making this whole
0.00%:  that's me who's making
0.00%:  it's the same word twice and
0.00%:  here's what we'
0.00%:  that gave me some weird ideas!!
0.00%:  there I've
0.00%:  it's made him one the
0.00%:  it's called some other thing I've
0.00%:  this isn't where I'm
0.00%:  I think it's great we have
0.00%:  no it's all
0.00%:  I might have to write new
0.00%:  this is the world we've wanted
0.00%:  it doesn't have him
0.01%:  it doesn't have him listed
0.00%:  he's still alive; he made
0.00%:  that's real nice
0.00%:  this is all making me wish
0.00%:  it's not clear he's still
0.00%:  his is more like
0.00%:  it's almost the
0.00%:  he isn't that
0.00%:  this whole line
0.00%:  wait it's making me throw
0.00%:  what it's made him is write
0.00%:  there's no video game called that
0.00%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in at
0.00%:  he's still alive; we got
0.01%:  he's still alive; we got him
0.00%:  I'll get this
0.00%:  each word in the
0.00%:  I was wrong; it's called the
0.00%:  all we know is that he'd
0.00%:  it's more chill
0.00%:  it's all made me kinda
0.00%:  I think he died;
0.00%:  this was an
0.00%:  I have two
0.00%:  it's a little light
0.00%:  how did we even get there
0.00%:  that's kinda weird; I've
0.00%:  he tack
0.00%:  he did all this work in
0.00%:  I'm good with it either
0.00%:  it's more like he's given all
0.00%:  I'd like to watch this video
0.00%:  he never did it
0.00%:  he's still doing his
0.01%:  he's still doing his work
0.00%:  it was three weeks
0.00%:  we've called this new
0.00%:  it doesn't matter which we've killed
0.00%:  the name was added
0.00%:  he still gets a
0.00%:  it's called more like the
0.00%:  it got him the
0.00%:  we've made him a lot
0.00%:  that's the world we live in twice
0.00%:  he said he wanted
0.00%:  it's more like the single
0.00%:  having this
0.00%:  I wish he'd made it more
0.00%:  I think we have to decide
0.00%:  while we're at it I'm making the
0.00%:  I'm a little scared this
0.01%:  I'm a little scared this might
0.00%:  I think he was listed
0.00%:  all he wrote was '
0.00%:  what I've said here is total
0.00%:  their kids
0.00%:  wait do
0.00%:  that's kinda weird how well
0.00%:  it's more like his dad gave
0.00%:  there's some things we
0.00%:  we think his sem
0.00%:  this is what we did
0.00%:  it made him a little
0.00%:  the last line is a
0.00%:  I'm in love with him so
0.00%:  it's crime
0.00%:  all I did was write song
0.00%:  the whole world kinda
0.00%:  it made him that over
0.00%:  that was like his middle
0.00%:  no I was k
0.00%:  it's a crime that he didn
0.00%:  it's weird how some things
0.00%:  he's made me think
0.00%:  wait no he's like
0.00%:  it'd make more sense to have
0.00%:  I think it's called math
0.00%:  let's go with sem
0.00%:  it's not the world
0.00%:  I made that third
0.00%:  it's him or
0.00%:  I think he did call
0.00%:  I agree with the sem
0.00%:  it's still a math
0.01%:  it's still a math degree
0.00%:  how did we get to the
0.00%:  this is weird and I'd
0.00%:  it doesn't work with me
0.00%:  I've got this whole rec
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he was a
0.00%:  it's me who wrote that!!
0.00%:  I think he'll get more
0.00%:  he'd have liked
0.00%:  he'd have liked it more
0.00%:  I've got no idea what the rest
0.00%:  it's making the world less
0.01%:  it's making the world less awesome
0.00%:  I'd give him that credit
0.00%:  all it's made him is dead wrong
0.00%:  is that how
0.01%:  is that how it works
0.00%:  I wish he'd never looked
0.00%:  I lied there; he didn
0.00%:  this makes me re
0.00%:  while we're at it I'm moving
0.00%:  that's like his middle name I
0.00%:  it's still hard to know
0.00%:  it seems like we're all
0.00%:  that's where I wanted
0.00%:  while we're at it let's divide the
0.00%:  it's kinda awesome how he's called
0.00%:  it's weird how I talk
0.00%:  we all know he's there
0.00%:  I don't see how we'll ever get this idea
0.00%:  what he did was remove
0.00%:  there's two things we'
0.00%:  man I'd
0.00%:  man I'd like
0.00%:  I think the w
0.00%:  wait I'm kinda
0.00%:  that's what I'm living
0.00%:  wow that's kinda awesome
0.00%:  I've no idea who writes the
0.00%:  I might've looked this
0.00%:  it's weird that we've ended
0.00%:  what I've done is called
0.00%:  it's model
0.00%:  we don't care what he likes!!
0.00%:  he won't give
0.02%:  he won't give me credit
0.01%:  he won't give me his
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree that'd
0.00%:  it's worth a lot less
0.00%:  it's this more
0.00%:  we've got his
0.00%:  we might want to avoid
0.00%:  I think he drew it
0.00%:  we might as well make this
0.00%:  it's made him work
0.00%:  he's more like its dad
0.00%:  we're still making it
0.00%:  it's the second word I'd like
0.00%:  it's mother
0.00%:  I don't see how we're still alive;
0.00%:  the math is still
0.00%:  I don't see how that's gr
0.00%:  we know it
0.00%:  I've made that last line
0.00%:  he's like the real
0.00%:  it's made me the
0.00%:  it was more like an
0.00%:  it's kinda racist to
0.00%:  what I've done here is talk
0.00%:  it's a little weird how I'm doing the
0.00%:  all it's made him is like
0.00%:  I'd still like to see him come
0.00%:  that's a lie right
0.00%:  I think he's got more claims
0.00%:  we're done with this game
0.00%:  I've said that wrong like a
0.00%:  I write this down while
0.00%:  I've done this like twice
0.00%:  it's what made him so
0.00%:  it's the area
0.00%:  we've all agreed on the
0.00%:  what I'm doing is called '
0.00%:  it's kinda what made
0.00%:  that might've mess
0.00%:  I'll make this
0.00%:  it's a song I wrote called
0.00%:  he died last week at age
0.00%:  we added the last line there
0.00%:  all I did there was make the
0.00%:  I might have wasted
0.00%:  we called the whole
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how we've made this
0.00%:  that's wrong he's called
0.00%:  that's weird that we've
0.00%:  what I did with
0.00%:  I moved
0.00%:  it's like his second sem
0.00%:  I kinda did the
0.00%:  we've agreed to call that
0.00%:  that's wrong it makes him a
0.00%:  it's called the latter
0.00%:  this is so weird I'm kinda glad
0.00%:  I'd like to see the whole
0.00%:  it's more like he chose
0.00%:  wait a second!!
0.00%:  that's worse with
0.00%:  those were his nick
0.00%:  it's more that he's come
0.00%:  it's more like his least
0.00%:  he's dead now; he's like
0.00%:  it'd make him the grand
0.00%:  I heard it's his
0.00%:  I still don't care
0.00%:  that's a lie and
0.00%:  what's wrong with me;
0.00%:  I've added like
0.00%:  the word is a
0.00%:  it's more like the co
0.00%:  it's a weird thing he'
0.00%:  he gave his work
0.00%:  this news
0.00%:  I'd like to give that credit
0.00%:  his co
0.00%:  I think we all wish we
0.00%:  it's more a single
0.00%:  it reads like the
0.00%:  I've got this down
0.00%:  he doesn't seem like that great
0.00%:  listen I have
0.00%:  it's the weight
0.00%:  it's hard to tell this
0.00%:  while we're at it I've had
0.00%:  it made him the doctor
0.00%:  he's the most well
0.00%:  that's like the worst dad name
0.00%:  that's a lie; he did not write
0.00%:  that's made it worse
0.00%:  there's a weight
0.00%:  that'll make me
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree it was the
0.00%:  it's kinda hard to tell who came
0.00%:  it's me making the
0.00%:  he wrote a single
0.00%:  we all know he's the latter
0.00%:  the last was
0.00%:  that was me doing
0.00%:  this doesn't seem like a real
0.00%:  what I do with
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how he's got a
0.00%:  I wish he'd liked
0.00%:  we call it 'the
0.00%:  what's weird is when I
0.00%:  it's hard to see how I
0.00%:  there's two main
0.00%:  I think it's weird to give
0.00%:  it isn't clear how
0.00%:  we want
0.00%:  that's a little hard
0.00%:  what I've said here doesn't seem
0.01%:  what I've said here doesn't seem like
0.00%:  dead
0.00%:  dead wrong
0.00%:  we've all agreed his
0.00%:  I've said the same
0.23%:  I've said the same thing twice
0.02%:  I've said the same thing like
0.00%:  he did make those
0.00%:  it did have some
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad we still have other
0.00%:  that last line makes me wish we
0.02%:  that last line makes me wish we lived
0.00%:  I like this new world'
0.00%:  I lied; he's like
0.00%:  what he was doing is
0.00%:  it's the god damn
0.00%:  when I write the
0.00%:  it's all good
0.00%:  that's where it all gets
0.00%:  he likes cheese and
0.01%:  he likes cheese and gr
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad we had
0.02%:  I'm kinda glad we had this little
0.00%:  we all know he died
0.00%:  that's wrong; he's like a
0.00%:  it made him called
0.00%:  he gave his name
0.00%:  it's so great we
0.00%:  it's the head
0.00%:  we have no idea what'
0.00%:  there's a slight in
0.00%:  we've all agreed with the second
0.00%:  I'd still like to hear some
0.00%:  that makes me cringe with dis
0.00%:  wait this is all wrong I've made
0.00%:  what I did there was we
0.00%:  what he did was give sem
0.00%:  I'll need to work
0.00%:  it's making me wish I lived
0.00%:  I've made him these two
0.00%:  his work in the 
0.00%:  that's all we know so
0.00%:  it's all I can talk
0.00%:  I don't care who likes this
0.00%:  there's a whole long list
0.00%:  let's go watch movies
0.00%:  what I've done is re
0.00%:  let's come
0.00%:  I'm r
0.00%:  his middle name is still
0.00%:  it's a little weird how the second
0.00%:  it's what his work
0.00%:  it's er
0.00%:  we've agreed to call them
0.00%:  that made me want
0.00%:  it's hard to decide how well
0.00%:  the math is more
0.00%:  I kinda miss the world
0.00%:  this gives me all
0.01%:  this gives me all kinds
0.00%:  I lied there; his
0.00%:  what I did there was kinda mess
0.00%:  we've all said it
0.01%:  we've all said it wrong
0.00%:  we're still adding
0.00%:  the world doesn
0.01%:  the world doesn't make
0.01%:  the world doesn't have
0.01%:  the world doesn't live
0.01%:  the world doesn't live like
0.00%:  the world doesn't live like this
0.00%:  the world doesn't have time
0.00%:  we think we solved the
0.00%:  he made his mark
0.00%:  all I did was remove '
0.00%:  I never said we
0.00%:  we never called him this
0.00%:  allow me to clar
0.00%:  when he wrote it I'
0.00%:  we don't ever call him that;
0.01%:  we don't ever call him that; it's like
0.01%:  we don't ever call him that; we
0.00%:  this makes me sadder
0.00%:  the world we live in has like
0.00%:  he's still alive so I'm doing him
0.00%:  it's more like he sits
0.00%:  it's the world we'd like to live in!!
0.00%:  wait this is the weird
0.00%:  we call the things
0.00%:  this all gets worse
0.00%:  I'm glad this is the world we live in; most
0.00%:  while we're at it I've made him
0.00%:  it's making me sad how little I
0.00%:  I'm kinda scared this is the
0.00%:  we'll give him the award now
0.00%:  it seems like he was the
0.00%:  it's made him give
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this is what
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is what we
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is what we've
0.01%:  I'm kinda glad this is what we've come
0.00%:  we wrote that while we
0.00%:  we don't have words
0.00%:  it's more like sc
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he's got
0.00%: ; it's more like he was
0.00%:  I think there's mis
0.00%:  it leaves
0.00%:  it is his
0.01%:  it is his sem
0.00%:  he's still alive and 
0.00%:  I might've made the entire
0.00%:  it made him a great
0.00%:  I can't get the word
0.00%:  he's made some
0.00%:  it's weird how well that goes
0.00%:  all I did there is change
0.00%:  there's two things I've said
0.00%:  I'll admit his
0.00%:  it's more like the gods
0.00%:  it gave him the middle
0.00%:  the man's work
0.00%:  let's get him his own award
0.00%:  he said he was more
0.00%:  I don't like them
0.00%:  all he did was stick some
0.00%:  this is making me crave the
0.00%:  I think we've all got him
0.00%:  I hear the
0.00%:  we've all talked this
0.00%:  what it does is make
0.00%:  he's still alive and he's great!!
0.00%:  while we're at it I think we all
0.00%:  that's what I've read
0.00%:  it's a whole sem
0.00%:  that does make me wonder what
0.00%:  it's 'cook
0.00%:  his work was in logic
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like the last
0.00%:  I think he later
0.00%:  that last thing
0.00%:  he's still alive and I'm mis
0.00%:  while we're at it let's give a second
0.00%:  I wrote this w
0.00%:  that's like this weird
0.00%:  it's what we called
0.00%:  it's what we called him in grad
0.00%:  I ran
0.00%:  I've made a whole
0.00%:  this doesn't seem like it will have
0.00%:  it seems he's still
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that he'd give
0.00%:  it's a little weird how we've come this
0.00%:  what I said is wrong;
0.00%:  I think we've come a
0.00%:  it's kinda how I got
0.00%:  it's more like two sem
0.00%:  let's make this a thing
0.00%:  it's me who wrote that;
0.00%:  we never called him a
0.00%:  that's wrong; I'd like
0.00%:  it's a whole thing!!
0.00%:  we have like two
0.00%:  it'd have
0.00%:  he is more the
0.00%:  what did he solve
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how we've made
0.00%:  all I know is it's where the
0.00%:  he's done some
0.00%:  this was more a
0.00%:  now that we've said this I
0.00%:  now that we've said this I'm like
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd ask
0.00%:  it's more like he was the most
0.00%:  I have like this
0.00%:  this gives me the weird
0.00%:  I've no idea who gets
0.00%:  I'm doctor
0.00%:  he doesn't seem to care
0.00%:  this whole time I've wanted to make
0.00%:  all that's made him is older
0.00%:  while we're at it I don
0.01%:  while we're at it I don't see
0.00%:  while we're at it I don't like
0.00%:  the work is still
0.00%:  I'm done with this talk
0.00%:  wait that's wrong I mess
0.00%:  what I've done here is add
0.00%:  while we're at it let's give one
0.00%:  that last line makes me wish I were
0.00%:  wait I think he's a
0.00%:  now that we've made this world we
0.00%:  it's aw
0.00%:  it's kinda made him a
0.00%:  him and his
0.00%:  it's what we call him now
0.00%:  it's making me sad how this
0.00%:  how'd he
0.00%:  that's me; I'm the
0.00%:  it's a talk
0.01%:  it's a talk show
0.00%:  it's a talk show where
0.00%:  it's more like he's a small
0.00%:  it's more like he added a new
0.00%:  I'd still like to hear what god
0.00%:  it makes him win
0.00%:  it makes him win the
0.00%:  who cares I'm making it
0.00%:  all the work is
0.00%:  I liked how the
0.00%:  it's the least we
0.00%:  it doesn't work well as a m
0.00%:  he was more like the sem
0.00%:  let's get him some
0.01%:  let's get him some awards
0.00%:  that's all it
0.01%:  that's all it's made
0.01%:  that's all it's ever
0.01%:  that's all it's made him do
0.01%:  that's all it's ever made
0.01%:  that's all it's ever made him do
0.00%:  that's all it's made him!!
0.00%:  that's all it's ever made him!!
0.00%:  that's all it's made him so
0.00%:  I still think it
0.01%:  I still think it's more
0.01%:  I still think it'd
0.01%:  I still think it's a
0.01%:  I still think it's weird
0.00%:  that's the world we came
0.00%:  it's like other
0.00%:  all these words I
0.03%:  all these words I'm making
0.01%:  all these words I've
0.00%:  all these words I've said
0.00%:  I think there's a disc
0.00%:  it's more like he died last
0.00%:  it's the reason he got
0.00%:  he made lots
0.00%:  he's a whole
0.00%:  lives
0.00%:  he died last week so we might
0.00%:  it's more like he was in the middle
0.00%:  it's kinda tragic he
0.00%:  he died last week and we'll
0.00%:  that's weird '
0.00%:  it's closer to him
0.00%:  I might've added this line
0.00%:  wow that was kind
0.00%:  I stole all
0.00%:  I still like them
0.00%:  we don't call him that; it's worse
0.00%:  that's like a 
0.00%:  it's a little cr
0.00%:  I think he's still review
0.00%:  I still don't like the
0.00%:  that second word
0.00%:  that's his great
0.00%:  I still like him either
0.00%:  he never did a
0.00%:  this is now the world we've died
0.00%:  it was when he talked
0.00%:  we might want to leave
0.00%:  I think we've all made it worse
0.00%:  it's like where the
0.00%:  it's this work
0.00%:  that's like a word
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad we'll
0.00%:  he was dead wrong
0.00%:  that's weird; it
0.01%:  that's weird; it's making
0.01%:  that's weird; it's like
0.01%:  that's weird; it's making him
0.00%:  it was him or
0.00%:  I think we have to go
0.00%:  it's more like he was ch
0.00%:  it's still kinda weird that we've come
0.00%:  we've long called
0.01%:  we've long called him that
0.01%:  we've long called him the
0.00%:  the second is less
0.00%:  he's a card
0.00%:  wait a sec there
0.01%:  wait a sec there's like
0.00%:  I almost
0.00%:  the last line is the
0.00%:  that's not how I'd like
0.00%:  I might've messed all
0.00%:  he's dead so that's like
0.00%:  I'm wrong it was called the
0.00%:  I lied it's like the worst
0.00%:  what is the world
0.01%:  what is the world coming
0.00%:  we're having like
0.00%:  I still don't see where
0.00%:  we don't call him that we
0.00%:  the word is math
0.00%:  he's like the oldest
0.01%:  he's like the oldest living
0.00%:  I've called this wrong like
0.00%:  we've all made it clear
0.00%:  I went a
0.00%:  it's the reason he was
0.00%:  I'll go ahead and write this
0.00%:  it's more called like
0.00%:  I think we're all set with
0.00%:  we have to talk
0.00%:  he's still alive; he died two
0.02%:  he's still alive; he died two weeks
0.01%:  he's still alive; he died two weeks ago!!
0.00%:  there's a thing we
0.00%:  we've got like two
0.00%:  I did write these
0.00%:  while we're at it let's make his
0.00%:  it's more like he loved
0.00%:  it's more with the
0.00%:  I think that's more well
0.00%:  I think it's weird how we call
0.00%:  it's a single sem
0.00%:  that's like all he
0.01%:  that's like all he did
0.01%:  that's like all he's ever
0.00%:  it's the other was
0.00%:  that's kinda what I'd
0.00%:  it's a little weird how he's a god
0.00%:  what it's called is more
0.00%:  what I'd like to have
0.00%:  he's still in grade
0.00%:  it's making this worse
0.00%:  it's more like what I call
0.00%:  it's a coin
0.00%:  I write these songs
0.02%:  I write these songs while
0.00%:  as I write this we
0.01%:  as I write this we've
0.00%:  the end rh
0.00%:  I can't get his
0.00%:  this is all I came
0.00%:  we said that
0.00%:  he's more called the
0.00%:  I'd still like him more
0.00%:  I wrote down his
0.00%:  I think that's a met
0.00%:  he wrote it on
0.00%:  what he's made
0.00%:  let's give him some
0.03%:  let's give him some credit
0.01%:  let's give him some credit and
0.00%:  there's this video game I liked
0.00%: ; it's more like the
0.00%:  I lied he never talked
0.00%:  these words don't seem
0.00%:  this is where I sign
0.00%:  he was asked this
0.00%:  he's more like a middle child!!
0.00%:  let's end this right
0.00%:  it's in this
0.00%:  I think he's clever
0.00%:  he did write it
0.00%:  I've gotta write this down while
0.00%:  we all agreed this was the
0.00%:  I think he was most
0.00%:  this is like the s
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well stick some
0.00%:  while I'm down
0.00%:  what we're doing is still
0.00%:  it's a movie now
0.00%:  it's gotten
0.00%:  it's made him all kinds
0.00%:  it doesn't work as well as I wished
0.00%:  while we're taking
0.00%:  it's a title he'
0.01%:  it's a title he's given
0.00%:  that made things worse; I
0.01%:  that made things worse; I'
0.00%:  he's done work with
0.00%:  I'll admit he's the
0.00%:  it's making me eat
0.00%:  I drew a
0.00%:  there's this movie I
0.00%:  that's so weird when
0.00%:  I've read it like once
0.00%:  this all might've come
0.00%:  right now he is
0.00%:  I can't write with
0.00%:  it's more like with the
0.00%:  we hate
0.00%:  all I've read is like
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to add this song
0.00%:  he's listed third
0.00%:  what I'd like to see is him
0.00%:  I might have some work
0.00%:  it's made him the like
0.00%:  it's hit me
0.00%:  I knew that was
0.00%:  wait where's he
0.00%:  it's all I have right
0.00%:  it's he who'
0.00%:  the semi
0.00%:  I'm glad we have this time to talk since we
0.00%:  where'd all
0.02%:  where'd all this come
0.01%:  where'd all these
0.00%:  what he's done is work
0.00%:  it doesn't make him that; I was
0.00%:  I think we will
0.00%:  the world we live in is what comes
0.00%:  I'm wrong it was the
0.00%:  all he did was write that down
0.00%:  I wrote his sem
0.00%:  that reads like it's a
0.00%:  I think we still have time
0.00%:  it's like this weird song
0.00%:  it's making me decide
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this whole time
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this whole time travel
0.00%:  I know how this
0.00%:  I don't agree with a
0.00%:  all I've done is make the world'
0.00%:  there's a god who
0.00%:  there's like a song with
0.00%:  I've made that worse
0.00%:  I've heard it goes the
0.00%:  I wrote the whole last
0.00%:  sir that
0.00%:  all I've done is switch the words '
0.00%:  I can't see how we'd
0.00%:  I can't see how we'd ever
0.00%:  all that's wrong with it is
0.00%:  I think it's his age
0.00%:  I think he drew some
0.00%:  that might've made it worse; we'll see
0.00%:  that might've taken
0.00%:  he's got like the same
0.00%:  it's like a lot
0.00%:  wait he never called
0.00%:  I think we're also
0.00%:  it's the words I
0.00%:  I had the idea
0.00%:  it's kinda cl
0.00%:  he wrote in
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad the world is this
0.00%:  I don't see how there's time
0.00%:  it's a little weird how he's one
0.00%:  I'm wrong this whole
0.00%:  he's still alive and we met him
0.00%:  the titles
0.00%:  I made him write that second
0.00%:  I've got to write a
0.00%:  we'll give the other
0.00%:  I saw him at the
0.00%:  it's making him that'
0.00%:  I won
0.00%:  it's made him to
0.00%:  this is making me worse
0.00%:  I write that down
0.00%:  while we're at it I've got some ideas
0.00%:  we can't solve it
0.00%:  I think we might've made all
0.00%:  it gave him the term
0.00%:  it's named a
0.00%:  it's more like a child that'
0.00%:  I made a lot
0.00%:  man I'm tired
0.00%:  I think it will
0.00%:  that's where we come
0.00%:  what I think we've come
0.00%:  that's a little weird; we
0.01%:  that's a little weird; we'
0.00%:  it's the second time I've said this word
0.00%:  he's more the second dad
0.00%:  this is a lot
0.00%:  I've no idea who else
0.01%:  I've no idea who else might
0.00%:  while we're at it I've got a new
0.00%:  it's weird how he's called a
0.00%:  he did it a
0.00%:  it's like a word salad
0.00%:  it was more called
0.00%:  I think we've all missed some
0.00%:  I'm glad that's over;
0.00%:  it's weird to even
0.00%:  this is where I am
0.00%:  this makes me wish I'd never called it
0.00%:  I'd like to see where we
0.00%:  this makes me legit
0.00%:  it's weird that we called
0.00%:  it's weird that we called him
0.00%:  he's alive and like
0.00%:  there's legal
0.00%:  it's a giant
0.00%:  I've read it like twice!!
0.00%:  we think it was 
0.00%:  I've also made
0.00%:  that's all I wanted
0.00%:  it's the real thing
0.00%:  it's more like what he calls
0.00%:  it was more like in
0.00%:  I've had these words
0.00%:  this is the last we
0.03%:  this is the last we'll ever
0.02%:  this is the last we've
0.01%:  this is the last we ever
0.01%:  this is the last we're
0.00%:  he's given a medal
0.00%:  all I know is that he gets
0.01%:  all I know is that he gets credit
0.00%:  that makes me wish we were still in
0.00%:  I'm making this s
0.00%:  that got worse when
0.01%:  that got worse when I said
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he ever did that
0.00%:  I wrote this two
0.03%:  I wrote this two weeks
0.00%:  all I did was cover
0.00%:  all I did was cover the
0.00%:  wait it's the same word
0.00%:  it's what he named
0.00%:  it's hard to decide who makes
0.00%:  now that we've made the world
0.00%:  he can't take
0.00%:  all we know is that he wrote
0.00%:  that seems like it'd have more
0.00%:  we're doing the math
0.00%:  I might've wanted
0.00%:  wait how do
0.00%:  I might need to write this
0.00%:  I think their middle
0.00%:  this was not
0.00%:  wait I'm wrong he's the
0.00%:  that's all the more
0.00%:  this is the second time we
0.12%:  this is the second time we've talked
0.03%:  this is the second time we've made
0.02%:  this is the second time we've walked
0.01%:  this is the second time we've said
0.01%:  this is the second time we've all
0.01%:  this is the second time we've all agreed
0.00%:  more like a god
0.00%:  it's me who'll
0.00%:  it's me who'll get
0.02%:  it's me who'll get the credit
0.01%:  it's me who'll get the award
0.00%:  he made me write all
0.01%:  he made me write all this
0.01%:  he made me write all this down
0.00%:  I don't like where we
0.01%:  I don't like where we've
0.00%:  all he did was move the
0.00%:  it is this
0.00%:  there's a lot that
0.00%:  it's the latter now
0.00%:  this is me making this
0.00%:  this is the world I'm making
0.00%:  that is all
0.00%:  I'd heard that was
0.00%:  that's kinda wild
0.00%:  it's still not clear who'
0.00%:  it has made the
0.00%:  that's still making
0.01%:  that's still making him
0.00%:  this is like the world we'
0.00%:  this seems like a thing
0.00%:  it's hard to see what'
0.00%:  it's clear his
0.00%:  I lied there's like a
0.00%:  we're doing some
0.00%:  it's a whole list
0.00%:  it's kinda clear he'
0.00%:  that gives me the weird
0.00%:  I lied we're still in
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to claim the
0.00%:  it's how the
0.00%:  I'd like him to win
0.00%:  it's degree
0.00%:  he's lived since like
0.00%:  it's weird that I made
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how he called
0.00%:  that shows
0.00%:  I kinda wish we'd made
0.01%:  I kinda wish we'd made this
0.00%:  it gave him a medal
0.00%:  I'm glad we've sorted that
0.00%:  I'd ask him to sign it
0.00%:  goes
0.00%:  this is what we're living
0.00%:  it makes me wish I were dead
0.00%:  it was what he wrote
0.00%:  he died and his
0.01%:  he died and his work
0.00%:  it's more like he gets an
0.00%:  I've no idea which is worse
0.00%:  it's what makes him a
0.00%:  we needed
0.00%:  it was me who called the
0.00%:  the whole title's like
0.00%:  I think we've all agreed that it'd
0.00%:  it's more like has given
0.00%:  I think the game was
0.00%:  it's kinda how it
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how well that comes
0.00%:  it's called game
0.00%:  we've all agreed this isn't what
0.00%:  I've got some weird
0.00%:  I've got some weird ideas
0.00%:  it's also made him the 
0.00%:  that's wrong like
0.00%:  it's like in
0.00%:  all that was
0.00%:  it's shared
0.00%:  he gave me his
0.00%:  I'd give him the last
0.00%:  he said he'd like some
0.00%:  I've added all those things
0.00%:  it'll take me a while to come
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this was the world we've
0.00%:  it's more like he's a slight
0.00%:  it's great that
0.00%:  I've lost where this
0.00%:  we can't give him a title
0.00%:  it's less clever when
0.00%:  this is the worst advice
0.00%:  we've all made the world
0.00%:  he'll never get the
0.00%:  I think we'd have to add
0.00%:  I saw the movie with
0.00%:  I've got him listed
0.00%:  it's the world we lived in last week so I might'
0.00%:  give me a second while I read
0.01%:  give me a second while I read this
0.00%:  it gave him his nick
0.00%:  I lied and there is
0.00%:  I'd like to give him his own award
0.00%:  there's like a whole c
0.00%:  it's me!!
0.00%:  I might've kinda made those words
0.00%:  he doesn't make me
0.00%:  wait we're still doing the
0.00%:  I've got no idea where all
0.01%:  I've got no idea where all these
0.01%:  I've got no idea where all this is
0.00%:  what I did there was dis
0.00%:  he's not there
0.00%:  I made him look
0.00%:  I'd like to close with a verse
0.00%:  it's made him that since like
0.00%:  this is how I'm making
0.00%:  I think he was a grad
0.00%:  it's a throw
0.00%:  that doesn't work as well as I'd wished;
0.00%:  I'd kill to have
0.00%:  he's a little over
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he calls
0.00%:  I'd like to see what he calls
0.00%:  that made me weird
0.00%:  I might've read his
0.00%:  I wrote it while we
0.00%:  I'll stick with him
0.00%:  I wrote this song last
0.07%:  I wrote this song last week
0.13%:  I wrote this song last week while
0.00%:  we're all in this
0.00%:  I can't ever get
0.00%:  what I've done here is get
0.00%:  it's kinda weird he chose
0.00%:  don't give him the credit;
0.00%:  I like how that'
0.00%:  it's making it clear
0.00%:  good
0.00%:  this verse is like
0.00%:  it makes him a whole
0.00%:  it's his middle child
0.00%:  there's this video game I was
0.00%:  he's still alive and wrote this
0.00%:  I'm making the thesis
0.00%:  I heard it was called
0.00%:  we gave him this name
0.00%:  it's hard to tell who's c
0.00%:  it's more metal when
0.00%:  it doesn't work with '
0.00%:  I don't see how it's a crime
0.00%:  it's a lot easier
0.00%:  we wrote this whole
0.00%:  it's all he's got
0.00%:  that made me write down
0.00%:  the world we live in is that'
0.00%:  he's never said his
0.00%:  I think we've all agreed that is
0.00%:  we're all dead and
0.00%:  it's a little weird how he's listed second
0.00%:  it made him decide to work
0.00%:  he's still alive right now; I
0.00%:  I think it's miss
0.00%:  I think he was clever
0.00%:  I said the word twice
0.00%:  I am not
0.00%:  I still don't get how he
0.00%:  what's weird is he's not
0.00%:  we're all kinda sad
0.00%:  it's a little weird how he's coming
0.00%:  that seems more like what
0.00%:  I think we'd all agree that's some
0.00%:  more like the middle
0.03%:  more like the middle child
0.00%:  these are some
0.00%:  the world we live in's the same
0.00%:  he never said that!!
0.00%:  since that
0.00%:  it's legend
0.00%:  I think he's screw
0.00%:  it's the world's most active
0.00%:  he's still in med
0.00%:  this is made me
0.00%:  she liked
0.00%:  that was in
0.00%:  I've got no idea what he writes
0.00%:  I had no idea this
0.00%:  he died this week and we
0.00%:  it's hard to tell what we've won
0.00%:  he doesn't like it all
0.00%:  it's hard to see how we'd even get
0.00%:  the whole title's a
0.00%:  I've made him all this
0.00%:  I'd like to see the movie rights
0.00%:  I have not
0.01%:  I have not read his
0.00%:  it's the reason I'm called
0.00%:  this is the last time we
0.01%:  this is the last time we're
0.00%:  this is the last time we ever
0.00%:  I'm doing that whole
0.00%:  I'll have to go write
0.00%:  I'm wrong it's his
0.00%:  I lied; he's never asked
0.00%:  the world we live in is w
0.00%:  the world we live in is wicked
0.02%:  the world we live in is wicked awesome
0.01%:  the world we live in is wicked sweet
0.00%:  it's weird to make
0.00%:  who knows what it
0.01%:  who knows what it's called
0.00%:  I think we've missed what made
0.00%:  he's still alive!! I didn
0.00%:  I agree that
0.00%:  what it's done is screw
0.00%:  wait it's his middle
0.00%:  he might've co
0.00%:  this has made me decide I like
0.00%:  it's more like a dog
0.00%:  this gave me the will
0.00%:  it's got a whole
0.00%:  I'd like to see where this all ends
0.00%:  I don't see how we get there
0.00%:  what I'd like to see is the answer
0.00%:  he's the wrong
0.00%:  we had to write
0.00%:  all I've made him
0.00%:  all I've made him is tired
0.00%:  I like it when the
0.01%:  I like it when the words
0.00%:  he was more like an
0.00%:  it's more like we all have
0.00%:  I'm making a whole lot
0.00%:  it's clear we've all made
0.00%:  it's wrong that he
0.01%:  it's wrong that he's called
0.00%:  wow that's weird
0.00%:  this is where we've come
0.00%:  this is the last word I'm
0.00%:  it's like what he did was
0.00%:  there was this one
0.00%:  what it's done is make him old
0.00%:  what I've said there makes less
0.00%:  I'm kinda scared this whole
0.00%:  it was like the third sem
0.00%:  that's kind weird
0.00%:  some call
0.00%:  I did write the second
0.00%:  that's like a whole new
0.00%:  that's kinda weird; I'd
0.00%:  he doesn't like what I've said
0.00%:  we named the whole
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like he's solved it
0.00%:  he later said he didn
0.00%:  he's since worked
0.00%:  this is the worst new
0.00%:  it's a video game and
0.00%:  I'd like to give the award to the
0.00%:  that was more like his sem
0.00%:  while we're at it let's add in
0.00%:  while we're at it let's add in the
0.00%:  it's great that we
0.00%:  it's like this thing called a
0.00%:  we've had a while to come
0.00%:  I lied he's called
0.00%:  we live in the same world we did 
0.00%:  I think he'd give
0.00%:  what it did was give the world some
0.00%:  I'll admit this is the worst
0.00%:  I've made things worse with all
0.00%:  I'd watch the video
0.00%:  I am making the
0.01%:  I am making the whole
0.00%:  what he did is kinda
0.00%:  this is what I dream
0.00%:  that gives me a head
0.00%:  the one
0.00%:  we're all making it
0.00%:  it's more like a sl
0.00%:  I think it's time we all agreed
0.00%:  he's more like the dog
0.00%:  I think it's here
0.00%:  I think the word's '
0.00%:  it's making me wish that I were
0.00%:  that still seems like a weird
0.00%:  I think there's video game
0.00%:  I think that covers
0.00%:  I've lost what
0.00%:  it's more like he named this
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like the world
0.01%:  it doesn't seem like the world has
0.00%:  it doesn't seem like the world'
0.00%:  the link's dead
0.00%:  I did like it
0.00%:  that's made me wish
0.01%:  that's made me wish I'd never
0.00%:  that's made me wish I'd never asked
0.00%:  he's kinda cool
0.00%:  I think all he did was solve some
0.00%:  we don't do
0.00%:  I'm kinda glad this is the most
0.00%:  we're so
0.00%:  I've got to admit
0.00%:  he'd like me
0.01%:  he'd like me to clar
0.00%:  he's still alive so it's a weird
0.00%:  it's like there's some
0.00%:  I've made him that; it's wrong
0.00%:  I'm good with where
0.01%:  I'm good with where we live
0.00%:  I hate the
0.00%:  this is weird now
0.02%:  this is weird now that I've
0.00%:  it did the
0.00%:  wait there's a video
0.00%:  that's a lie; we're living
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that I've called
0.00%:  I'd ask him to come
0.00%:  it's kinda hard to tell who's sm
0.00%:  I don't get what he said
0.00%:  what he did was more like some
0.00%:  I've made it more
0.00%:  all those words came
0.00%:  I'm having a hard time lik
0.00%:  it's given him credit as
0.00%:  we do this
0.00%:  that'd make me his
0.00%:  we all know he did
0.00%:  it made him that second
0.00%:  give me a second while I re
0.00%:  I'm still doing this
0.00%:  I missed the last
0.01%:  I missed the last word
0.00%:  it's called thing
0.00%:  I lied and made it
0.00%:  it's more like he was the son
0.00%:  he's coming to
0.01%:  he's coming to visit
0.00%:  I wrote down this
0.00%:  I think we've called this
0.00%:  I gave it the
0.00%:  we think he's dead;
0.00%:  while we're at it might as well send
0.00%:  the latter is kind
0.00%:  the last line there was a
0.00%:  I've seen his work
0.00%:  I've added his
0.00%:  it's weird that we call things
0.01%:  it's weird that we call things like
0.00%:  we can't solve this with
0.00%:  I got the words
0.00%:  this whole time we've called
0.00%:  it's weird that we'd have
0.00%:  I've still got no idea what he's like as
0.00%:  it's more like he dated
0.00%:  I think he gets credit as
0.00%:  it doesn't matter how well he
0.02%:  it doesn't matter how well he did
0.01%:  it doesn't matter how well he'
0.02%:  it doesn't matter how well he's aged
0.00%:  it's where we all get
0.00%:  I've made him second
0.00%:  it's a little weird how I know these
0.00%:  this was the world we'
0.00%:  this line was added later
0.00%:  this all got weird when
0.00%:  I think the title is
0.00%:  it's clear he doesn
0.01%:  it's clear he doesn't like it
0.01%:  it's clear he doesn't like the
0.00%:  we've all done this
0.00%:  man there's like twelve
0.00%:  I've tried making it
0.00%:  that last line works
0.00%:  it's real called
0.00%:  he's kinda hated
0.00%:  this isn't that good
0.00%:  that's the worst lie I've made
0.00%:  that's h
0.00%:  he's since re
0.00%:  we'll give him more than
0.00%:  since we've got
0.00%:  it's more like he's the oldest
0.01%:  it's more like he's the oldest living
0.00%:  I've lied and made
0.00%:  that still makes me
0.00%:  he's still active right
0.00%:  it's a crime what I did
0.00%:  we've called him the god
0.00%:  it's closer to his
0.00%:  it's making me a little weird
0.00%:  there was like seven
0.00%:  I might have to kill
0.00%:  we've all agreed to stick with the middle
0.00%:  it's me who's the sem
0.00%:  I'd like to hear a
0.00%:  that's his middle name; it's like
0.00%:  it's a letter
0.00%:  that's still how
0.01%:  that's still how we
0.00%:  I've no idea where this last
0.00%:  I am making this shit
0.00%:  wait this all
0.00%:  it makes him the oldest
0.02%:  it makes him the oldest living
0.00%:  he gave it that nick
0.00%:  there can
0.00%:  he's worked at
0.00%:  we've all since agreed that he
0.00%:  it's these two things
0.00%:  we'd have to call
0.01%:  we'd have to call him
0.00%:  while we're at it these
0.00%:  no wait the
0.00%:  this is all a lie I
0.00%:  it's the world we kinda
0.01%:  it's the world we kinda lived
0.00%:  what he did makes
0.00%:  all I've got is like
0.00%:  it's never talked
0.00%:  it's more like he's the two
0.00%:  he's still alive so he gets kinda weird
0.00%:  we don't have a word like
0.00%:  I've made that right
0.00%:  her name
0.00%:  I'd still like him to decide
0.00%:  it seems like he wrote
0.00%:  this is the least well
0.00%:  it was his work that led
0.00%:  I added the last eight
0.00%:  it seems like what
0.01%:  it seems like what he did was come
0.01%:  it seems like what he did was solve
0.00%:  it's not clear he's a
0.00%:  it's more like he adm
0.00%:  I'm glad we're on
0.01%:  I'm glad we're on this
0.01%:  I'm glad we're on the same w
0.00%:  while we're at it I want
0.00%:  we all know he's the god
0.00%:  that's weird I'
0.00%:  I'd like to see this award
0.01%:  I'd like to see this award given
0.00%:  that was him making
0.00%:  it's made his kids
0.01%:  it's made his kids rich
0.00%:  it's kinda hot
0.00%:  did that
0.00%:  I think we all agree it was
0.00%:  I've named him that
0.00%:  it's making me wish that we'd all
0.00%:  it's his middle name;
0.00%:  it's more like he was a sem
0.00%:  he's lived since the
0.00%:  I'm not clear how we
0.00%:  this makes me love
0.00%:  this song made
0.01%:  this song made him
0.01%:  this song made me write
0.00%:  it makes him great
0.00%:  it's given him the middle
0.00%:  I still think he's made
0.00%:  the world we live in is he
0.00%:  it's more like mild
0.00%:  it's more like all he
0.05%:  it's more like all he did was come
0.04%:  it's more like all he did was give
0.03%:  it's more like all he did was give the
0.00%:  it's more like all he did was change
0.00%:  I'd like the last
0.00%:  that's all I've read so
0.00%:  I think he reads
0.00%:  he can't get
0.00%:  all he ever did was get
0.00%:  it's called tree
0.00%:  this is where we've all
0.00%:  that reads like g
0.00%:  the math is kind
0.00%:  it's weird that we have to
0.00%:  we all know him more
0.00%:  he did some math
0.00%:  I kinda messed that rh
0.00%:  this one's weird
0.00%:  it's like the second ever
0.00%:  I think it was called more
0.00%:  we've all agreed that's the nick
0.00%:  it's kinda sad there
0.00%:  this is more like what I've
0.00%:  it's the whole title
0.00%:  it makes him the worlds
0.00%:  we call him the master
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that we'll
0.00%:  this middle
0.00%:  while he did come
0.00%:  all I'm doing here is m
0.00%:  he was good
0.00%:  I'm still kinda h
0.00%:  his real name might
0.00%:  I'd like to read that
0.00%:  the world we live in is heck
0.00%:  it makes me the
0.00%:  it's less clear who'
0.00%:  we can't have
0.00%:  what I've said there is so
0.00%:  we've all said this wrong
0.00%:  we're a little h
0.00%:  I don't see the word
0.00%:  it's kinda got me
0.00%:  it's given him a lot more
0.00%:  what it's made him is listed
0.00%:  that's a rh
0.00%:  this is like the worst I
0.01%:  this is like the worst I've done
0.00%:  it's hard to even tell
0.00%:  what he did was solve like
0.00%:  we stole
0.00%:  that's all the words we
0.00%:  all I've got is this sketch
0.00%:  it doesn't make as
0.00%:  I messed with the tim
0.00%:  no wait that makes
0.00%:  it's made him their
0.00%:  that's a little weird given how we
0.00%:  he's still alive and asked me to write
0.00%:  I think he came to
0.00%:  what it's done is give his
0.00%:  I've heard he doesn't like it all
0.00%:  let's all take
0.00%:  this is a gross
0.00%:  that last line was weird
0.00%:  it's making me ill
0.00%:  the real thing
0.00%:  I might've kind
0.00%:  this is how I know
0.00%:  the world we live in's awesome
0.00%:  he's never asked me what'
0.00%:  I gave him credit
0.00%:  we do live in this world!!
0.00%:  we go
0.00%:  he's still alive; it's great
0.00%:  he was given his doctor
0.00%:  while we're at it this song is called
0.00%:  that's all the verse I'
0.00%:  now that we've all agreed we
0.00%:  wait what's wrong with it
0.00%:  I think he calls it '
0.00%:  while we're at it might as well do some
0.00%:  let's go ahead and strike
0.00%:  there's kids
0.00%:  wait how did we end
0.00%:  I will take credit
0.00%:  writes the
0.00%:  he's still alive and he writes code
0.00%:  no it's more like his
0.00%:  no it's more like his sem
0.00%:  he's held
0.00%:  this was a little weird
0.00%:  it's hard to decide who I'
0.00%:  it's gone over well with the ladies
0.00%:  we've all agreed to stick with this new
0.00%:  that's weird; he's like
0.00%:  it's like he didn
0.00%:  that's a verse
0.00%:  this doesn't make as
0.00%:  it's still the old
0.00%:  he was never called the
0.00%:  it's more like the wh
0.00%:  we live in the same world we did last week!! I
0.00%:  this is wrong; I've
0.00%:  that entire
0.00%:  he's still alive and he's got more
0.00%:  that last line gives me weird ch
0.00%:  it's a crime what I've done to the
0.00%:  he's still alive so I'd stick
0.00%:  what he did was write down most
0.00%:  all I did was give his
0.00%:  I've gotten ahead
0.00%:  his views
0.00%:  all it did was show
0.00%:  I'm aware that this
0.00%:  it's more like the child'
0.02%:  it's more like the child's game
0.00%:  it's more like the child's song
0.00%:  it's weird how he's a
0.00%:  it's the second with
0.00%:  we might have to stick
0.00%:  I was the one who did
0.00%:  we all agree that his
0.00%:  it's clear that we've gone
0.00%:  it's three sem
0.00%:  that's still like the
0.00%:  I'm making this world
0.00%:  what I'm doing is write
0.00%:  we're all thank
0.00%:  I might have to write some new
0.00%:  it's like that movie with
0.00%:  all I did was merge the titles
0.00%:  that's so clever I might
0.00%:  he's still alive and did more
0.00%:  what I did was merge
0.00%:  what I did was merge the
0.00%:  I still think it's hard
0.00%:  it's kinda great we
0.00%:  I still don't get this
0.00%:  I never did like the
0.00%:  it was like the worst thing
0.00%:  it's more like these two
0.00%:  that's their middle name!!
0.00%:  he's a giant dick
0.00%:  this is making me wish we were all
0.00%:  he wishes
0.00%:  this word salad is making
0.00%:  wait let me re
0.00%:  this is what we're called
0.00%:  I think we've all sort
0.00%:  it's more a middle
0.02%:  it's more a middle child
0.01%:  it's more a middle child thing
0.00%:  it's kinda a clever
0.00%:  I think it's all we
0.01%:  I think it's all we've
0.00%:  no it has
0.00%:  all it did was set
0.00%:  that's all I've got like
0.00%:  I've heard it said he
0.00%:  there's this video game I want
0.00%:  I wrote that last line while we
0.00%:  it doesn't seem right
0.00%:  we mis
0.00%:  we might as well rename it
0.00%:  I think these two
0.00%:  it's the same word with two
0.00%:  it's not clear who likes
0.00%:  we've had the title
0.01%:  we've had the title wrong
0.00%:  there's a legend
0.00%:  I've no idea how well that sc
0.00%:  all he did was take some
0.00%:  their name was
0.00%:  it doesn't make him a '
0.00%:  this is me rec
0.00%:  he's dead; it was
0.00%:  right now it's all
0.00%:  we don't have time to read the
0.00%:  he's dead so it's weird to call him like
0.00%:  that seems like it'd have come
0.00%:  he'd get the
0.01%:  he'd get the credit
0.01%:  he'd get the award
0.00%:  that's a lie; it's the world
0.09%:  that's a lie; it's the world we lived
0.00%:  he's more like a middle child I
0.00%:  it's kinda how he's viewed
0.00%:  he's the reason
0.00%:  he's the reason we
0.00%:  that's a term
0.00%:  it's more like the dad who gave
0.00%:  he never asked what
0.00%:  it's tech
0.00%:  he's still alive and works as
0.00%:  I'm glad we had this talk; it's time
0.00%:  this is the last time we'll ever make
0.00%:  I think there's a logic
0.00%:  he'd call
0.00%:  it's hard to listen
0.00%:  it's a clever little
0.00%:  I wrote this last line while
0.00%:  what I did there was lied
0.00%:  I might rename
0.00%:  now I've heard this
0.00%:  this is where it goes down
0.00%:  I asked him and
0.00%:  that's making him worse
0.00%:  I won't lie
0.00%:  we call it god
0.00%:  what he did was mat
0.00%:  I'm kinda sad this is where we live
0.00%:  he's still alive so get
0.00%:  it's this middle
0.00%:  this has all gone
0.00%:  that last line is made
0.00%:  we called him a
0.00%:  wait we've gotta
0.00%:  he's got like three co
0.00%:  I've made him that; we
0.01%:  I've made him that; we're still
0.00%:  he did make a
0.00%:  it's the second time I've said his
0.00%:  that seems like it'd get
0.01%:  that seems like it'd get him
0.00%:  it's like a movie where
0.00%:  his name's more like '
0.00%:  man it's like the worst
0.00%:  we all agree that the second
0.00%:  the world we live in is what we'd
0.01%:  the world we live in is what we'd get
0.00%:  the whole world's making
0.00%:  it's more like he showed we
0.00%:  it's a little weird how we named
0.00%:  it's more like he's dead and the
0.00%:  he told me this
0.00%:  he told me this was
0.00%:  it's more like he's the dads
0.00%:  it has had
0.00%:  it's his middle name I
0.00%:  got
0.00%:  he died last week; I was
0.00%:  wait we don't call them
0.00%:  now that we've raised
0.00%:  he never did ask me what
0.00%:  the letter
0.00%:  it's the world I'd live
0.00%:  that's some clever
0.00%:  I made it the
0.00%:  I don't agree with this claim
0.00%:  let's cross
0.00%:  I think he's a weird
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how little credit
0.01%:  it's kinda sad how little credit he'
0.00%:  I think it's w
0.00%:  that's all I've got here is
0.00%:  it's what he did on
0.00%:  I made him all
0.00%:  it might've come later
0.00%:  he is more like
0.00%:  I've kinda messed with
0.01%:  I've kinda messed with the word
0.00%:  he's dead now so it's like the
0.00%:  he was still alive when I wrote it
0.00%:  I think we've met
0.00%:  that's his degree in
0.00%:  it's a school
0.00%:  it's kinda sweet how we all
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that we got
0.00%:  I think we all agreed that
0.00%:  I think we all agreed that'
0.00%:  it's called ver
0.00%:  it doesn't make him that I
0.00%:  it's more like he's dads
0.01%:  it's more like he's dads with
0.00%:  I might still have made
0.00%:  that's all we wrote
0.00%:  it's kinda weird how I've got this all
0.00%:  the world we live in got
0.00%:  this makes the world a
0.00%:  it's more like she's the
0.00%:  more his
0.00%:  we're the ones who'
0.00%:  what I've said there doesn't seem
0.00%:  what I've said there doesn't seem like
0.00%:  he's alive and wrote the
0.00%:  I like the song
0.00%:  I'd like to get this over
0.01%:  I'd like to get this over with as
0.01%:  I'd like to get this over with and
0.00%:  it's made him get his
0.00%:  we tend
0.00%:  it's making him a world
0.00%:  all I did was change the words 'time
0.00%:  we've almost
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what he was
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well edit
0.00%:  I'd like to give him this
0.00%:  that's like one
0.00%:  we still have like a decade
0.00%:  it's a little less awesome
0.01%:  it's a little less awesome when
0.00%:  we do have some
0.00%:  I'm having words
0.00%:  I'll admit that's kind
0.00%:  it's worth twice the
0.00%:  I'll give him this
0.00%:  we leave
0.00%:  we're all named
0.00%:  it all came
0.00%:  it doesn't have me
0.00%:  the title was the
0.00%:  it's lived
0.00%:  that makes me cringe;
0.00%:  we have to throw
0.00%:  this was never the
0.00%:  it seems like he came
0.00%:  while we're doing this let's make a
0.00%:  these were his two
0.00%:  it's kinda her
0.00%:  it's their whole
0.00%:  I have no idea who is
0.00%:  this was the world we lived in last week!! I
0.00%:  it's a little wrong
0.00%:  I kinda messed the words
0.00%:  it has made him dead
0.01%:  it has made him dead wrong
0.00%:  it's a little weird how he's given a
0.00%:  I'd like to see what's wrong
0.01%:  I'd like to see what's wrong with it
0.00%:  he called it more like
0.00%:  I'm making this a
0.00%:  what it did was give him some new
0.00%:  it's me who's making all the
0.00%:  this was the second
0.01%:  this was the second time
0.01%:  this was the second time I've said
0.01%:  this was the second time I've made
0.01%:  this was the second time I've read
0.00%:  this was the second time I've tried
0.00%:  this was the second time I've worked
0.00%:  he's still alive so that's a
0.01%:  he's still alive so that's a weird
0.00%:  I'd never call them
0.00%:  it's hard to live
0.00%:  the latter thing
0.00%:  I kinda made these words
0.00%:  it's more like a middle child that was
0.00%:  we don't all have
0.00%:  it's more like cl
0.00%:  we all agree that's the most
0.00%:  there's now this
0.00%:  what I'd like most is a
0.00%:  it was co
0.00%:  all the others
0.00%:  his middle name is there
0.00%:  which is a
0.00%:  we'll make him
0.00%:  I'm good thanks
0.00%:  let's ignore this whole
0.00%:  I'd like to die
0.00%:  I'd like to die right
0.00%:  I've heard he doesn't like sweet
0.00%:  the last is wrong
0.00%:  it was his whole
0.00%:  it's kinda gross I
0.00%:  that's credit
0.00%:  it's hard to even talk
0.00%:  it's more what I'
0.00%:  I lied last
0.00%:  when I read this it made
0.00%:  that's dead wrong;
0.00%:  it's weird how it's called the
0.00%:  I think we've made the same
0.00%:  we might want to switch
0.00%:  there's a woman
0.00%:  that's cl
0.00%:  it does seem weird that
0.00%:  this made me write this song
0.00%:  it's worked well
0.00%:  all I know is that he's old
0.00%:  it's more that we call
0.01%:  it's more that we call him
0.00%:  it's weird that I'm making a
0.00%:  it was called some other things like
0.00%:  this doesn't make it
0.00%:  this doesn't work as well as a
0.01%:  this doesn't work as well as a lim
0.00%:  he's dead now so we've
0.00%:  all I know is that he's awesome
0.00%:  this makes me wonder what I
0.00%:  I think he gets called '
0.00%:  it's a little weird I'm having
0.00%:  wait it's me
0.01%:  wait it's me who
0.01%:  wait it's me who's the
0.01%:  wait it's me who's made
0.00%:  wait it's me who wrote
0.00%:  I'd give him the entire
0.00%:  I've got no idea what he'd
0.00%:  it makes me a
0.00%:  the world's kind
0.00%:  we'll give him the title and
0.00%:  I'm still making these
0.00%:  it's like there's two things
0.01%:  it's like there's two things called
0.00%:  we've all agreed that it'd
0.00%:  man it's called
0.00%:  while we're at it I've got his
0.00%:  this is where I knew
0.00%:  what I think we were
0.00%:  now I'm scared
0.00%:  I've added the last line right
0.00%:  it's their dad
0.00%:  it was made in
0.00%:  I don't like this world that we've made;
0.00%:  this new world makes him
0.00%:  it's me who's talked
0.00%:  he likes nachos more
0.00%:  I kinda wish we'd come
0.00%:  it's not clear how well he did
0.00%:  what he did was stick some
0.00%:  he's more like the single dad
0.00%:  that's all we've got down
0.01%:  that's all we've got down here
0.01%:  that's all we've got down there
0.00%:  he was good with
0.00%:  I think it was hard
0.00%:  it's weird how I know these
0.00%:  we'll have to make him
0.00%:  it's a video game now!!
0.00%:  here he
0.00%:  he's dead and his work was
0.00%:  it's a little weird how we give
0.00%:  that's kinda how we came
0.00%:  I gave him the last
0.00%:  does this
0.00%:  I'm kinda sad this is the world we all
0.00%:  I've now made it
0.00%:  he's dead and there
0.01%:  he's dead and there's like
0.01%:  he's dead and there's like two
0.00%:  he's dead and there's like twelve
0.00%:  I've no idea how that'
0.00%:  it's kinda weird he called the
0.00%:  how does he like
0.00%:  he's kinda the god
0.00%:  I'd like to see him answer the
0.00%:  he was called this
0.00%:  that's a lie; his sem
0.00%:  I'm not well read
0.00%:  I'm adding these
0.01%:  I'm adding these words
0.00%:  now we've
0.00%:  it's his worst
0.00%:  I might've said the second
0.00%:  wait that's wrong his
0.00%:  wait that's wrong his middle
0.00%:  that's a lie; he's a
0.00%:  while we're at it I'd like to add some things
0.00%:  he has more like
0.00%:  I've heard it's good
0.00%:  this is where I've gotta
0.00%:  he lives in a
0.01%:  he lives in a world
0.00%:  we still don't have a solid
0.00%:  that was less
0.00%:  we call him that over
0.00%:  it's kinda weird to call him the
0.00%:  it's given him like 
0.00%:  it's a weird ac
0.00%:  wait a second this makes
0.00%:  review
0.00%:  while we're at it let's make the second
0.00%:  this was the entire
0.00%:  I think we all agree it's this
0.00%:  it's hard to tell who is making
0.00%:  we messed with the tim
0.00%:  let's read
0.00%:  it's nick
0.00%:  that's more like what I said
0.00%:  I shit
0.00%:  it's more that he's gained
0.00%:  I'll have to write some
0.00%:  it's more his ideas
0.00%:  wait he's never called
0.00%:  now I've said them
0.00%:  we still don't have a great
0.00%:  it's all a secret
0.00%:  I wrote this while living
0.00%:  it's he who gave
0.00%:  his was
0.00%:  we've all agreed it's this
0.00%:  it's like worth
0.00%:  it's n
0.01%:  it's nicer
0.00%:  it's made him get his own
0.00%:  we're doing well with this
0.00%:  what I'm doing here is im
0.00%:  it hadn
0.00%:  I don't get how we're alive with
0.00%:  all right
0.00%:  it's more that he kinda
0.00%:  I can't write it like
0.00%:  it's making me sad that this
0.01%:  it's making me sad that this world
0.00%:  it's clear I need
0.00%:  I'd meant
0.00%:  it has like three
0.00%:  all it did was get his
0.00%:  it made him wrong
0.00%:  we've come this
0.00%:  that's what I worked
0.00%:  this was the world we lived in last week; I got
0.00%:  it's kinda weird that we'd all
0.00%:  what it's done is he
0.01%:  what it's done is he's made
0.01%:  what it's done is he's made me write
0.00%:  this gives me some weird ideas
0.00%:  these are his kids
0.00%:  this idea has
0.00%:  that's not his real
0.01%:  that's not his real middle
0.00%:  he did it right
0.00%:  made him the world's oldest
0.00%:  that's where most
0.00%:  that's all I've got when
0.00%:  I wrote this thesis
0.00%:  now it's made
0.01%:  now it's made him the
0.00%:  we made him a doctor
0.00%:  we'd still like a
0.00%:  his thesis is more
0.00%:  we never called him a god
0.00%:  let's see how
0.01%:  let's see how this works
0.00%:  he died last week; his sem
0.00%:  we're making all that
0.00%:  all that's there'
0.00%:  it's weird that we all know
0.00%:  that's a hell
0.00%:  that's more like how it'
0.00%:  all he did was claim
0.00%:  it makes me wonder what the odds
0.00%:  what I'm making
0.00%:  it's a video game this
0.00%:  that's wrong; it's like a
0.00%:  while we're at it we might as well add me
0.00%:  I messed that whole
0.00%:  it's making me wish I'd solved that
0.00%:  that's all he ever did;
0.00%:  I lied; it's all
0.00%:  that doesn't work; he
0.01%:  that doesn't work; he's called
0.01%:  that doesn't work; he's still
0.02%:  that doesn't work; he's still alive
0.01%:  that doesn't work; he's dead
0.00%:  he's still alive right now; I'
0.00%:  how'd that last line get
0.00%:  it's a little weird he's the
0.00%:  we all agree he's not
0.00%:  what it's done is get him awards
0.00%:  he's still alive so he's weird
0.00%:  what he wrote down is
0.00%:  I think we've got him listed
0.00%:  I kinda made them
0.00%:  it's all a lie I
0.00%:  taking
0.00%:  wow this is a great
0.00%:  I've short
0.00%:  I think we'll have it
0.00%:  while we're in the middle
0.00%:  the same thing is
0.00%:  in case it
0.00%:  what he did was worse
0.00%:  what's the world'
0.00%:  I think her
0.00%:  while we're at it let's end
0.00%:  when it'
0.00%:  all I did was change the word 'lik
0.00%:  I wished
0.00%:  it's kinda hard to tell whose
0.00%:  that song's weird
0.00%:  kinda weird
0.00%:  I've heard it's kind
0.00%:  he's dead; he'
0.00%:  these last lines
0.01%:  these last lines were
0.00%:  there's a movie coming with
0.00%:  we think he gets
0.00%:  he called this work
0.00%:  this is the world we've come
0.00%:  all I know is that he's great
0.00%:  it's this weird song
0.00%:  the doctor is dead
0.00%:  his title's more
0.00%:  it's more like he made a slight
0.00%:  I'm seeing some
0.00%:  let's agree this
0.00%:  all I did was switch the words 'like
0.00%:  it's the worst kind
0.00%:  we can talk
0.00%:  that's wrong it's all
0.00%:  let's agree that'
0.00%:  that's so great
0.00%:  he's worked a little with
0.00%:  I'd still like to see some
0.00%:  this doesn't make a great
0.00%:  that last line was like
0.00%:  it's made him the two
0.00%:  I think he's sm
0.00%:  while we're at it I might as well win
0.00%:  I'm glad we're done with that talk
0.00%:  it's the worst thing we
0.00%:  it's the worst thing we've all
0.00%:  it's a go
0.00%:  it's weird I know him
0.00%:  it's the two words
0.00%:  that's where it gets kinda
0.00%:  he said he liked ste
0.00%:  I'll admit this is a
0.00%:  I know it's all
0.00%:  what I know is
0.00%:  we'll have to ask
0.00%:  he's still alive; he won't die
0.00%:  we have to write this
0.00%:  I think we've tried this
0.00%:  I think it's more with
0.00%:  wait he's not dead right
0.00%:  I think we've all added
0.00%:  this writes
0.00%:  he's right now like
0.00%:  that's what led
0.00%:  that's a lie; I made him
0.00%:  it's a hor
0.00%:  it's more like a shell
0.00%:  all it's done is make him older
0.00%:  that's how we come
0.00%:  no wait there's this
0.00%:  it's like the second verse
0.00%:  this one's more
0.01%:  this one's more like
0.00%:  it's the reason we've made
0.00%:  all I did was switch two
0.00%:  there's now a whole
0.00%:  what he did was write down some little
0.00%:  it's weird how this went
0.00%:  it's made him all three
0.00%:  here's the c
0.00%:  I don't agree with him at
0.00%:  it's there'
0.00%:  I can't see how this will work
0.00%:  that's still him
0.00%:  I've asked him to write this
0.00%:  that's who I'
0.00%:  that makes me wonder who'd
0.00%:  what's weird is that we've made
0.00%:  I'd still like to read
0.00%:  right now it's the
0.00%:  there's still time to add
0.00%:  I'd kill to see him
0.00%:  it's math right
0.00%:  I'll let him give the credit
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how we're still
0.00%:  it's more like dads
0.00%:  I've tried this whole
0.00%:  it's more like he's the dad!!
0.00%:  he's done more with
0.00%:  I hate this new world;
0.00%:  it's kinda how he's come
0.00%:  this seems like a worse
0.00%:  he was an
0.00%:  I've made some alter
0.00%:  wait this is weird
0.00%:  he's still alive and was more
0.00%:  there's video games called this
0.00%:  we're kinda glad this
0.00%:  what's weird is that we've come
0.00%:  it's more like he was made
0.00%:  I hate how
0.00%:  we don't all agree with him
0.00%:  he's more like a middle son
0.00%:  it's a dread
0.00%:  we call it things
0.00%:  it's more like when he died
0.00%:  the word I meant
0.00%:  the word I meant was '
0.00%:  I'd like a second
0.00%:  I don't have the skill to write
0.00%:  it's hard to decide what level
0.00%:  it seems like I might
0.01%:  it seems like I might have screw
0.00%:  I lied he never called
0.00%:  how does this
0.00%:  we've no idea what the
0.00%:  it'd make a
0.00%:  let's go with the middle
0.00%:  that's a lie; it's more
0.00%:  he might've died since
0.00%:  I'd like to review that
0.00%:  this is all we have
0.01%:  this is all we have time
0.00%:  there's like a whole long
0.00%:  it's kinda sad how the world
0.00%:  I sing
0.00%:  he's dead so it's a little weird!!
0.00%:  that song is called
0.00%:  all he did was derive a
0.00%:  the thing I like
0.00%:  that line was weird
0.00%:  he made me write that last
0.00%:  it's clear he's a
0.00%:  it's great how this
0.00%:  I think he's real mad
0.00%:  it's great how he
0.00%:  all I said there
0.00%:  he's so well
0.00%:  I call the
0.00%:  it's still me who gets to decide
0.00%:  that seems like it's worth
0.00%:  it's more like civil
0.00%:  it's a shame we didn
0.00%:  I can't write a
0.00%:  this is all awesome
0.00%:  what I did there was kill
0.00%:  I'm kinda mess
0.00%:  we're all sick
0.00%:  that's kinda weird that I
0.01%:  that's kinda weird that I'
0.01%:  that's kinda weird that I've
0.00%:  I lied; there is
0.00%:  this is the world I've made
0.00%:  it's like that's the
0.00%:  it's not clear what he's made
0.00%:  it's this video game with
0.00%:  what it did is change
0.00%:  his kids named it
