   7277 11.18%:  think you found the secret to being correct
   7278 11.18%:  guess that would be one theory of
   7279 11.18%:  think we should all agree to
   7280 11.18%:  think that would count as an
   7281 11.18%:  need to talk to you about all this before

   7532 10.85%:  should totally write that on a science book
   7533 10.85%:  would like to be the first to say not gonna
   7534 10.85%:  think we just figured out not only are
   7535 10.85%:  need to start talking about science before you!!

   7537 10.84%:  really need to figure out a counter to this!!
   7538 10.84%:  really need to write that book before the
   7539 10.84%:  think we just figured out the reason a
   7540 10.84%:  would like that to be the case in general

   9423 9.31%:  think you just created a new reason to go
   9424 9.31%:  thought it was because
   9425 9.31%:  guess that would account for the anti
   9426 9.31%:  would like that to be the case if only because no current
   9427 9.31%:  really need to think about that one less
   9428 9.31%:  could totally see that being true because how

   9430 9.31%:  need to talk to you about whether or
   9431 9.30%:  could totally see that working because of
   9432 9.30%:  can barely breathe right now just
   9433 9.30%:  need to talk to you about science at
   9434 9.30%:  would like to be the first one to share
   9435 9.30%:  think we should totally ignore
   9436 9.30%:  think you just changed all our beliefs on a
   9437 9.30%:  would like that to be the case only for
   9438 9.30%:  should write a book about that but only
   9439 9.29%:  just figured out the science that
   9440 9.29%:  think you just created real giants for
   9441 23.03%:  think you just created real giants for the
   9442 9.29%:  would like this to be the case but cannot
   9443 9.29%:  could totally see that being fake!!
   9444 9.29%:  think you just said the one
   9445 20.23%:  think you just said the one true
   9446 9.28%:  would like that to be true real fast!!
   9447 9.28%:  need to write this book faster
   9448 9.28%:  need to think about this for way longer to rule
   9449 9.28%:  think we just found the only logical
   9450 9.28%:  cannot breathe right now because you stole
   9451 9.27%:  think you figured out a
   9452 11.30%:  think you figured out a better
   9453 32.27%:  think you figured out a better reason
   9454 46.40%:  think you figured out a better reason than
   9455 22.58%:  think you figured out a better answer

   9457 9.27%:  think you figured out the reason we all
   9458 9.27%:  really need to get on this book
   9459 9.27%:  need to talk to you about other
   9460 9.27%:  think we found the secret to being correct
   9461 9.27%:  really need to figure out how to sue
   9462 9.27%:  need to write this fan
   9463 9.27%:  need to go think about this because really
   9464 9.27%:  would say that is not
   9465 9.26%:  think you just created another reason we built
   9466 9.26%:  think you just created the science of our era
   9467 9.26%:  need to write a book about this or else there
   9468 9.26%:  thought you said it was fake
   9469 9.26%:  need to talk to you about the science for a sec!!
   9470 9.26%:  need to get on this theory like a
   9471 9.26%:  need to go think about all the reasons we
   9472 9.26%:  really need to think about that one so
   9473 9.26%:  think that could really be true because
   9474 9.26%:  need to think about this a lot now!!
   9475 9.25%:  should write a book about that for re
   9476 9.25%:  think you found the secret to a long career
   9477 9.25%:  need to get back to the library because this one
   9478 9.25%:  need to check this out because it

   9480 9.25%:  think you just ruined that one for real!!
   9481 9.25%:  would like that to be true if only because not
   9482 9.25%:  need to talk to you about science for a sec!!
   9483 9.25%:  really need to write that into a book or
   9484 9.25%:  should write a book about it then because
   9485 9.25%:  could totally see that working for a
   9486 100.36%:  could totally see that working for a science
   9487 9.24%:  totally should write about
   9488 14.78%:  totally should write about this!!
   9489 13.16%:  totally should write about this on
   9490 9.24%:  need to think about that for science because
   9491 9.24%:  really should write that book sooner!!
   9492 9.24%:  need to think about this a lot longer before we rule
   9493 9.24%:  think we just found the real secret to being a bro
   9494 9.24%:  think you should get out of science real
   9495 9.24%:  really need to figure out how to not be such a ske
   9496 9.24%:  think you just threw out a science fact
   9497 9.24%:  need to go think about that science for
   9498 9.24%:  thought it was totally fake!!
   9499 9.24%:  think we just found out the last
   9500 9.24%:  need to get back to you on this one because it blew
   9501 9.23%:  think you just won the science for
   9502 9.23%:  need to think about this alone before
   9503 9.23%:  just figured out another reason that
   9504 9.23%:  think we found the secret to being a cool
   9505 9.23%:  would like to be the first one to burst
   9506 34.38%:  would like to be the first one to burst your
   9507 9.23%:  should write a book about that being true
   9508 9.23%:  think you figured out how to contact al
   9509 9.23%:  really thought it was because of
   9510 9.23%:  think you just blew the entire case for our
   9511 9.23%:  think you just found the logical
   9512 9.79%:  think you just found the logical answer
   9513 9.23%:  would like to be the first one to see you
   9514 9.22%:  should totally write a science book to get
   9515 9.22%:  think you just won the giant
   9516 80.47%:  think you just won the giant debate!!
   9517 9.22%:  just thought of a new book to
   9518 21.28%:  just thought of a new book to read
   9519 9.21%:  cannot breathe right now because of so
   9520 9.21%:  really thought it would be easier to counter
   9521 9.21%:  think we should all just forget you
   9522 9.21%:  really need to think about this sooner!!
   9523 9.21%:  think you just created the new science for our age
   9524 9.37%:  think you just created the new science for our age!!
   9525 9.20%:  think you just ruined the cool answer

   9537 9.19%:  could totally see that being true now!!
   9538 9.19%:  think you just found a great reason to be
   9539 9.19%:  guess that could be why
   9540 9.19%:  guess you could write that on the back of a coin

   9560 9.16%:  think we just found the real science to
   9561 16.44%:  think we just found the real science to our
   9562 9.15%:  just figured that out three

  10459 8.85%:  need to get to the science library to answer
  10460 8.80%:  could totally see that being our first
  10461 8.80%:  need to get back to you on this one because after
  10462 8.80%:  can totally see this being a better
  10463 8.80%:  totally just learned about the science of gi
  10464 8.80%:  thought we could
  10465 45.93%:  thought we could finally
  10466 9.62%:  thought we could settle
  10467 8.80%:  was just about to tell you another
  10468 8.79%:  need to write about this on the back of a bus!!
  10469 8.79%:  need to write a book about these figures
  10470 8.79%:  need to talk to you later about our new life
  10471 8.79%:  would like that theory to be true because if
  10472 8.79%:  thought you were all about science and not belief
  10473 8.79%:  need to talk to you about science after hours!!
  10474 8.79%:  just figured out the science to all the
  10475 8.78%:  really need to get on that book club
  10476 8.78%:  think you just blew all our chances for a better
  10477 8.78%:  think we just figured out nearly
  10478 8.78%:  need to write a book about this before he can get
  10479 8.78%:  think we just found this
  10480 158.93%:  think we just found this century
  10481 8.78%:  think we should totally be
  10482 9.55%:  think we should totally be science
  10483 8.84%:  think we should totally be best
  10484 8.78%:  just thought of a better answer!!
  10485 8.78%:  really need to get out of this house to
  10486 8.78%:  need to think about this greater
  10487 8.77%:  think you just wrote the best fr
  10488 8.77%:  really need to figure out this whole non
  10489 8.77%:  would like that to be the least of our
  10490 8.77%:  think you just won the science lecture!!
  10491 8.77%:  need to write that science book real
  10492 23.10%:  need to write that science book real fast
  10493 14.88%:  need to write that science book real fast!!
  10494 8.77%:  need to think about this answer before agree
  10495 8.77%:  really need to learn about the things before
  10496 8.76%:  could totally see that being one of the reason
  10497 8.76%:  think you just created a reason
  10498 52.10%:  think you just created a reason for
  10499 9.67%:  think you just created a reason to write
  10500 8.76%:  think you just ruined all of the
  10501 8.76%:  think we just found another secret to
  10502 8.76%:  think you just found the real answer to literal
  10503 8.76%:  need to get back to you on that before lunch
  10504 8.76%:  really need to start looking for science
  10505 8.76%:  really need to know about science better!!
  10506 8.75%:  think you just blew the entire last
  10507 8.75%:  could totally see that being the case !!
  10508 8.75%:  should totally write a book that goes
  10509 8.75%:  would like that to be true if only because no one gets
  10510 8.75%:  can totally see how this could be true for
  10511 10.67%:  can totally see how this could be true for certain
  10512 8.75%:  need to write that science story!!
  10513 8.75%:  think you just blew all the giant bro
  10514 8.75%:  could totally see that taking
  10515 8.75%:  just thought of a way to be cool
  10516 8.75%:  think we just figured out the real reason an
  10517 8.75%:  really need to figure out that
  10518 26.66%:  really need to figure out that whole
  10519 42.98%:  really need to figure out that whole science
  10520 8.75%:  was just about to thank you for being on the
  10521 8.75%:  just figured out another way to be
  10522 17.95%:  just figured out another way to be certain
  10523 8.74%:  think you just ruined the cos
  10524 8.74%:  would like to see your notes on that after
  10525 12.37%:  would like to see your notes on that after lunch
  10526 8.74%:  need to go think about this one because clearly
  10527 8.74%:  would like to be the first guy to eat
  10528 8.73%:  just thought of a reason to include
  10529 8.73%:  really need to get back into science later
  10530 8.73%:  think we just figured out the last r
  10531 8.73%:  really need to think about that science before
  10532 8.73%:  think we just learned about science too
  10533 55.56%:  think we just learned about science too late for
  10534 51.64%:  think we just learned about science too late!!
  10535 45.30%:  think we just learned about science too late for our
  10536 36.02%:  think we just learned about science too late for you
  10537 8.73%:  really like
  10538 112.20%:  really like that idea!!
  10539 49.41%:  really like that idea better
  10540 41.23%:  really like that idea better now
  10541 32.29%:  really like that idea better!!
  10542 27.87%:  really like that idea but
  10543 27.83%:  really like that one
  10544 24.94%:  really like that idea now

  10547 23.80%:  really like that one better
  10548 19.89%:  really like that one better than
  10549 18.08%:  really like that one better!!
  10550 17.82%:  really like this
  10551 16.47%:  really like that ending
  10552 57.62%:  really like that ending better
  10553 50.49%:  really like that ending better than
  10554 42.70%:  really like that ending better!!
  10555 21.10%:  really like that ending better too
  10556 21.07%:  really like that ending better because
  10557 19.52%:  really like that ending better too!!
  10558 17.52%:  really like that ending because
  10559 13.91%:  really like this one
  10560 14.83%:  really like this one better
  10561 19.70%:  really like this one better than
  10562 13.59%:  really like that ending better than before
  10563 12.69%:  really like this new
  10564 12.04%:  really like this one!!
  10565 11.97%:  really like that because
  10566 11.71%:  really like that ending where
  10567 11.58%:  really like this because
  10568 11.09%:  really like this one better!!
  10569 11.05%:  really like that idea but then
  10570 10.51%:  really like that idea now!!
  10571 9.58%:  really like that ending!!
  10572 8.72%:  thought it was all
  10573 8.72%:  need to get on this because clearly that
  10574 8.72%:  can totally see where this train
  10575 8.72%:  need to start working on a theory of the
  10576 8.72%:  guess you could write that on the back of a beer
  10577 8.72%:  think you should be careful not to strain
  10578 8.72%:  really need to get back to the lab before it
  10579 8.72%:  think you just found the new star
  10580 8.71%:  need to think about this because before
  10581 8.71%:  was just about to eat lunch!!
  10582 8.71%:  would like that to be the case because if only
  10583 8.71%:  could totally see that being our answer to
  10584 8.71%:  think we just learned about science the
  10585 8.71%:  was just about to tell the
  10586 8.71%:  think that would be a great story!!
  10587 8.71%:  guess you could write that one

  10938 8.49%:  would like to be the first guy to reach
  10939 8.49%:  think you just created a science for the
  10940 8.49%:  need to write a book about it because those
  10941 8.49%:  would like that to be the subject of an
  10942 8.49%:  should write a science blog
  10943 8.49%:  just figured out where all the non
  10944 8.49%:  thought it was black
  10945 8.49%:  think we should totally agree

  10947 8.48%:  think they just
  10948 8.48%:  think we just figured out a reason to care
  10949 8.48%:  thought you were a real science student
  10950 8.48%:  really need to figure out what counts
  10951 8.47%:  just figured out why science
  10952 8.47%:  need to write a book about this last one!!
  10953 8.47%:  would like that to be the least boring reason
  10954 8.47%:  think we just totally changed science for re
  10955 8.47%:  need to go think about what science
  10956 19.40%:  need to go think about what science really
  10957 8.47%:  think you should be careful not to lose

  11153 50.49%:  would like that to be the case not only for science
  11154 18.03%:  would like that to be the case not only for gi
  11155 14.35%:  would like that to be the case not only because being
  11156 8.66%:  would like that to be the case not because of being

  11170 8.37%:  just figured out the reason to
  11171 8.37%:  should write a science book about that but only

  11215 8.34%:  really need to think about this cause
  11216 8.34%:  just thought of a totally credible new science!!
  11217 8.34%:  would like to be the first guy to learn about a
  11218 8.34%:  just figured out where the entire
  11219 8.33%:  think you just won the debates
  11220 8.33%:  need to get to the front
  11221 8.33%:  need to get to the science section of a

  11256 8.33%:  should totally write a book about there
  11257 8.33%:  should write a book about it just
  11258 8.46%:  should write a book about it just to be
  11259 8.33%:  think that totally
  11260 26.51%:  think that totally sounds
  11261 11.31%:  think that totally could
  11262 10.50%:  think that totally answers
  11263 8.33%:  need to think about that one before you
  11264 8.32%:  think we found our science subject
  11265 8.32%:  really should know better than to go on first
  11266 8.32%:  would like that to be true if only because once
  11267 8.32%:  would like to be the first to learn

  11734 8.28%:  think we just found the one real
  11735 8.28%:  think you just blew science out of the barn
  11736 25.09%:  think you just blew science out of the barn door
  11737 11.60%:  think you just blew science out of the barn door!!
  11738 8.28%:  need to go think about that for re
  11739 22.66%:  need to go think about that for reals now
  11740 14.08%:  need to go think about that for reals now!!
  11741 8.27%:  need to get on this theory at
  11742 17.43%:  need to get on this theory at once because
  11743 8.27%:  think we just created a theory of science too
  11744 8.27%:  really need to work on being better at this job!!
  11745 8.27%:  would like to be the first to laugh at you!!
  11746 8.27%:  think you just created a new secret
  11747 8.27%:  could totally see that being one reason we
  11748 8.27%:  would be totally into
  11749 54.71%:  would be totally into that!!
  11750 43.36%:  would be totally into that because
  11751 43.10%:  would be totally into that being
  11752 20.79%:  would be totally into that because science
  11753 15.15%:  would be totally into that science
  11754 12.24%:  would be totally into this
  11755 15.58%:  would be totally into this because
  11756 27.24%:  would be totally into this because then
  11757 8.87%:  would be totally into that one
  11758 8.27%:  would like to hear you argue this case to
  11759 8.27%:  totally just learned about the science of being
  11760 8.26%:  think you just won the debate for real science
  11761 8.26%:  think we just found the story
  11762 8.26%:  would like to hear about that first
  11763 8.26%:  need to talk about this theory on science
  11764 8.26%:  think we just found the secret to real gi
  11765 8.26%:  need to talk to this guy about his fr
  11766 8.26%:  need to write that science book faster!!
  11767 8.26%:  really need to talk to this science teacher of
  11768 8.26%:  gotta write that book and
  11769 8.26%:  would like to see the science to
  11770 8.25%:  really need to get back to the science lab soon!!
  11771 8.25%:  always
  11772 427.56%:  always thought it
  11773 41.87%:  always thought it looked
  11774 33.54%:  always thought it stood

  11777 22.95%:  always figured
  11778 22.32%:  always thought it could be a
  11779 20.64%:  always thought it could be because
  11780 17.96%:  always figured that

  11790 9.06%:  always thought it could be like
  11791 9.02%:  always liked
  11792 8.25%:  can totally see this being correct now
  11793 8.25%:  think we found the secret to eternal joy!!
  11794 8.25%:  need to write this story for
  11795 8.25%:  think you just blew all our chances at free
  11796 8.25%:  think you just accused
  11797 8.25%:  think you just learned about the last
  11798 8.25%:  need to get back to you on this because if

  11800 8.25%:  think you just created one of the best narr
  11801 8.25%:  think we just figured out a real reason to colon
  11802 8.24%:  think you should go tell
  11803 10.72%:  think you should go tell science
  11804 36.76%:  think you should go tell science about
  11805 8.24%:  guess that would account for the tiny
  11806 8.24%:  would like to see this theory be
  11807 8.24%:  was totally gonna be the first to be
  11808 16.84%:  was totally gonna be the first to be like
  11809 8.24%:  think that could be our first real clue!!
  11810 8.24%:  thought you were an actual science bro too
  11811 8.24%:  really need to look into that before this
  11812 8.24%:  need to go write about this because there
  11813 8.24%:  was just talking to a friend!!
  11814 8.24%:  could totally see that being the case in one of our
  11815 8.24%:  think you just blew our entire reason to
  11816 8.24%:  really think this
  11817 8.23%:  need to get to the library before all the sc
  11818 8.23%:  think you just created a science where all of
  11819 8.23%:  need to write a letter
  11820 106.99%:  need to write a letter to science
  11821 16.43%:  need to write a letter to science!!
  11822 14.57%:  need to write a letter to science guys
  11823 8.23%:  was totally gonna be the first to look
  11824 8.23%:  need to go write a science fantasy book!!
  11825 8.23%:  think we just figured out the absence
  11826 8.23%:  need to write a book because that is the cool
  11827 8.23%:  really need to figure out the secret
  11828 8.23%:  think you just earned the title of cool
  11829 8.23%:  think you just ruined the great
  11830 8.23%:  think you just ruined all of ast
  11831 8.23%:  think we just learned about reality
  11832 8.22%:  just thought of a science article
  11833 8.22%:  can totally see how that got
  11834 8.22%:  think we just figured out the only reason to be!!
  11835 8.22%:  really need to write that on a stick
  11836 8.22%:  was totally gonna be the first one here

  13092 9.65%:  feel like you just ruined that whole secret
  13093 9.62%:  feel like we just had
  13094 9.57%:  feel like you just ruined that whole area
  13095 9.57%:  feel like that would be the best reason not
  13096 9.56%:  feel like you just changed the rules in a
  13097 9.55%:  feel like you just told
  13098 9.54%:  feel like we just changed the rules to
  13099 9.52%:  feel like that could be the best news
  13100 9.49%:  feel like there should be a warning about not
  13101 9.48%:  feel like that would be such a better use
  13102 9.47%:  feel like you just showed
  13103 9.46%:  feel like you just brought science down here
  13104 9.47%:  feel like you just brought science down here to
  13105 9.44%:  feel like this could be the new
  13106 9.44%:  feel like this could be another way
  13107 9.37%:  feel like science just changed
  13108 9.37%:  feel like this theory could be wrong but at
  13109 9.37%:  feel like you just turned the lights on at
  13110 9.36%:  feel like that could be a better
  13111 44.47%:  feel like that could be a better theory!!

  13117 9.35%:  feel like there should be a contest
  13118 9.32%:  feel like you just stole that out
  13119 9.30%:  feel like you just changed science on
  13120 9.30%:  feel like this could be the story
  13121 9.29%:  feel like the only thing between
  13122 9.28%:  feel like that would be a better subject
  13123 9.27%:  feel like that theory could be correct!!
  13124 9.27%:  feel like this has
  13125 28.13%:  feel like this has been
  13126 10.09%:  feel like this has already
  13127 9.27%:  feel like that theory just got ruined because now
  13128 9.27%:  feel like you just turned the entire solar
  13129 9.25%:  feel like that should be written on a t
  13130 9.25%:  feel like the answer to that could be yes or
  13131 9.24%:  feel like you just changed the entire laws
  13132 9.24%:  feel like the only reason we don
  13133 9.23%:  feel like you just went
  13134 13.00%:  feel like you just went through
  13135 9.23%:  feel like this theory just got turned

  13137 9.20%:  feel like you just watched the entire last
  13138 9.19%:  feel like that could be the secret
  13139 9.17%:  feel like that would be easier to say out
  13140 9.16%:  feel like that could be the best reason to go
  13141 9.12%:  feel like science just got a
  13142 12.16%:  feel like science just got a whole
  13143 59.72%:  feel like science just got a whole bunch
  13144 9.09%:  feel like this could be the answer to a century
  13145 9.09%:  feel like that could be worth
  13146 9.09%:  feel like we just learned about our
  13147 9.03%:  feel like we should be saying that about our
  13148 9.02%:  feel like that could be an entire new
  13149 9.02%:  feel like the answer to that could be yes or no but
  13150 9.00%:  feel like we should be saying that about once
  13151 8.99%:  feel like you just created the coolest thing on
  13152 8.98%:  feel like you just threw the
  13153 25.77%:  feel like you just threw the entire
  13154 8.98%:  feel like that could be the best way to be
  13155 8.96%:  feel like this could be your best chance to get on
  13156 8.93%:  feel like you just created a science that
  13157 8.93%:  feel like science just got blown
  13158 8.92%:  feel like this would be the correct
  13159 8.90%:  feel like that should be way easier to be
  13160 8.88%:  feel like you just threw out an
  13161 17.34%:  feel like you just threw out an entire
  13162 11.72%:  feel like you just threw out an idea so
  13163 10.51%:  feel like you just threw out an insane
  13164 8.86%:  feel like you just blew science
  13165 12.52%:  feel like you just blew science out
  13166 8.86%:  feel like that could be the best answer to an
  13167 8.85%:  feel like we just got

  13173 8.84%:  feel like that should be your new science
  13174 8.84%:  feel like that could be right but
  13175 8.82%:  feel like we just learned about that in the
  13176 8.82%:  feel like you just created the answer
  13177 8.82%:  feel like you just changed the balance
  13178 8.81%:  feel like you just went through a
  13179 8.80%:  feel like that should be its own cart
  13180 33.12%:  feel like that should be its own cartoon or
  13181 23.84%:  feel like that should be its own cartoon!!

  13186 8.76%:  feel like that would be such a great science
  13187 8.76%:  feel like that could be the correct answer but no
  13188 8.76%:  feel like that should count against your bet
  13189 8.74%:  feel like there should be a way to ruin
  13190 8.73%:  feel like this could be an answer to that
  13191 8.73%:  feel like the answer should be no but you
  13192 8.71%:  feel like that would change science a
  13193 8.68%:  feel like you just changed the answer to a
  13194 8.67%:  feel like this theory could be wrong about
  13195 8.67%:  feel like that should be one
  13196 8.67%:  feel like you just brought the
  13197 20.78%:  feel like you just brought the entire
  13198 8.65%:  feel like we just thought
  13199 8.62%:  feel like that would be the best reason to go on
  13200 8.60%:  feel like you just ruined the answer to that long
  13201 8.60%:  feel like this theory just got turned on
  13202 8.59%:  feel like you just used
  13203 8.59%:  feel like you just got closer to the idea
  13204 8.58%:  feel like you just crushed the
  13205 30.40%:  feel like you just crushed the entire
  13206 8.57%:  feel like that would be such a great story but
  13207 8.57%:  feel like that could be the best worst
  13208 8.57%:  feel like you just turned on
  13209 8.56%:  feel like you just said the one
  13210 8.55%:  feel like that should be in

  13213 8.50%:  feel like there should be a button
  13214 8.49%:  feel like you just changed the real
  13215 8.48%:  feel like science just blew

  13217 20.11%:  feel like you just shot down that entire
  13218 8.56%:  feel like you just shot down that entire career
  13219 8.45%:  feel like science just got turned
  13220 8.44%:  feel like that could be an answer to the
  13221 8.43%:  feel like we should get that
  13222 8.42%:  feel like that could be the best answer about
  13223 8.42%:  feel like that could be science
  13224 8.41%:  feel like you just ruined that answer
  13225 8.41%:  feel like science just got better and cool
  13226 8.40%:  feel like there should be a big
  13227 8.40%:  feel like that should be written on a stone
  13228 8.40%:  feel like that could be the correct answer so it
  13229 8.39%:  feel like you should be using
  13230 21.47%:  feel like you should be using that
  13231 14.80%:  feel like you should be using the

  13235 8.35%:  feel like you just shot down the entire nature
  13236 8.33%:  feel like you should write a
  13237 11.51%:  feel like you should write a screen
  13238 8.33%:  feel like you just turned the lights on on
  13239 8.31%:  feel like you just turned that whole
  13240 19.88%:  feel like you just turned that whole science
  13241 8.31%:  feel like you just ruined both the
  13242 8.28%:  feel like you just brought science down to earth!!
  13243 8.28%:  feel like this theory could go
  13244 8.28%:  feel like you just brought the science
  13245 9.35%:  feel like you just brought the science down
  13246 8.27%:  feel like this could be the start to a new
  13247 8.25%:  feel like you just threw out a great
  13248 16.55%:  feel like you just threw out a great science
  13249 14.41%:  feel like you just threw out a great idea!!
  13250 8.25%:  feel like the answer is already
  13251 8.25%:  feel like that could be the correct answer a tiny
  13252 8.24%:  feel like you just threw out the entire canon
  13253 8.22%:  feel like that answers
  13254 8.19%:  feel like that idea was
  13255 41.43%:  feel like that idea was stolen
  13256 8.18%:  feel like there should be a story
  13257 14.26%:  feel like there should be a story about
  13258 8.17%:  feel like the answer to that is gonna
  13259 8.16%:  feel like that should be easier to argue
  13260 8.15%:  feel like that idea just stole
  13261 8.15%:  feel like that should count as your
  13262 8.15%:  feel like that could be the correct answer out
  13263 8.14%:  feel like you just threw out an idea there
  13264 8.13%:  think you are correct about the
  13265 8.13%:  think you just got the idea for a new career
  13266 8.13%:  think you just blew that idea
  13267 8.13%:  should write a book about these giant fly
  13268 8.13%:  would like this to be correct because holy
  13269 8.13%:  need to talk to the science writers of
  13270 8.13%:  need to write a book that says nothing
  13271 8.12%:  think we just found out the reason all
  13272 8.12%:  guess they could be real if we
  13273 8.12%:  think we just figured out the case
  13274 8.12%:  guess that could be a theory!!
  13275 8.12%:  feel like that could be a serious
  13276 14.84%:  feel like that could be a serious theory
  13277 13.61%:  feel like that could be a serious threat
  13278 37.93%:  feel like that could be a serious threat to our
  13279 8.12%:  really need to figure out how to take notes in
  13280 8.12%:  think you just screw
  13281 8.12%:  need to talk to you alone for a while!!
  13282 8.12%:  forgot to include this theory!!
  13283 8.12%:  would like that to be true but only
  13284 8.12%:  need to think about this because you are correct on

  13287 8.12%:  would like that to be the case for giant
  13288 8.12%:  really need to learn about the science for
  13289 33.46%:  really need to learn about the science for this
  13290 12.66%:  really need to learn about the science for this to
  13291 8.12%:  would like that to be the case one
  13292 8.12%:  think you just blew our entire secret agenda

  13308 8.11%:  really need to think about these counter
  13309 8.11%:  need to get to the science faster
  13310 8.11%:  guess you could call that fake too
  13311 8.11%:  thought you were not
  13312 8.10%:  should totally write a science teacher book!!
  13313 8.10%:  just figured out the reason there
  13314 8.10%:  think we just found a real science teacher
  13315 8.10%:  think we just found the last logical
  13316 8.10%:  need to write a story about nothing else
  13317 8.10%:  think we just created another reason to go
  13318 8.10%:  would like that to be true if only because ghost
  13319 8.10%:  think we should all just agree to be

  13324 8.09%:  think you just wrote a better sc
  13325 8.09%:  think you just found a science career that
  13326 8.09%:  need to think really

  13328 8.09%:  would like to be the first to change
  13329 8.09%:  think this could be one
  13330 8.09%:  should totally write a short
  13331 8.09%:  really need to figure out where to
  13332 8.08%:  would like to see your source for that thing
  13333 8.08%:  need to think about this because all of
  13334 8.08%:  really need to get on the
  13335 65.64%:  really need to get on the science
  13336 17.83%:  really need to get on the science boat
  13337 15.25%:  really need to get on the whole
  13338 8.08%:  could totally see that being one of those rare
  13339 8.08%:  think this just turned
  13340 8.08%:  need to think about this longer but also

  13355 8.07%:  need to get back to you on that before lunch because
  13356 8.07%:  think we just found the real science guy
  13357 8.07%:  guess that would account for the black
  13358 8.06%:  forgot to include that one because you
  13359 20.78%:  forgot to include that one because you weren

  13404 8.03%:  can totally see that being the end
  13405 38.11%:  can totally see that being the end of our
  13406 8.03%:  can totally get behind that science for
  13407 26.47%:  can totally get behind that science for sure

  13560 7.95%:  just figured out the real reason they want
  13561 7.95%:  just thought of a radical
  13562 64.85%:  just thought of a radical new science
  13563 7.95%:  need to think about this for a real sec!!

  14016 7.68%:  should write a science book really
  14017 7.67%:  would like to see that being
  14018 7.67%:  think we just learned about science before you
  14019 7.67%:  need to think about this one for just
  14020 7.67%:  could totally see that working in the case
  14021 7.67%:  like your ideas better than all others

  14044 7.66%:  would like to be the first one to be eaten by a solar
  14045 7.66%:  feel like you just ruined the answer to a lot
  14046 7.66%:  need to go think about this now because all of
  14047 7.65%:  totally just figured out where the real

  14227 7.62%:  need to go write this book
  14228 7.62%:  just thought of a new science book title and
  14229 7.61%:  think you just won this battle of
  14230 7.61%:  would like to see a theory about that before
  14231 7.61%:  really need to figure out what color that is!!

  14639 8.66%:  feel like you just got the last word in on our
  14640 8.00%:  feel like you just got the last word here
  14641 7.45%:  just figured that out as
  14642 18.15%:  just figured that out as well
  14643 7.45%:  should write that in a book about
  14644 7.45%:  think we found the real secret reason
  14645 7.45%:  think we found the secret to our reality!!
  14646 7.45%:  can totally see how that connect
  14647 7.45%:  would like to be the first one to correct such
  14648 7.45%:  really need to catch
  14649 7.45%:  need to tell the science guys that
  14650 10.23%:  need to tell the science guys that one
  14651 7.57%:  need to tell the science guys that one!!
  14652 7.45%:  would like to be the one to say first
  14653 7.45%:  like your science better than real
  14654 7.45%:  think you found the answer to our age
  14655 7.45%:  should totally write a book right
  14656 7.45%:  really need to think about this later so
  14657 7.45%:  need to write about that in a
  14658 10.81%:  need to write about that in a book!!
  14659 7.45%:  need to get back to you about this when

  14661 7.45%:  need to start writing all
  14662 8.63%:  need to start writing all these
  14663 7.44%:  think we just figured out to
  14664 7.44%:  would like to see your facts
  14665 7.44%:  would like to be the first to gently
  14666 7.44%:  think that would count as real
  14667 12.34%:  think that would count as real science
  14668 7.44%:  should write a book for
  14669 7.44%:  need to talk to you about this because no
  14670 7.44%:  think you should call science to
  14671 7.44%:  feel like you just got the last word there!!
  14672 7.44%:  guess that could be one theory!!
  14673 7.43%:  would like that to be true because nothing else can
  14674 7.43%:  think we should totally figure out a
  14675 7.43%:  just figured out how to tell science
  14676 7.43%:  think we found the correct
  14677 7.43%:  think you found the secret to true science!!
  14678 7.43%:  could totally see that working because there
  14679 7.43%:  would like to be there for that one science
  14680 7.43%:  think we found out about
  14681 21.04%:  think we found out about science
  14682 20.97%:  think we found out about the
  14683 31.09%:  think we found out about the secret

  14686 60.87%:  think we found out about the real reason
  14687 14.91%:  think we found out about the real secret
  14688 7.43%:  think you just created the science of our era!!
  14689 7.43%:  would like to be the first one to correct such an
  14690 7.43%:  feel like this could be your best chance to get out
  14691 7.43%:  really need to think about this for longer but
  14692 7.43%:  need to think about this later cause
  14693 7.43%:  feel like you just turned the whole giant
  14694 7.43%:  need to get back to the science library to
  14695 11.14%:  need to get back to the science library to learn
  14696 7.43%:  forgot to include that theory because none
  14697 7.42%:  really need to get back to science writers
  14698 7.42%:  could totally see that being a secret
  14699 7.42%:  need to write a story about this before he can
  14700 7.42%:  feel like you just changed this
  14701 7.42%:  need to think about this for longer because all
  14702 7.42%:  think you just started a new career
  14703 7.42%:  can totally see that being one of those wild
  14704 7.42%:  think you just said enough
  14705 13.15%:  think you just said enough to warrant
  14706 8.93%:  think you just said enough for
  14707 7.42%:  think that could really be science
  14708 7.42%:  need to go write a story about those fake
  14709 7.42%:  would like to see the source of that article you
  14710 7.42%:  just thought of one billion ways
  14711 7.47%:  just thought of one billion ways dark
  14712 7.42%:  need to talk to you about our entire
  14713 7.42%:  think we just figured out the coolest re
  14714 7.42%:  forgot to include that in all
  14715 35.77%:  forgot to include that in all the reasons
  14716 8.38%:  forgot to include that in all the ways
  14717 7.42%:  need to write a book about that one science
  14718 7.42%:  would like this theory to be true for
  14719 7.42%:  would like to see their
  14720 7.42%:  think we just found our theory!!
  14721 7.42%:  will
  14722 7.42%:  think we should be careful not to say certain
  14723 7.42%:  really need to check into that before
  14724 7.42%:  should totally write a book about big
  14725 7.42%:  think you just learned about science too
  14726 140.96%:  think you just learned about science too late for
  14727 30.99%:  think you just learned about science too late!!
  14728 7.41%:  really need to work on these things better
  14729 7.41%:  think you changed
  14730 7.41%:  like this new theory best of all our
  14731 7.41%:  thought you were on science
  14732 7.41%:  would say that is an
  14733 7.41%:  like this theory better all
  14734 7.41%:  think you just found a whole
  14735 7.41%:  think you just got the coolest idea on
  14736 7.41%:  think you just ruined all the cool facts
  14737 7.41%:  think you just blew science a bunch
  14738 7.41%:  need to think about the science
  14739 7.41%:  think you just hit on an actual good
  14740 7.41%:  need to go write a book about the
  14741 47.74%:  need to go write a book about the science
  14742 13.95%:  need to go write a book about the secrets
  14743 7.40%:  think you just threw out a radical
  14744 7.40%:  need to write a book about these intense
  14745 7.40%:  really need to get on that science job
  14746 7.40%:  think you just blew our entire agenda
  14747 23.42%:  think you just blew our entire agenda for the last
  14748 7.40%:  guess that would be a little
  14749 7.40%:  thought you were all about science earlier
  14750 7.40%:  really need to check that out sooner
  14751 7.40%:  can totally see that working out so
  14752 7.40%:  cannot breathe right now because too
  14753 7.40%:  think we just figured out the real reason to label
  14754 7.39%:  would like that to be the case for about
  14755 7.39%:  like where your head is because
  14756 7.39%:  need to go sit
  14757 7.39%:  would like that to be the case if only just
  14758 7.39%:  feel like we should just
  14759 7.39%:  would like to see your source on that being the real
  14760 7.39%:  just had a
  14761 14.15%:  just had a great
  14762 9.03%:  just had a totally
  14763 9.28%:  just had a totally sweet
  14764 7.39%:  think you need to tell the rest of science
  14765 7.39%:  need to talk to the other guys
  14766 7.39%:  think you figured out what all
  14767 7.39%:  think you just altered the current science
  14768 7.39%:  would like to see the science on that for real
  14769 7.39%:  think you just got a
  14770 10.28%:  think you just got a science
  14771 10.18%:  think you just got a little
  14772 52.21%:  think you just got a little closer
  14773 7.44%:  think you just got a science award
  14774 7.39%:  need to talk to the science guy!!
  14775 7.39%:  need to talk to you about the science before sharing
  14776 7.39%:  thought you were kinda into
  14777 7.38%:  know nothing about the subject you
  14778 7.38%:  think this could totally be a
  14779 7.88%:  think this could totally be a new
  14780 7.38%:  can totally see where that goes
  14781 7.38%:  really need to think about that before science
  14782 7.38%:  really need to start eating fewer
  14783 11.40%:  really need to start eating fewer books
  14784 8.31%:  really need to start eating fewer cookies
  14785 7.38%:  totally just learned about science for no
  14786 7.38%:  thought you were all about facts
  14787 7.38%:  need to write a book about all the things no
  14788 7.38%:  need to think about this because we can
  14789 7.38%:  really need to figure out how to talk in
  14790 7.38%:  think we just learned about the one secret
  14791 7.38%:  really need to get back into science to
  14792 7.37%:  think we just learned about science bro
  14793 7.37%:  think we just learned that
  14794 93.78%:  think we just learned that science
  14795 9.43%:  think we just learned that science really
  14796 7.37%:  need to get back to you on this because what
  14797 7.54%:  need to get back to you on this because what if
  14798 7.37%:  can totally see that working into
  14799 7.37%:  think you just created a new science to be
  14800 7.37%:  forgot about that one because it is beyond
  14801 7.37%:  need to think about this one closely for
  14802 7.37%:  like this better than your last one
  14803 7.37%:  need to talk to you about science alone
  14804 10.26%:  need to talk to you about science alone right
  14805 7.37%:  think we just found real
  14806 62.37%:  think we just found real science
  14807 41.64%:  think we just found real science!!
  14808 29.97%:  think we just found real science here
  14809 21.28%:  think we just found real science here!!
  14810 13.19%:  think we just found real science that
  14811 7.37%:  really need to figure out how to use that joke
  14812 22.47%:  really need to figure out how to use that joke in real
  14813 7.37%:  really need to figure out a new
  14814 7.37%:  need to talk to the science guys about all of
  14815 7.37%:  totally should write a science book after
  14816 7.37%:  need to go think about this alone because we
  14817 7.37%:  feel like you should be the one using
  14818 7.37%:  think you just went full science!!
  14819 7.37%:  think you just figured the secret to all
  14820 7.37%:  really need to start talking this
  14821 7.37%:  would like to hear about that one first
  14822 7.36%:  was totally gonna end
  14823 16.62%:  was totally gonna end this there
  14824 12.52%:  was totally gonna end this there but
  14825 9.83%:  was totally gonna end the
  14826 9.76%:  was totally gonna end there
  14827 9.49%:  was totally gonna end this there!!
  14828 7.36%:  thought you were about to ask a
  14829 7.36%:  think you better tell the world before
  14830 7.36%:  can totally see that working out for sure!!
  14831 7.36%:  need to talk to you about life choices later when
  14832 7.36%:  think we just figured out the reason to all
  14833 7.36%:  feel like that could be the easiest
  14834 7.36%:  just thought of a new science book to read later
  14835 7.48%:  just thought of a new science book to read later!!
  14836 7.36%:  really need to figure out how to react in such
  14837 7.36%:  need to think about that one so
  14838 7.36%:  need to talk to you about telling
  14839 7.36%:  really need to figure out how to use science to track
  14840 7.36%:  like this theory best of all and want
  14841 7.36%:  really need to figure out how to check sources
  14842 7.36%:  need to go think about this all alone
  14843 20.31%:  need to go think about this all alone for
  14844 7.36%:  feel like we just changed the rules to our
  14845 7.35%:  really need to think about that sooner!!
  14846 7.35%:  guess that could be the only
  14847 7.35%:  think that would be correct!!
  14848 7.35%:  forgot to include that because the only
  14849 52.50%:  forgot to include that because the only reason
  14850 28.45%:  forgot to include that because the only reason we
  14851 7.35%:  need to write a book about all of this but
  14852 7.35%:  really think that would be too
  14853 7.35%:  think you just changed all our beliefs between
  14854 7.35%:  can totally see how this could get
  14855 10.14%:  can totally see how this could get out
  14856 7.35%:  totally think that could be a
  14857 7.35%:  think we just figured out the real reason 
  14858 7.34%:  feel like you should be the one being start
  14859 7.34%:  feel like we just learned about this theory about
  14860 7.34%:  think you just hit on a great reason for
  14861 7.34%:  need to go think about that for sure
  14862 7.34%:  need to talk to you alone because these
  14863 7.34%:  really need to talk to science about whether
  14864 7.34%:  would like that to be true if only because then an
  14865 7.34%:  think you just ruined the one great secret
  14866 7.34%:  need to go write a story about it
  14867 7.34%:  think we just totally found the source
  14868 7.34%:  really need to get back into the
  14869 154.84%:  really need to get back into the science
  14870 84.80%:  really need to get back into the whole
  14871 14.21%:  really need to get back into the science of
  14872 9.24%:  really need to get back into the habit
  14873 7.34%:  was totally just about to conced
  14874 7.34%:  was just about to go back
  14875 28.28%:  was just about to go back to bed!!
  14876 14.48%:  was just about to go back to the
  14877 9.29%:  was just about to go back in
  14878 7.34%:  think you just blew our chances at eternal life or
  14879 7.34%:  just noticed
  14880 13.17%:  just noticed that
  14881 7.34%:  really need to start writing the
  14882 7.34%:  totally forgot about science because
  14883 7.33%:  need to write a book about the science of regular
  14884 7.33%:  need to talk to this guy about science for
  14885 7.33%:  should write a book on science
  14886 7.33%:  thought you were a science friend too
  14887 7.33%:  really need to figure out how to breathe in case
  14888 7.33%:  should totally write a book on the subject in
  14889 7.33%:  would like that to be correct real fast
  14890 7.33%:  feel like there should be a way to contact
  14891 7.33%:  need to talk to you about this for science!!
  14892 7.33%:  like your friends better than the actual
  14893 9.34%:  like your friends better than the actual ones
  14894 7.33%:  really need to check into that sooner or
  14895 7.33%:  totally just figured out another one
  14896 7.33%:  would like to be the first to laugh about
  14897 7.33%:  would like that theory better
  14898 7.33%:  need to write a story about these alien
  14899 7.33%:  really need to talk to science about whether or
  14900 7.33%:  really need to figure out the answer to the
  14901 7.32%:  feel like you just turned on the science
  14902 7.32%:  really need to think of better reasons gi
  14903 7.32%:  need to go write a book about all
  14904 53.18%:  need to go write a book about all these
  14905 24.18%:  need to go write a book about all the
  14906 19.64%:  need to go write a book about all the science
  14907 14.08%:  need to go write a book about all these secret
  14908 13.61%:  need to go write a book about all this!!
  14909 7.32%:  need to write a book about all these things on
  14910 7.32%:  just figured out where the rest
  14911 7.32%:  feel like that one
  14912 12.04%:  feel like that one should
  14913 25.98%:  feel like that one should be written
  14914 7.32%:  totally forgot about black
  14915 7.32%:  totally just learned science tonight
  14916 7.32%:  guess that could be one way to account for the 
  14917 7.32%:  really thought it would be easier for us to be
  14918 7.32%:  was just trying to find
  14919 13.74%:  was just trying to find out about
  14920 7.31%:  totally forgot about the non
  14921 7.31%:  would like to see that on the science table of your
  14922 7.31%:  think you just got the last word in on a
  14923 7.31%:  feel like you just brought down the entire balance
  14924 7.31%:  really thought it would be easier to take
  14925 7.31%:  was totally looking for the
  14926 8.47%:  was totally looking for the chance
  14927 7.31%:  think that sounds way better for
  14928 7.31%:  would like to hear nothing else about your fr
  14929 7.31%:  like your ideas better now than the last four
  14930 7.31%:  could totally see that being the reason in
  14931 7.31%:  need to talk to you about things for a sec
  14932 7.31%:  feel like science just turned
  14933 7.31%:  think you just created the best new belief
  14934 7.31%:  need to write a book about this before he gets any
  14935 7.31%:  really need to get out of this line
  14936 7.30%:  need to think about this because before you
  14937 7.30%:  guess you could call the
  14938 7.30%:  need to get back to the lab before the
  14939 10.79%:  need to get back to the lab before the sun
  14940 7.30%:  need to write about that because if
  14941 7.30%:  think you should run
  14942 7.30%:  think we just found the reason to create a
  14943 7.30%:  really like that ending because then we
  14944 7.30%:  need to write a book about these future
  14945 7.30%:  need to write a story about this for a
  14946 7.30%:  just thought of a new science and it
  14947 7.30%:  need to go think about that for years
  14948 9.94%:  need to go think about that for years now
  14949 7.30%:  think we just learned about the only
  14950 7.30%:  think we just figured out another 
  14951 7.30%:  need to write a book on this subject to
  14952 7.29%:  need to think about this last one before
  14953 7.29%:  really need to get on that book series about
  14954 7.29%:  think we just figured out the one reason to be a
  14955 7.29%:  think you just ruined one of the greater
  14956 7.29%:  think you just said a real
  14957 7.29%:  would like to be the first to burst
  14958 7.29%:  think you just found the last article
  14959 7.29%:  think you should get a science job!!
  14960 7.29%:  think you just found a hole
  14961 7.29%:  just figured out that there are
  14962 7.29%:  need to think about that for ages
  14963 7.29%:  would like to be the first to correct any
  14964 7.29%:  think you just blew giant holes
  14965 7.29%:  think you found the real answers
  14966 7.28%:  would like that to be true because it enables
  14967 7.28%:  feel like that theory was just born
  14968 7.28%:  should totally write a book for that science
  14969 7.28%:  need to go think about where
  14970 7.28%:  was just about to correct you on being
  14971 7.28%:  should totally write a book about these fine
  14972 7.28%:  feel like that should be easier to get
  14973 7.28%:  need to go write science books!!
  14974 7.28%:  would like to be the first one to say none
  14975 7.28%:  think we just found the secret to calling our
  14976 7.28%:  think we found the secret to telling
  14977 7.28%:  just figured out the answer that
  14978 7.28%:  feel like we just learned about another
  14979 7.28%:  forgot to include that one earlier because those
  14980 7.28%:  need to write a story about a secret

  14988 7.71%:  should write a book about that if only
  14989 7.27%:  feel like that theory could use a bit
  14990 7.27%:  need to get to the library before this los
  14991 7.27%:  feel like that should count as being correct but
  14992 7.27%:  know!!

  15104 7.25%:  would like to hear this story!!
  15105 7.25%:  think you just won the science debate bro
  15106 7.24%:  should totally write a book about science f
  15107 7.24%:  think you just wrote a better idea
  15108 8.47%:  think you just wrote a better idea for a sc

  15294 12.17%:  think we found the secret to real science
  15295 10.91%:  think we found the secret to real science!!
  15296 7.15%:  feel like you just changed science to
  15297 7.15%:  need to write a book about this before they can sue
  15298 7.15%:  really like that idea too
  15299 7.15%:  would like that to be the case because if not you
  15300 7.15%:  just figured out what that
  15301 7.15%:  thought you were all about science babies
  15302 7.15%:  really need to finish that book on ast
  15303 7.15%:  need to think about that for really
  15304 7.15%:  think we just figured out the sec

  15307 7.15%:  thought you were serious and
  15308 7.15%:  think you just earned a giant
  15309 7.15%:  totally just learned about science but
  15310 7.15%:  should write a book on that!!
  15311 7.15%:  think you figured out the real reason all
  15312 7.14%:  really need to look into that because just now
  15313 7.14%:  really need to start wearing clothes if

  15662 31.08%:  really think we just figured out the one secret
  15663 11.51%:  really think we just found the secret to being cooler
  15664 11.35%:  really think we just found out that
  15665 11.22%:  really think we just figured out the best
  15666 11.01%:  really think we just figured out the one reason
  15667 10.53%:  really think we just found the single
  15668 10.51%:  really think we just found the cool

  15687 7.05%:  think that could be your new
  15688 7.05%:  forgot about that one because they don
  15689 7.05%:  can totally get on board for this science
  15690 7.05%:  cannot think of a better way to build
  15691 7.05%:  really need to talk to the science section

  15695 7.04%:  guess you could write that in a book real
  15696 7.04%:  think that would justify
  15697 7.04%:  just thought of a science career
  15698 7.04%:  just figured out all the
  15699 53.60%:  just figured out all the science
  15700 34.14%:  just figured out all the science!!
  15701 7.33%:  just figured out all the science that
  15702 7.04%:  feel like we should be hearing
  15703 7.04%:  think you figured out a better reason we
  15704 7.04%:  really need to think about those before
  15705 7.04%:  totally just figured out whether
  15706 7.03%:  thought you were all about science and not beliefs
  15707 7.03%:  think you just ruined the secret of eternal
  15708 7.03%:  should write about that science
  15709 7.03%:  think you should be a giant
  15710 10.28%:  think you should be a giant because
  15711 7.03%:  think you just blew all the current
  15712 19.72%:  think you just blew all the current science

  15716 7.87%:  think you just won the science bro battle
  15717 7.03%:  would like to be the one to say this before
  15718 7.03%:  would like that to be the case because you get
  15719 7.03%:  need to talk to the other gi
  15720 7.03%:  feel like you just accused the
  15721 7.03%:  think you just ruined one of the last two real
  15722 7.03%:  think you just ruined a lot of what
  15723 7.03%:  really need to get on that science cruise
  15724 7.03%:  think you just found a great new
  15725 11.97%:  think you just found a great new career
  15726 7.03%:  thought you were all fake too but
  15727 7.03%:  was totally not
  15728 7.03%:  need to write a book about these flies
  15729 7.03%:  totally forgot about the science behind our
  15730 7.02%:  need to think about this because you are now correct
  15731 7.02%:  need to write about these things for
  15732 9.82%:  need to write about these things for real
  15733 7.02%:  think you just touched on science
  15734 7.02%:  can totally see it now
  15735 7.02%:  would like to be the first one to enter a
  15736 7.02%:  feel like you just ruined the real
  15737 39.67%:  feel like you just ruined the real reason
  15738 15.17%:  feel like you just ruined the real answer
  15739 124.37%:  feel like you just ruined the real answer to that
  15740 7.02%:  would like that to be true because then one
  15741 7.02%:  really need to figure out who
  15742 8.16%:  really need to figure out who these
  15743 7.02%:  would like to hear no

  15748 7.02%:  think you just changed all our beliefs to better
  15749 7.02%:  would like to see your source on that later
  15750 7.02%:  need to write a book about science fact
  15751 7.01%:  need to know about
  15752 81.18%:  need to know about this right
  15753 30.83%:  need to know about this theory
  15754 21.13%:  need to know about this!!

  15756 14.05%:  need to know about this theory before
  15757 11.11%:  need to know about this theory because
  15758 10.92%:  need to know about this sooner
  15759 133.76%:  need to know about this sooner rather
  15760 8.41%:  need to know about this because
  15761 7.03%:  need to know about this science
  15762 7.01%:  should write a story about that bro!!
  15763 7.01%:  really need to figure out what those jokes
  15764 7.01%:  really need to know about this before it changes our
  15765 7.01%:  need to think about this because we all
  15766 7.01%:  would like that to be the case for sure but
  15767 7.01%:  would like to be the first one to see you eat
  15768 7.01%:  feel like you just got closer to a
  15769 7.01%:  really need to think about this one for at
  15770 7.01%:  need to know about this before the
  15771 22.13%:  need to know about this before the science
  15772 7.01%:  was just about to take credit for un
  15773 7.01%:  forgot to include that because there was like
  15774 7.01%:  would like to see that on stage
  15775 7.01%:  need to think about it because holy
  15776 7.00%:  feel like that should get its
  15777 12.56%:  feel like that should get its own cart
  15778 12.39%:  feel like that should get its own cartoon or
  15779 11.47%:  feel like that should get its own cartoon!!
  15780 7.00%:  feel like that would count
  15781 112.58%:  feel like that would count as science
  15782 39.61%:  feel like that would count as science rather
  15783 26.59%:  feel like that would count against
  15784 25.82%:  feel like that would count as being
  15785 25.79%:  feel like that would count against your
  15786 15.57%:  feel like that would count as a
  15787 15.34%:  feel like that would count as science!!
  15788 12.58%:  feel like that would count against the
  15789 9.00%:  feel like that would count as science then
  15790 8.48%:  feel like that would count as a theory
  15791 7.37%:  feel like that would count as the
  15792 12.30%:  feel like that would count as the best
  15793 7.00%:  would like to see your source on that being a better
  15794 7.00%:  thought you were just te
  15795 7.00%:  guess you could write that on a ch
  15796 7.00%:  guess that could be true if
  15797 7.00%:  feel like you just turned this whole con
  15798 7.00%:  can totally see that being like
  15799 13.63%:  can totally see that being like the
  15800 9.59%:  can totally see that being like the second
  15801 7.00%:  really need to get back to the lab before this occurs

  15803 7.00%:  need to get back into science faster
  15804 7.00%:  think you just created real science here
  15805 7.00%:  need to think about this before reject
  15806 7.00%:  forgot to include that because clearly there
  15807 7.00%:  cannot think of a better way to close such
  15808 7.00%:  need to think about this fr
  15809 7.00%:  really need to figure out how to block these
  15810 7.00%:  can totally see that working out for our
  15811 20.30%:  can totally see that working out for our science
  15812 7.36%:  can totally see that working out for our science!!
  15813 7.00%:  feel like we should be using that to
  15814 7.00%:  think you are correct and that
  15815 7.00%:  really need to figure out what that joke is so
  15816 7.00%:  feel like you just changed the reason
  15817 7.00%:  really should know about this one before
  15818 7.00%:  need to get to the library like now
  15819 6.99%:  need to write a book about these guys then
  15820 6.99%:  really need to get on this science track

  15822 6.99%:  just thought of a reason to build an
  15823 22.19%:  just thought of a reason to build an orbit
  15824 6.99%:  need to write a book about it before the
  15825 6.99%:  think that answers
  15826 9.55%:  think that answers your
  15827 7.75%:  think that answers our

  15997 10.25%:  need to get back to this theory before
  15998 10.06%:  need to get back to this theory because
  15999 8.70%:  need to get back to this later
  16000 80.53%:  need to get back to this later because
  16001 44.50%:  need to get back to this later because holy
  16002 9.26%:  need to get back to this later because holy cow
  16003 6.96%:  need to think about this before you go
  16004 6.96%:  need to go write a book about these science fact
  16005 6.95%:  think we need to start a science blog
  16006 16.72%:  think we need to start a science blog about
  16007 6.95%:  would like to be the first guy to hear about an
  16008 6.95%:  really need to start fact
  16009 6.95%:  feel like that would be such a great story!!
  16010 6.95%:  just thought of a way to be cooler
  16011 6.95%:  need to talk to you about this science!!
  16012 6.95%:  like your ideas better than the ones we all
  16013 6.95%:  think we just found a real science theory!!
  16014 6.95%:  was just about to argue they
  16015 6.95%:  think we just figured out a really cool reason not
  16016 6.95%:  feel like you just got science
  16017 6.95%:  really need to think about this one fr
  16018 6.95%:  really need to figure out how to not take
  16019 8.55%:  really need to figure out how to not take science
  16020 6.94%:  could totally see that working out in our
  16021 6.94%:  would like to see a theory about this
  16022 6.94%:  was just about to get lunch
  16023 7.81%:  was just about to get lunch and
  16024 9.17%:  was just about to get lunch and then
  16025 6.94%:  really need to figure out how those science
  16026 6.94%:  like your idea better than ours
  16027 10.78%:  like your idea better than ours because
  16028 6.94%:  can totally see that being used in future block
  16029 6.94%:  think we just figured out the reason a lot
  16030 6.94%:  like your ideas better than the ones our
  16031 6.94%:  really need to think about this soon
  16032 6.94%:  should write a book about the one true
  16033 8.93%:  should write a book about the one true science
  16034 6.94%:  need to talk to you about being so
  16035 6.94%:  should write about that because if
  16036 6.94%:  think you just created one of the least logical
  16037 6.94%:  know nothing about the real
  16038 6.94%:  totally just thought of one
  16039 6.94%:  feel like that could be the science
  16040 6.94%:  think we found the secret to being a real cool
  16041 6.94%:  need to start telling
  16042 6.93%:  feel like you just changed the title
  16043 6.93%:  could totally see that being on the news for
  16044 6.97%:  could totally see that being on the news for a
  16045 6.93%:  think that would be really intense
  16046 6.93%:  was just about to argue the
  16047 12.23%:  was just about to argue the other
  16048 6.93%:  would like to be the first on your guest
  16049 6.93%:  really need to figure out what causes the
  16050 6.93%:  would like to see a theory about giant
  16051 6.93%:  just figured out the reason that we
  16052 6.93%:  think you need to be serious before
  16053 6.93%:  think you just wrote the correct
  16054 26.11%:  think you just wrote the correct ending
  16055 6.93%:  like how you said that last
  16056 6.93%:  thought you were abandon
  16057 6.93%:  think we just figured out the reason to call
  16058 6.93%:  like your ideas better where
  16059 6.93%:  really need to think about the last
  16060 6.93%:  think you just created real science out
  16061 87.01%:  think you just created real science out of nowhere
  16062 6.93%:  need to go write about this on
  16063 6.93%:  think you just altered science for real
  16064 6.93%:  think you just turned a boring
  16065 6.93%:  kinda
  16066 7.61%:  kinda want
  16067 28.18%:  kinda want that
  16068 607.95%:  kinda want that to be true!!
  16069 216.63%:  kinda want that to be true so
  16070 114.19%:  kinda want that to be the
  16071 99.26%:  kinda want that to be right
  16072 28.77%:  kinda want that to be correct
  16073 20.62%:  kinda want that to be right!!
  16074 16.27%:  kinda want that to be true enough
  16075 9.77%:  kinda want that to be true for
  16076 36.82%:  kinda want that to be true for science
  16077 10.74%:  kinda want that to be true for once
  16078 7.68%:  kinda want this
  16079 146.92%:  kinda want this to be true!!
  16080 130.87%:  kinda want this to be real
  16081 70.50%:  kinda want this to be true because
  16082 86.69%:  kinda want this to be true because then
  16083 59.74%:  kinda want this to be true so
  16084 35.31%:  kinda want this to be true too
  16085 33.95%:  kinda want this to be true just
  16086 29.87%:  kinda want this to be true because then you
  16087 23.38%:  kinda want this to be true too!!
  16088 21.51%:  kinda want this to be the
  16089 68.22%:  kinda want this to be the case too
  16090 46.05%:  kinda want this to be the case too!!
  16091 34.41%:  kinda want this to be the case!!
  16092 20.85%:  kinda want this to be true really
  16093 18.32%:  kinda want this to be true because of
  16094 48.45%:  kinda want this to be true because of the
  16095 25.50%:  kinda want this to be true because of the cool
  16096 17.81%:  kinda want this to be the correct
  16097 16.56%:  kinda want this to be true but
  16098 46.30%:  kinda want this to be true but also
  16099 15.92%:  kinda want this to be the case but
  16100 14.30%:  kinda want this to be real!!
  16101 13.70%:  kinda want this to be true just for
  16102 33.45%:  kinda want this to be true just for you
  16103 11.82%:  kinda want this to be true because holy
  16104 10.99%:  kinda want this to be the real

  16106 10.71%:  kinda want this to be real too
  16107 10.25%:  kinda want this to be the case for
  16108 10.22%:  kinda want this to be true because the
  16109 9.62%:  kinda want this to be true because then our
  16110 9.44%:  kinda want this to be the case for once
  16111 8.84%:  kinda want this to be real so
  16112 8.63%:  kinda want this to be true because there

  16118 9.42%:  kinda want this to be correct because then
  16119 7.17%:  kinda want this to be true real
  16120 7.03%:  kinda want this to be the real story of
  16121 6.92%:  thought you were a real life science bro and
  16122 22.47%:  thought you were a real life science bro and not
  16123 29.23%:  thought you were a real life science bro and not just
  16124 6.92%:  think you just created the best new alien
  16125 7.25%:  think you just created the best new alien race for
  16126 6.92%:  was totally right before but this could
  16127 6.92%:  need to think about this real fast or
  16128 6.92%:  need to get to the library before the local
  16129 6.92%:  really need to check out that new
  16130 6.92%:  think you just blew all science out the door
  16131 6.92%:  think you just got the answer to life and
  16132 6.92%:  need to get back to you about this in
  16133 6.92%:  feel like the only reason that answer
  16134 6.92%:  really need to check this out after
  16135 6.92%:  would like to be the first to get on
  16136 6.92%:  could totally see that being true because if we
  16137 6.92%:  feel like that should be way better at
  16138 6.92%:  think we just figured out that none
  16139 6.92%:  always liked that better
  16140 6.92%:  would like to be the first guy to see the
  16141 6.92%:  feel like this could be the correct answer about 
  16142 6.92%:  think that idea just got
  16143 6.91%:  really need to talk about this one
  16144 6.91%:  feel like that could be a serious theory!!
  16145 6.91%:  like your idea better than what
  16146 6.91%:  think you just lost
  16147 240.90%:  think you just lost the debate
  16148 131.70%:  think you just lost the debate!!
  16149 16.38%:  think you just lost the entire
  16150 9.52%:  think you just lost the debate before
  16151 8.14%:  think you just lost the debate on
  16152 7.26%:  think you just lost the bet
  16153 6.91%:  would like that to be the case in a
  16154 6.91%:  think you just found the rest
  16155 6.91%:  just had a really
  16156 13.33%:  just had a really intense
  16157 9.12%:  just had a really intense feeling
  16158 6.91%:  would like to hear your entire case
  16159 6.91%:  think that could be our best case for
  16160 8.63%:  think that could be our best case for giant
  16161 6.91%:  was just talking about food
  16162 6.91%:  need to write a book about this sort
  16163 6.91%:  really need to learn about the science of this!!
  16164 6.91%:  think you just got the last word in a
  16165 6.91%:  think you figured out another one
  16166 6.91%:  like this theory a lot better because we
  16167 6.91%:  think we figured out another one
  16168 6.91%:  just figured out the answer to reality!!
  16169 6.91%:  feel like that theory just needs
  16170 6.91%:  think you just won the science debate real
  16171 6.91%:  like your ideas about the
  16172 27.62%:  like your ideas about the nature
  16173 77.53%:  like your ideas about the nature of the cos
  16174 6.90%:  cannot breathe because you just killed the
  16175 6.90%:  just thought of a new nick
  16176 6.90%:  like this better than our
  16177 26.77%:  like this better than our actual
  16178 6.90%:  need to write that science story before
  16179 6.90%:  need to call the science guys about that like
  16180 6.90%:  should write a book about this you
  16181 6.90%:  just thought of a billion ways to turn
  16182 6.90%:  think you just started a whole
  16183 6.90%:  would like to hear about this after your
  16184 6.90%:  really need to learn science
  16185 6.90%:  just figured out where all this
  16186 6.90%:  need to talk to you about this so
  16187 6.90%:  really need to get back on this
  16188 9.09%:  really need to get back on this whole
  16189 53.16%:  really need to get back on this whole science
  16190 6.90%:  need to write a book about these funny
  16191 6.90%:  feel like this could be an honest
  16192 6.89%:  like this better than current
  16193 6.89%:  think you just found one
  16194 6.89%:  really should write that in
  16195 6.89%:  think you just brought down science to
  16196 6.89%:  think you just got an idea for what
  16197 6.89%:  think we just figured out the 
  16198 6.89%:  think you need to be careful about these sort
  16199 6.89%:  think you just created a new reason for the
  16200 6.89%:  just figured out the rest
  16201 6.89%:  think we just learned about the correct
  16202 6.89%:  need to write a book on this theory!!
  16203 6.89%:  need to talk to you later because right now i
  16204 6.89%:  need to talk to you about things in
  16205 6.89%:  need to write a book about all this one
  16206 6.88%:  need to write that book before the
  16207 6.88%:  think you just changed science to be better
  16208 6.88%:  need to write a story about ghost
  16209 6.88%:  really need to start asking for
  16210 6.88%:  like your friend better when she
  16211 6.88%:  think we should totally forget
  16212 43.82%:  think we should totally forget about
  16213 39.69%:  think we should totally forget about science
  16214 6.88%:  totally just figured out how there
  16215 6.88%:  need to talk to you about science because right
  16216 6.88%:  really need to get into that science show
  16217 6.88%:  feel like science should be about
  16218 6.88%:  thought about it for a second but only
  16219 6.88%:  need to get out of this kitchen
  16220 12.06%:  need to get out of this kitchen because
  16221 32.72%:  need to get out of this kitchen because clearly
  16222 6.88%:  can totally see how this could be true in ret
  16223 6.88%:  really need to look into that right now fr
  16224 6.88%:  can totally see that being the source for
  16225 6.88%:  can totally get on board with this one 
  16226 6.87%:  like your idea better now because of the last
  16227 6.87%:  was just about to thank you for being in
  16228 10.71%:  was just about to thank you for being in the
  16229 6.87%:  was just about to check out for today
  16230 6.87%:  really should think about being better
  16231 6.87%:  think that would be really nice
  16232 6.87%:  need to go think about this because no
  16233 6.87%:  really need to start working out so
  16234 6.87%:  need to write a book about this before he tells
  16235 6.87%:  should write about this later
  16236 6.87%:  think you just said the c
  16237 6.87%:  need to think about this later because for now you
  16238 6.87%:  like your idea better now because of all
  16239 8.60%:  like your idea better now because of all the ghost
  16240 6.87%:  was just about to correct you on the real
  16241 6.87%:  totally should write a science book for that
  16242 6.86%:  think you just found the real answer to great
  16243 6.86%:  really need to figure out how to not be such a jerk in
  16244 6.86%:  like your ideas better than all of
  16245 7.34%:  like your ideas better than all of the
  16246 6.86%:  guess you could take
  16247 31.72%:  guess you could take that to
  16248 10.88%:  guess you could take that into
  16249 6.86%:  really need to look into this further because u

  16251 6.86%:  really need to think about the rest
  16252 6.86%:  feel like you just wrote
  16253 15.66%:  feel like you just wrote science
  16254 10.86%:  feel like you just wrote the
  16255 19.66%:  feel like you just wrote the best
  16256 14.47%:  feel like you just wrote the ending
  16257 11.99%:  feel like you just wrote the ending to the
  16258 9.99%:  feel like you just wrote the best ending
  16259 9.01%:  feel like you just wrote that
  16260 28.17%:  feel like you just wrote that because
  16261 9.48%:  feel like you just wrote that because it
  16262 8.76%:  feel like you just wrote the ending to a
  16263 8.65%:  feel like you just wrote that entire
  16264 6.86%:  need to write about this before any other sc
  16265 6.86%:  guess you could call that one a work
  16266 6.86%:  feel like you just got one
  16267 6.86%:  could totally see that being true for a
  16268 6.86%:  thought it was because dark
  16269 6.86%:  like that
  16270 58.88%:  like that idea better

  16306 12.02%:  like that idea better too
  16307 11.81%:  like that idea because then we
  16308 11.77%:  like that theory best
  16309 157.36%:  like that theory best of all!!
  16310 109.34%:  like that theory best of all because
  16311 60.08%:  like that theory best of all because now
  16312 34.74%:  like that theory best because
  16313 11.52%:  like that theory because it gets
  16314 11.39%:  like that theory because it could
  16315 25.68%:  like that theory because it could also
  16316 102.70%:  like that theory because it could also be true
  16317 89.80%:  like that theory because it could also be true for
  16318 82.32%:  like that theory because it could also be true!!
  16319 69.15%:  like that theory because it could also be wrong

  16321 27.50%:  like that theory because it could also be wrong!!
  16322 11.22%:  like that theory because it conf
  16323 11.13%:  like that theory and
  16324 10.05%:  like that theory best of all so
  16325 9.98%:  like that idea better now
  16326 9.77%:  like that theory because it could be
  16327 26.38%:  like that theory because it could be true!!

  16335 9.31%:  like that theory best of all because now it
  16336 9.29%:  like that theory better because if
  16337 8.78%:  like that theory because if
  16338 8.69%:  like that idea better than our
  16339 8.25%:  like that better
  16340 18.38%:  like that better than
  16341 37.96%:  like that better than regular

  17090 6.75%:  just figured out how to be cool
  17091 6.75%:  think we just found all the science you
  17092 6.75%:  was just about to get to
  17093 6.75%:  like that theory better and now
  17094 6.75%:  think we just figured out the one reason to call
  17095 6.75%:  would like that to be the case but only in
  17096 6.75%:  would be totally into that one!!
  17097 6.75%:  think you just blew our entire general
  17098 6.75%:  think we just figured out an easy
  17099 6.74%:  think we found out about the real reason to
  17100 6.74%:  forgot to include that last one because when you
  17101 6.74%:  would like to be the first one to see a
  17102 6.74%:  cannot breathe right now because you told
  17103 6.74%:  would like to be the first to enjoy such

  17127 6.98%:  forgot about that one second because it
  17128 6.74%:  need to get to the library faster because now
  17129 6.74%:  need to write that story as
  17130 6.74%:  cannot think of a greater theory to
  17131 6.74%:  think you just found a reason to write the
  17132 6.74%:  need to talk to you about science later bro
  17133 6.74%:  think you just blew holes
  17134 6.74%:  can totally get behind that belief
  17135 6.74%:  need to get back into science so
  17136 6.74%:  think that sounds really real
  17137 6.74%:  think you just blew the entire secret of our
  17138 6.73%:  need to write a book about these scary
  17139 6.73%:  think you could write that on
  17140 6.73%:  think we just had a genius
  17141 6.73%:  think you just altered the entire reason

  17156 6.73%:  would like this theory to be true just for
  17157 6.73%:  really need to start looking for jobs in the
  17158 6.73%:  would like that to be correct because if not
  17159 6.73%:  could totally see that being taken
  17160 6.73%:  think we should be careful not to be too
  17161 12.24%:  think we should be careful not to be too certain
  17162 6.73%:  really need to know about this because the
  17163 6.73%:  feel like that could be a genuine

  17168 7.43%:  feel like that could be a genuine answer to your
  17169 6.73%:  really need to think of a better subject
  17170 8.36%:  really need to think of a better subject line
  17171 6.73%:  just thought of a new science related

  17197 15.07%:  totally just had the
  17198 6.72%:  think you found the secret to blowing
  17199 6.72%:  already know enough about science for this bro!!
  17200 6.72%:  can totally get with this!!

  17211 6.72%:  need to write a book about the one
  17212 6.72%:  feel like this could be a better theory about our
  17213 6.72%:  just figured that out on
  17214 9.82%:  just figured that out on the way
  17215 6.71%:  would like that to be the case but since
  17216 6.71%:  like this new theory better but
  17217 6.71%:  think you just blew the entire cos
  17218 6.71%:  really need to get back on that science bus
  17219 6.71%:  just thought of a reason to like

  17227 6.71%:  gotta write that book real
  17228 6.71%:  already know enough science to rule this
  17229 53.80%:  already know enough science to rule this out!!
  17230 6.71%:  feel like that theory is about
  17231 7.55%:  feel like that theory is about to
  17232 6.71%:  totally just had that
  17233 6.71%:  think we just found the secret true

  17355 41.82%:  think we just turned science
  17356 10.96%:  think we just turned science theory
  17357 6.66%:  really need to write that article soon
  17358 6.66%:  think we just found the real secret to being real
  17359 6.66%:  need to tell the science writers
  17360 7.93%:  need to tell the science writers about your
  17361 6.66%:  really need to figure out how to be the last one in
  17362 6.66%:  really think that sounds correct
  17363 6.66%:  can barely breathe right now but it
  17364 27.65%:  can barely breathe right now but it sounds
  17365 6.66%:  need to write a thesis on that one!!
  17366 6.65%:  need to write a book about this because only there
  17367 6.65%:  think you just got to the core of science and are
  17368 6.65%:  like that theory better because we can
  17369 6.65%:  would like to hear you argue that in
  17370 10.80%:  would like to hear you argue that in front
  17371 6.65%:  think you just created what

  17397 6.64%:  just thought of a billion new careers to
  17398 6.64%:  think you just changed all of science to better
  17399 6.64%:  need to write this one
  17400 6.64%:  should write a book about these ultra
  17401 6.64%:  cannot breathe right now due
  17402 6.64%:  think you just won science bro!!
  17403 6.64%:  would like to say that the fact

  17411 6.64%:  think you found the real answer because it
  17412 6.64%:  feel like that could be the secret to our
  17413 6.64%:  guess you could call that one for
  17414 6.64%:  always thought it could be a secret
  17415 6.64%:  think you just won the science debate for actual
  17416 6.63%:  feel like this could be true but
  17417 6.63%:  should write a book about just
  17418 19.95%:  should write a book about just that
  17419 6.63%:  think you just changed actual
  17420 6.63%:  need to start talking science

  17436 6.63%:  think you should go to
  17437 34.88%:  think you should go to science
  17438 6.63%:  should write that article
  17439 6.63%:  feel like that could be an honest
  17440 11.95%:  feel like that could be an honest answer
  17441 8.01%:  feel like that could be an honest answer to your
  17442 6.63%:  really should think about setting

  17448 6.62%:  feel like you just turned into an
  17449 6.62%:  really like that ending better than our
  17450 6.62%:  need to write about this because the
  17451 6.62%:  need to write a book about the science facts you
  17452 6.62%:  cannot breathe because of the genius!!
  17453 6.62%:  need to talk to this science guy!!
  17454 6.62%:  would like that to be the case because gi
  17455 6.62%:  really need to work on these science
  17456 6.62%:  really need to look into this because forget

  17458 6.62%:  think you just learned about how
  17459 35.47%:  think you just learned about how science
  17460 6.62%:  think you are correct and this
  17461 6.62%:  really need to get back to science faster!!
  17462 6.62%:  would like that to be the case to
  17463 8.73%:  would like that to be the case to be real

  17490 6.60%:  cannot breathe!!
  17491 6.60%:  should totally write about it!!
  17492 6.60%:  thought you wanted to learn about science for
  17493 6.60%:  need to write an article on these
  17494 6.60%:  think we just found our last
  17495 8.68%:  think we just found our last chance

  17497 8.14%:  think we just found our last chance to be
  17498 6.64%:  think we just found our last great
  17499 6.60%:  need to talk to you later about science for
  17500 6.60%:  think you just brought down a
  17501 14.26%:  think you just brought down a science
  17502 6.60%:  need to get to work on that one!!

  17504 6.60%:  think we just found our last chance to be cool
  17505 6.60%:  feel like that should count against your correct
  17506 6.60%:  think you just learned about science before we
  17507 6.60%:  really need to get on that before
  17508 6.59%:  think we should tell science about our great
  17509 6.59%:  think you just brought down all science for
  17510 6.59%:  totally forgot about the science because
  17511 6.59%:  guess you could write that on the back of cere
  17512 6.59%:  thought you were all about science facts too
  17513 6.59%:  think you just wrote an entire doctor
  17514 6.59%:  really need to start writing books!!
  17515 6.59%:  just thought of a really cool science idea but
  17516 23.80%:  just thought of a really cool science idea but now
  17517 6.59%:  would like to be the first to object!!
  17518 6.59%:  like your ideas better before we hang
  17519 16.04%:  like your ideas better before we hang out!!

  17523 6.59%:  really should know better than to act
  17524 6.59%:  guess you could tell
  17525 6.59%:  forgot about science!!
  17526 6.59%:  really need to figure out how to talk because
  17527 8.69%:  really need to figure out how to talk because this
  17528 6.58%:  need to get out of the house because all
  17529 6.58%:  need to go write science fan
  17530 6.58%:  would like to see that theory in greater
  17531 6.58%:  was just talking about theory of
  17532 6.58%:  need to get back into science after
  17533 6.58%:  need to get to the library because we
  17534 14.71%:  need to get to the library because we just
  17535 6.58%:  should write a book about this before any
  17536 6.58%:  need to write a book about these guys in the
  17537 6.58%:  need to write a book about giant secrets
  17538 6.58%:  really need to know about this soon!!
  17539 6.58%:  would like to hear your thesis before
  17540 6.58%:  feel like that would be easier to argue
  17541 6.58%:  need to write a science book about that for re
  17542 6.58%:  need to go think about that for real now!!
  17543 6.58%:  feel like that could be an entire theory
  17544 6.58%:  think you just hit on a real
  17545 6.57%:  would like to be there for that one!!
  17546 6.57%:  need to get to the nearest library like
  17547 6.57%:  need to think about your
  17548 6.57%:  would like that to be the case if only because ut
  17549 6.57%:  could totally see that being on the surface
  17550 6.57%:  think you just earned another title
  17551 19.19%:  think you just earned another title for
  17552 6.57%:  would like this to be the case better
  17553 6.57%:  thought you were like science
  17554 6.57%:  thought you were nice for once
  17555 6.57%:  think we just figured out the real reason tall
  17556 6.57%:  like this theory better because we couldn
  17557 6.57%:  think you need to sit
  17558 6.57%:  would like to be the one to say that our
  17559 12.29%:  would like to be the one to say that our science
  17560 6.57%:  guess that would account for the entire lack
  17561 6.57%:  thought nobody
  17562 6.57%:  like this story
  17563 203.86%:  like this story better than
  17564 63.50%:  like this story better than real
  17565 61.76%:  like this story better!!
  17566 36.12%:  like this story better when
  17567 20.61%:  like this story better than before

  17569 26.60%:  like this story better than our own
  17570 12.65%:  like this story better than all
  17571 12.14%:  like this story better than before!!
  17572 10.35%:  like this story better than our own!!
  17573 6.97%:  like this story better and
  17574 6.57%:  need to get to the library because who
  17575 6.57%:  just figured out another way to be the
  17576 6.57%:  think you just found a new secret
  17577 6.57%:  like your friends better than these
  17578 6.57%:  feel like you just changed the rules to a
  17579 6.56%:  need to get to the science library after all
  17580 6.56%:  really should check out
  17581 6.56%:  already know enough about this subject to be fore
  17582 6.56%:  think you just created a reason for the
  17583 6.56%:  need to talk to you about one
  17584 18.08%:  need to talk to you about one thing
  17585 11.67%:  need to talk to you about one thing because
  17586 6.56%:  would like to be the first one to say one
  17587 6.56%:  really need to write about
  17588 116.50%:  really need to write about this because
  17589 30.64%:  really need to write about this sooner
  17590 30.14%:  really need to write about this later
  17591 28.51%:  really need to write about this sooner than
  17592 21.45%:  really need to write about this before
  17593 15.59%:  really need to write about this because then
  17594 15.53%:  really need to write about these
  17595 188.07%:  really need to write about these things
  17596 22.30%:  really need to write about these things on
  17597 15.01%:  really need to write about this before the
  17598 14.09%:  really need to write about this one
  17599 12.71%:  really need to write about this later!!
  17600 11.13%:  really need to write about these things!!
  17601 9.33%:  really need to write about science
  17602 9.24%:  really need to write about this on
  17603 8.46%:  really need to write about that
  17604 8.70%:  really need to write about that one
  17605 8.29%:  really need to write about this on the blog
  17606 7.45%:  really need to write about these things for
  17607 6.67%:  really need to write about this sooner!!
  17608 6.56%:  think we just figured out the secret l
  17609 6.56%:  need to write a book about science theory fan
  17610 6.56%:  need to think about this later because before now
  17611 6.56%:  need to talk to you alone later!!
  17612 6.56%:  thought it was all just
  17613 6.56%:  need to write about that one!!
  17614 6.56%:  would like this theory to be fact
  17615 6.56%:  think you figured out another answer
  17616 6.56%:  should write a science book for that
  17617 6.56%:  think we figured out another reason you
  17618 6.55%:  would like that to be true enough to be an
  17619 6.55%:  think we just hit on a
  17620 8.07%:  think we just hit on a really
  17621 26.92%:  think we just hit on a really good
  17622 33.01%:  think we just hit on a really good reason
  17623 25.46%:  think we just hit on a really good reason for
  17624 9.69%:  think we just hit on a really great
  17625 8.47%:  think we just hit on a really good reason to be
  17626 6.55%:  think we found the last
  17627 6.55%:  really need to think about this one so
  17628 6.55%:  think you just won the debate because if
  17629 6.55%:  really think we just figured out one
  17630 6.55%:  really need to figure out the answers to the
  17631 6.55%:  would like to be the first to say here
  17632 6.55%:  need to write a book about all this so there
  17633 6.55%:  just figured out the secret to why
  17634 6.55%:  should totally write that one book!!
  17635 6.55%:  really need to figure out how to talk to a science
  17636 6.55%:  forgot about that theory like
  17637 6.55%:  feel like that could be the best reason not
  17638 6.55%:  guess you could write that in a book of
  17639 6.55%:  feel like you just went there
  17640 6.55%:  need to talk to you about those science
  17641 6.55%:  could totally see that being in the news for
  17642 6.55%:  would like that to be true only
  17643 58.01%:  would like that to be true only because
  17644 47.41%:  would like that to be true only because then
  17645 20.42%:  would like that to be true only because it changes
  17646 17.42%:  would like that to be true only because science
  17647 15.20%:  would like that to be true only because of
  17648 38.48%:  would like that to be true only because of the
  17649 14.23%:  would like that to be true only because the
  17650 10.81%:  would like that to be true only because there
  17651 10.16%:  would like that to be true only because it has
  17652 7.60%:  would like that to be true only because there is
  17653 6.75%:  would like that to be true only because if
  17654 6.55%:  really need to figure out how to access outer
  17655 6.55%:  guess that could be real but
  17656 8.81%:  guess that could be real but then
  17657 6.55%:  really need to figure out how to tie
  17658 6.55%:  really need to think about things before bl
  17659 6.55%:  need to get back to you on that one cause
  17660 6.55%:  can totally see how this could be an entire book
  17661 6.55%:  would like that to be the case if only because to be
  17662 6.55%:  should write sc
  17663 6.54%:  think we just found our best theory!!
  17664 6.54%:  can totally see that being in books
  17665 6.54%:  need to write a book about this one hurry
  17666 6.54%:  think that could easily account for our
  17667 6.54%:  think you just brought down all of ast
  17668 6.54%:  can totally see how this could be true once
  17669 6.54%:  already know enough about science to lose the
  17670 6.54%:  already know enough about this subject to be one
  17671 6.54%:  like that theory because it would let us
  17672 6.54%:  need to go think about that one for a w
  17673 6.54%:  think you need to be careful about what sorts
  17674 6.54%:  think we just created a science theory out
  17675 6.54%:  need to talk to you about this feeling when
  17676 6.54%:  need to call the news
  17677 14.53%:  need to call the news right
  17678 6.54%:  really should watch science
  17679 6.54%:  need to talk to the science guy about how
  17680 6.53%:  think we just learned about science baby
  17681 6.53%:  need to get on this theory train before
  17682 6.53%:  really need to think about this soon before
  17683 6.53%:  need to start looking into whether
  17684 6.53%:  guess that could account for all the non
  17685 6.53%:  really need to know about these things earlier!!
  17686 6.53%:  totally just thought of a new dark
  17687 6.53%:  need to talk to you about life because this
  17688 6.53%:  really need to figure out better
  17689 6.53%:  like your ideas better then!!
  17690 6.53%:  forgot about that one but
  17691 6.53%:  think we figured out the reason you

  18679 28.69%:  would like that to be a real science theory
  18680 7.67%:  would like that to be a thing!!
  18681 7.30%:  would like that to be a real thing but
  18682 7.12%:  would like that to be a real theory!!
  18683 7.01%:  would like that to be a serious theory about
  18684 6.80%:  would like that to be a real theory for
  18685 27.57%:  would like that to be a real theory for science
  18686 7.20%:  would like that to be a real theory for science to
  18687 6.69%:  would like that to be a real thing you
  18688 6.42%:  like how you started
  18689 6.42%:  guess that could totally be their
  18690 6.42%:  thought you were about to critic
  18691 6.42%:  feel like you just threw out a radical
  18692 6.42%:  need to figure out a way to cancel
  18693 8.81%:  need to figure out a way to cancel this
  18694 6.42%:  need to talk to you alone because we just got
  18695 6.41%:  need to write that on a stick
  18696 6.41%:  really need to know about this because right
  18697 6.41%:  need to write about this one!!
  18698 6.41%:  guess you could call that anti
  18699 6.41%:  think you just found the secret to being all
  18700 6.41%:  like your idea better now than before just
  18701 6.41%:  think you just blew all our science and the
  18702 6.41%:  need to think about those last four
  18703 6.41%:  need to talk to you about turning
  18704 6.41%:  think we just got closer to reality
  18705 6.41%:  could totally see that being a winner!!
  18706 6.41%:  need to write a science book as
  18707 6.41%:  really think we need
  18708 8.18%:  really think we need to figure
  18709 10.54%:  really think we need to figure out the
  18710 19.19%:  really think we need to figure out the nature
  18711 9.64%:  really think we need to figure that
  18712 136.75%:  really think we need to figure that out because
  18713 87.68%:  really think we need to figure that out sooner
  18714 36.19%:  really think we need to figure that out soon
  18715 615.95%:  really think we need to figure that out soon because
  18716 15.72%:  really think we need to figure that out soon!!
  18717 10.80%:  really think we need to figure that out!!
  18718 8.25%:  really think we need to figure that out real
  18719 7.29%:  really think we need to start
  18720 11.48%:  really think we need to start using
  18721 7.22%:  really think we need to figure out our
  18722 6.96%:  really think we need to get
  18723 39.15%:  really think we need to get on this because
  18724 35.26%:  really think we need to get on that
  18725 19.31%:  really think we need to get on this!!
  18726 18.00%:  really think we need to get on that because
  18727 14.04%:  really think we need to get on this before
  18728 12.73%:  really think we need to get on that!!
  18729 12.67%:  really think we need to get these
  18730 6.98%:  really think we need to get this
  18731 6.93%:  really think we need to get on that because if
  18732 6.93%:  really think we need to figure that out real soon
  18733 6.85%:  really think we need to start using the
  18734 6.41%:  need to talk to you about a secret
  18735 6.41%:  think you just won the genius
  18736 7.39%:  think you just won the genius lot
  18737 6.41%:  think that could be our best answer to
  18738 6.41%:  need to figure out a way to correct these
  18739 6.41%:  need to talk to you about this because in
  18740 6.41%:  really need to learn about things
  18741 63.96%:  really need to learn about things before
  18742 38.55%:  really need to learn about things other
  18743 16.86%:  really need to learn about things better
  18744 6.41%:  already know enough about the science to feel
  18745 6.41%:  should totally write a book about these being!!
  18746 6.41%:  need to go think about this for real because you
  18747 6.41%:  was just about to go there!!
  18748 6.41%:  need to write a book about these giant cos
  18749 6.41%:  think you need to be careful about all these new
  18750 6.41%:  already know enough about science for 
  18751 6.41%:  guess that would be true
  18752 6.40%:  think you just won the debate for real science!!
  18753 6.40%:  would like to see that on the screen of
  18754 6.40%:  think you just altered the course of gal
  18755 6.40%:  would like that to be true if you can
  18756 6.40%:  need to talk to you about science being
  18757 6.40%:  like your ideas better now because of the
  18758 6.40%:  need to get back to the future because holy
  18759 6.40%:  really need to figure out what the science books
  18760 6.40%:  just figured out the answer to all the black
  18761 6.40%:  totally forgot to include this one
  18762 10.61%:  totally forgot to include this one because
  18763 6.40%:  was just about to forget all
  18764 6.40%:  need to talk about this with you longer
  18765 26.41%:  need to talk about this with you longer because
  18766 6.40%:  think you just altered the laws of nature in
  18767 6.40%:  really need to think about this one for two
  18768 6.40%:  really need to figure out how to lie
  18769 36.12%:  really need to figure out how to lie better!!
  18770 9.32%:  really need to figure out how to lie better so
  18771 6.40%:  forgot about that too
  18772 6.74%:  forgot about that too because
  18773 6.40%:  think you just blew all our nation
  18774 6.40%:  need to think about this for real long because you
  18775 6.40%:  would like to be the first one to hug
  18776 6.40%:  need to think about that so
  18777 6.40%:  would like to be the first one to touch
  18778 6.39%:  need to think about this for a sec real
  18779 6.39%:  really need to get back into this
  18780 6.39%:  think you just won another debate because
  18781 6.39%:  think we found our science teacher!!
  18782 6.39%:  think we just figured out the real reason c
  18783 6.39%:  gotta write that book because
  18784 6.39%:  should totally write a science f
  18785 6.39%:  think you just created the worst fan
  18786 6.39%:  thought you were all about science and not like
  18787 6.39%:  think you should get a job at science central
  18788 6.39%:  really need to get back to this later!!
  18789 6.39%:  think you just got the best idea we
  18790 6.39%:  was just about to argue they don
  18791 6.39%:  would like that to be the case if only because our con
  18792 6.39%:  feel like this theory could be correct but at
  18793 6.39%:  need to write a book before that
  18794 12.66%:  need to write a book before that theory
  18795 10.91%:  need to write a book before that theory can
  18796 10.14%:  need to write a book before that theory is
  18797 9.79%:  need to write a book before that guy
  18798 9.19%:  need to write a book before that theory gains
  18799 6.39%:  really should write that book faster
  18800 6.39%:  think you figured out the real reasons
  18801 6.39%:  need to go think about that all
  18802 6.39%:  really need to know about that sooner!!
  18803 6.39%:  should totally write a book on giants then!!
  18804 6.38%:  can barely breathe right now due
  18805 6.38%:  would like that to be true because then gi
  18806 6.38%:  forgot to check that idea
  18807 13.75%:  forgot to check that idea because
  18808 6.38%:  need to figure out a way to turn this all
  18809 6.38%:  think you just found the secret to win
  18810 6.38%:  think you just won the contest called
  18811 6.38%:  totally think this
  18812 19.29%:  totally think this could
  18813 51.19%:  totally think this could be true because
  18814 26.64%:  totally think this could be true because now
  18815 17.42%:  totally think this could be correct
  18816 12.06%:  totally think this could be true now
  18817 11.89%:  totally think this could be correct!!
  18818 9.43%:  totally think this could be true now because
  18819 7.73%:  totally think this could be true because of
  18820 6.38%:  just figured out where that
  18821 6.38%:  really need to look into this after we hang out!!
  18822 6.38%:  need to write a book about all these future
  18823 6.38%:  really need to figure out how to not be racist
  18824 6.38%:  think you just found the secret to bring
  18825 6.38%:  need to get to the library before it closes can
  18826 6.38%:  really need to get on the science bus
  18827 6.38%:  can totally see that being true when
  18828 6.38%:  was just about to critic
  18829 6.38%:  need to think about this for longer but also
  18830 6.38%:  would like to be the first to the
  18831 6.38%:  just thought of a new science lecture
  18832 6.37%:  think you just created one of the science
  18833 6.37%:  think you just got the first real clue!!
  18834 6.37%:  would like to be the first guy that
  18835 6.37%:  would like to see science that
  18836 6.37%:  can totally see how that could be our origin
  18837 6.37%:  would like to see your source for that being that
  18838 6.37%:  think you just got the science to
  18839 6.37%:  need to talk to you about this fr
  18840 6.37%:  feel like that theory could be true!!
  18841 6.37%:  would like to see your face
  18842 18.77%:  would like to see your face right
  18843 11.93%:  would like to see your face right about
  18844 6.37%:  should write a book about that for teens
  18845 6.37%:  think that could totally be a new
  18846 6.37%:  need to write a book about these science f
  18847 6.37%:  think this could be your new
  18848 7.29%:  think this could be your new career
  18849 7.21%:  think this could be your new best
  18850 6.37%:  need to go write a science book so
  18851 6.37%:  need to figure out how that science
  18852 6.37%:  feel like this could be the best new
  18853 6.36%:  guess you could write that in a book for later
  18854 6.36%:  really need to figure out how to turn into
  18855 6.36%:  would like to be the one to say that if so
  18856 6.36%:  think you figured out the secret at
  18857 6.36%:  forgot to include that tiny
  18858 24.79%:  forgot to include that tiny chance
  18859 16.26%:  forgot to include that tiny chance!!
  18860 6.36%:  think we should be careful about trying to create
  18861 6.36%:  need to figure out how to teach science so
  18862 6.36%:  guess that would account for their near
  18863 6.36%:  need to figure out how this connect
  18864 6.36%:  just figured out what those
  18865 6.36%:  really think we should test
  18866 6.36%:  guess that would be cool
  18867 6.36%:  need to write a book about that science before
  18868 6.36%:  need to write this book because
  18869 8.91%:  need to write this book because clearly
  18870 6.36%:  just had the first real
  18871 6.36%:  was just about to credit you for not calling
  18872 6.36%:  need to think about this sober
  18873 6.36%:  forgot to include that because then you
  18874 6.36%:  should write a book about that being true!!
  18875 6.36%:  think we just had our first counter
  18876 6.36%:  think you just changed all our science for re
  18877 6.36%:  would like that to be true because then if anyone
  18878 6.36%:  need to start saying that line
  18879 6.36%:  like that theory because if true
  18880 6.36%:  need to talk to you about this because where
  18881 6.36%:  need to go think about science for a sec
  18882 6.36%:  already know enough about this subject to circle
  18883 6.35%:  was just about to eat lunch before
  18884 6.35%:  would like to be the first to create such
  18885 6.35%:  think you just blew all our chances of being cred
  18886 6.35%:  need to write an article about secret
  18887 6.35%:  need to think about that for science!!
  18888 6.35%:  think you could be right about all
  18889 6.35%:  forgot about that theory because science will
  18890 6.35%:  need to go think about this on a
  18891 6.35%:  cannot breathe because you just took
  18892 6.35%:  think we just figured out a central reason
  18893 6.35%:  really like that ending better than before!!
  18894 6.35%:  really need to figure out how to use that in a screen
  18895 6.35%:  would like that to be the case if only because true
  18896 6.35%:  need to write about science
  18897 6.35%:  always thought it could be rocks
  18898 6.35%:  really need to think about it for longer
  18899 6.35%:  really need to write this book because
  18900 6.35%:  would like to be the first one to laugh about
  18901 6.35%:  just figured out another reason to be into
  18902 6.35%:  feel like you should write that out
  18903 6.35%:  think you need to tell that science
  18904 6.35%:  just thought of a counter to
  18905 6.35%:  thought about it earlier
  18906 13.07%:  thought about it earlier today
  18907 6.35%:  feel like there should be an arrow
  18908 6.34%:  need to figure out a way to sell that one
  18909 6.34%:  think you need to tell science about these cool
  18910 6.34%:  need to talk to you about this for real!!
  18911 6.34%:  would like to see this theory better
  18912 6.34%:  was just trying to tell
  18913 6.34%:  would like that to be correct enough to say
  18914 6.34%:  just thought of one counter
  18915 6.34%:  would like that to be correct for
  18916 6.34%:  can totally see this working out for our
  18917 6.34%:  think we just found out this
  18918 6.34%:  could totally see that working in the absence
  18919 6.34%:  need to write a book before anyone gets
  18920 17.97%:  need to write a book before anyone gets that
  18921 11.40%:  need to write a book before anyone gets this
  18922 6.34%:  just figured out the real reason they call it non
  18923 6.34%:  need to figure out what science has
  18924 9.12%:  need to figure out what science has been
  18925 6.34%:  really need to figure out how to take a science
  18926 6.34%:  think you figured out the real answers
  18927 6.34%:  need to know about this theory before it
  18928 6.34%:  like this theory better and we
  18929 6.34%:  think we found the secret source
  18930 6.33%:  just thought of a way science could be real broken
  18931 6.33%:  think you just got the best idea for a real
  18932 6.33%:  think you just rewrote the ending for
  18933 6.33%:  need to write a book about the science of al
  18934 6.33%:  guess that could be one of
  18935 6.38%:  guess that could be one of the billion
  18936 6.33%:  think we just found out tonight
  18937 6.33%:  really need to figure out how to store
  18938 9.71%:  really need to figure out how to store this
  18939 6.33%:  think we just found the secret to really being
  18940 6.33%:  need to write a book about such gi
  18941 40.05%:  need to write a book about such giants!!
  18942 23.47%:  need to write a book about such giants before
  18943 10.87%:  need to write a book about such giants before they
  18944 6.33%:  can totally see that one showing
  18945 6.33%:  should write a book about science but that
  18946 6.33%:  would like that to be true enough to be a real
  18947 6.33%:  need to go think about this alone for just
  18948 6.33%:  need to get back to you after
  18949 6.33%:  feel like we just ruined
  18950 17.51%:  feel like we just ruined the
  18951 9.45%:  feel like we just ruined the theory
  18952 6.33%:  guess that could be another way of
  18953 6.33%:  was just about to find
  18954 13.22%:  was just about to find out!!
  18955 7.26%:  was just about to find another
  18956 6.32%:  feel like that could be the entire
  18957 6.32%:  really need to start taking those
  18958 6.32%:  was just about to get dinner!!
  18959 6.32%:  feel like you just threw out an idea that belongs on
  18960 6.32%:  like that better because
  18961 7.25%:  like that better because it doesn
  18962 6.32%:  feel like you just ruined a secret that
  18963 6.32%:  think you need to be careful calling
  18964 6.32%:  really should be writing for
  18965 12.26%:  really should be writing for the
  18966 6.32%:  feel like you just said the c
  18967 6.32%:  need to figure out how to talk about science here!!
  18968 6.32%:  need to figure out how to start a science lab
  18969 6.32%:  forgot to check that one yet
  18970 7.86%:  forgot to check that one yet because
  18971 6.32%:  can totally see that being shown
  18972 6.32%:  need to think about this for about ele
  18973 6.32%:  think we just found the coolest guy in
  18974 6.32%:  think you just rewrote all of science and are the
  18975 6.32%:  would like to be the first to be jealous
  18976 6.32%:  was totally just about to be done being
  18977 6.32%:  really need to check that article
  18978 21.84%:  really need to check that article out!!
  18979 19.32%:  really need to check that article out before
  18980 16.09%:  really need to check that article out now
  18981 12.94%:  really need to check that article out soon
  18982 12.05%:  really need to check that article out sooner
  18983 9.71%:  really need to check that article out now!!
  18984 6.97%:  really need to check that article before
  18985 6.75%:  really need to check that article out soon!!
  18986 6.32%:  really need to figure out how to talk about sc
  18987 6.32%:  totally forgot about this whole
  18988 15.96%:  totally forgot about this whole dark
  18989 6.32%:  really need to figure out what the real
  18990 6.32%:  need to think about this because now all of
  18991 6.32%:  think you just ruined the last two
  18992 6.32%:  feel like that could be the answer to too
  18993 6.31%:  think you could write that on a fortune
  18994 6.31%:  need to think about that science for
  18995 6.31%:  feel like you just created a giant
  18996 7.18%:  feel like you just created a giant hole
  18997 6.31%:  need to tell you about this later because for once in
  18998 6.31%:  guess you could write that in the book
  18999 6.31%:  think you should write a letter to an
  19000 6.31%:  need to think of a way to tell
  19001 6.31%:  really need to figure out how to talk about science 
  19002 6.31%:  already know enough science to rule these
  19003 6.31%:  think you found the answer to our cos
  19004 6.31%:  think you just got the award for best bro
  19005 6.31%:  was totally gonna use the
  19006 6.31%:  thought you were a real friend to science but
  19007 6.31%:  guess that would be the one counter
  19008 6.31%:  really need to figure out how to talk out
  19009 6.31%:  need to write a book about these real flying
  19010 6.31%:  just learned about that three
  19011 14.86%:  just learned about that three weeks
  19012 6.31%:  guess that would account for that
  19013 6.76%:  guess that would account for that one
  19014 6.31%:  need to call the science library about
  19015 8.70%:  need to call the science library about these
  19016 6.31%:  totally forgot about this science
  19017 6.31%:  need to go write a book about this fr
  19018 6.30%:  need to figure out how to say that is

  19037 6.30%:  totally just learned about this in
  19038 6.30%:  was just about to call you on being
  19039 6.30%:  think we should totally go out for
  19040 12.30%:  think we should totally go out for ice
  19041 6.30%:  feel like that could be the answer!!

  19084 6.29%:  feel like that idea just got closer
  19085 6.29%:  feel like the answer is no but that
  19086 6.29%:  think you just changed all our science fore
  19087 6.29%:  think we just figured out the core reason to
  19088 6.28%:  already know enough science to rule this out before

  19099 12.44%:  was totally just gonna end the
  19100 8.29%:  was totally just gonna end there
  19101 6.28%:  like your idea better now than before but also the
  19102 6.28%:  should write a book about the science of really
  19103 6.28%:  need to think about this to be
  19104 14.02%:  need to think about this to be sure!!
  19105 6.28%:  feel like you just changed the real answer
  19106 8.68%:  feel like you just changed the real answer into
  19107 6.28%:  think we just figured out the real reason not all
  19108 6.28%:  think you just won another debate because of
  19109 6.27%:  would like that to be true because it feels
  19110 6.27%:  really need to look into that because now there
  19111 6.27%:  really need to figure out what is
  19112 6.27%:  need to write a book about these just
  19113 6.27%:  just thought of a new science career and
  19114 6.27%:  need to talk to you about things before we share
  19115 6.27%:  totally forgot about these
  19116 6.27%:  need to think about this for way long

  19126 9.69%:  need to figure out where they store all
  19127 6.27%:  think you just rewrote science to reflect
  19128 6.27%:  think that would be really nice because
  19129 6.27%:  really need to look into this better before
  19130 6.27%:  could totally see that being a winner of
  19131 6.27%:  need to write an article about these guys for
  19132 6.27%:  need to go write about this because clearly the

  19188 6.25%:  need to think about this later because woo
  19189 6.25%:  think you just got to the core of all science and we
  19190 6.25%:  think we should totally go into
  19191 7.58%:  think we should totally go into outer
  19192 6.25%:  need to write a book series about that or
  19193 6.25%:  forgot about that one theory
  19194 12.37%:  forgot about that one theory because
  19195 6.25%:  totally just thought of a new science idea on
  19196 6.25%:  need to figure out how to call that
  19197 8.67%:  need to figure out how to call that science
  19198 6.25%:  like your idea better better

  19209 7.08%:  need to start taking notes before you blow
  19210 6.24%:  feel like that could be the answer to not
  19211 6.24%:  need to talk to you about science before it
  19212 6.24%:  need to write a book on this before the
  19213 6.24%:  thought about it for like two seconds real
  19214 6.24%:  gotta write this story!!
  19215 6.24%:  really should know better than to ignore a
  19216 6.24%:  really need to learn about science but
  19217 6.24%:  can totally see this being an
  19218 6.24%:  feel like you just threw out an idea better
  19219 6.24%:  need to talk to you later about our science beliefs!!

  19229 6.24%:  need to get on that because
  19230 6.24%:  think you should go on about
  19231 6.24%:  think you just created a science better

  19239 11.78%:  think we just figured out nearly all there
  19240 6.23%:  think that would count as a science
  19241 6.23%:  thought you wanted to be serious for a bit
  19242 6.23%:  would like that to be the case but only because one
  19243 6.23%:  think you just found the new cool

  19245 6.23%:  would like to note
  19246 170.69%:  would like to note that this
  19247 16.67%:  would like to note that your

  19266 12.26%:  would like to note that the science
  19267 6.65%:  would like to note that if anyone
  19268 6.53%:  would like to note that you are the one
  19269 6.23%:  really need to think about this long after
  19270 6.23%:  think you just wrote a science fan
  19271 6.23%:  just thought of a really rad
  19272 11.88%:  just thought of a really rad science
  19273 6.23%:  think we just found the real giant
  19274 6.23%:  think you just blew a hole into
  19275 6.22%:  totally just heard science
  19276 6.39%:  totally just heard science talking
  19277 6.22%:  think that would be a little
  19278 6.22%:  need to write a science book about the theory
  19279 6.22%:  think you should be a winner
  19280 6.22%:  think we just found a totally
  19281 6.65%:  think we just found a totally real
  19282 30.55%:  think we just found a totally real thing
  19283 17.40%:  think we just found a totally real thing!!

  19300 18.15%:  should totally write a book about seeing the
  19301 6.22%:  think we just learned about the reason
  19302 6.22%:  would really rather not think about just
  19303 6.22%:  think you just got turned onto
  19304 6.22%:  think you just blew science out of an
  19305 6.22%:  like your ideas better than the ones real
  19306 6.22%:  think we just found the real reason gi
  19307 6.22%:  need to write a book about this ut
  19308 6.22%:  really need to look into that further now

  19317 6.21%:  think you just wrote a screen
  19318 6.21%:  think you just earned a science lecture!!
  19319 6.21%:  need to figure out how to contain
  19320 6.21%:  think we just found the secret to really long
  19321 6.21%:  think we just found the current
  19322 6.21%:  feel like this has been done

  19324 6.21%:  need to write a book about the subject!!
  19325 6.21%:  need to write a book about these fancy gi
  19326 6.21%:  would like that to be correct because then our
  19327 6.21%:  totally forgot about science and
  19328 6.22%:  totally forgot about science and now
  19329 6.21%:  need to get to work on this because clearly it
  19330 6.21%:  really should know better than to sit
  19331 6.21%:  need to think about that for once
  19332 6.21%:  need to get out of your house as
  19333 6.20%:  was just talking to you about it
  19334 6.20%:  forgot to write
  19335 7.39%:  forgot to write that in
  19336 6.20%:  would like to be the first to say there can
  19337 6.20%:  can totally see where this could be taking
  19338 6.20%:  really need to figure out how to talk so
  19339 6.20%:  like where your head is at for
  19340 19.39%:  like where your head is at for once!!
  19341 6.20%:  would like that to be the case also
  19342 6.20%:  just learned about that like
  19343 24.68%:  just learned about that like three
  19344 10.80%:  just learned about that like two
  19345 25.68%:  just learned about that like two hours
  19346 6.20%:  think we just had a real
  19347 6.20%:  like your friends!!
  19348 6.20%:  think we just created a theory for all
  19349 6.20%:  really need to figure out how to use that as
  19350 6.20%:  think we just figured out a really cool reason the
  19351 6.20%:  would like to say that if there are
  19352 6.20%:  just thought of a way to ruin
  19353 27.28%:  just thought of a way to ruin science
  19354 15.30%:  just thought of a way to ruin science and
  19355 11.19%:  just thought of a way to ruin science!!
  19356 6.20%:  was totally just about to go in
  19357 6.20%:  need to write a book about the future
  19358 6.20%:  would like to be the first one to say there can
  19359 6.20%:  think you figured out how to create a
  19360 6.20%:  think you just got the science award for all
  19361 6.20%:  would like this theory to be correct as
  19362 6.20%:  just figured out how they
  19363 6.19%:  really need to get out of the house!!
  19364 6.19%:  think we need to get this
  19365 6.19%:  just thought of a better answer and
  19366 6.19%:  need to think about this later because for re
  19367 6.19%:  need to write a book about this faster!!
  19368 6.19%:  need to think about this longer to be
  19369 13.45%:  need to think about this longer to be sure!!
  19370 6.19%:  need to figure out how to take you
  19371 6.19%:  thought you said it was a
  19372 6.19%:  totally forgot about this earlier
  19373 6.19%:  need to figure out how to react to such an
  19374 6.19%:  would like to note that there are serious
  19375 6.19%:  could totally write a book about just
  19376 6.19%:  feel like this could be an answer to one
  19377 6.19%:  really need to talk to these gi
  19378 67.90%:  really need to talk to these giants before
  19379 25.45%:  really need to talk to these giants!!
  19380 6.19%:  really think we just figured out the secret balance
  19381 6.19%:  need to check into that one
  19382 6.19%:  guess that would be one theory about
  19383 6.19%:  think you just got us all into
  19384 11.14%:  think you just got us all into another
  19385 9.68%:  think you just got us all into the
  19386 6.19%:  need to get to work on that one because
  19387 6.19%:  think you just created the best genre
  19388 6.18%:  need to write an entire book just to call you a
  19389 6.18%:  need to talk to you about all of these science
  19390 6.18%:  think we just figured out the secret cab
  19391 6.18%:  should write about that one because
  19392 6.18%:  need to talk to you about the serious
  19393 6.18%:  really need to figure out how to cancel our
  19394 6.18%:  need to talk to this theory alone
  19395 6.18%:  thought you were a real friend just
  19396 6.18%:  think you just blew our chance at seeing
  19397 6.18%:  totally just figured out the real reason non
  19398 6.18%:  need to think about this before we can go
  19399 6.18%:  just figured out the answer to the all
  19400 6.18%:  need to tell you about this new book
  19401 6.18%:  think you figured out how to absorb
  19402 6.18%:  can totally see that being used for the
  19403 6.18%:  would like this theory to be false but
  19404 6.18%:  think you just blew this one outta
  19405 6.18%:  think we found the reason you get
  19406 6.18%:  thought you were all science and facts until
  19407 6.18%:  think you just rewrote the ending to a
  19408 6.18%:  feel like we just learned the
  19409 29.60%:  feel like we just learned the truth
  19410 6.18%:  would like that to be a reality
  19411 6.18%:  feel like that could be a correct
  19412 54.38%:  feel like that could be a correct answer to
  19413 132.30%:  feel like that could be a correct answer to this
  19414 54.17%:  feel like that could be a correct answer!!
  19415 51.84%:  feel like that could be a correct theory
  19416 32.57%:  feel like that could be a correct theory about
  19417 19.21%:  feel like that could be a correct theory!!
  19418 19.05%:  feel like that could be a correct answer but
  19419 9.62%:  feel like that could be a correct answer to the
  19420 8.54%:  feel like that could be a correct answer but it
  19421 6.42%:  feel like that could be a correct answer to one
  19422 6.18%:  would like that to be the case but no because
  19423 6.18%:  feel like this could be the one true
  19424 6.18%:  was just about to call it
  19425 6.17%:  need to write that science book before
  19426 13.85%:  need to write that science book before you
  19427 6.17%:  think we just changed science by
  19428 6.17%:  was just trying to be nice about
  19429 6.17%:  need to talk to you about where these
  19430 6.17%:  think this calls for a brand
  19431 6.17%:  already know enough about this one!!
  19432 6.17%:  really need to write a book that
  19433 6.17%:  think you need to tell science about the
  19434 6.17%:  think you just brought science too far!!
  19435 6.17%:  think we just figured out the one eternal
  19436 6.17%:  totally just figured out how to be rich
  19437 6.17%:  would like to be the first one to hear a
  19438 6.17%:  think you just created another science to
  19439 6.17%:  feel like that could be the answer to one tiny
  19440 6.17%:  could totally see that being true for sure
  19441 6.16%:  really need to figure out which colours
  19442 6.16%:  think you should go see
  19443 6.16%:  feel like we should just agree
  19444 6.16%:  think that was
  19445 6.16%:  think you just created a new science there
  19446 6.16%:  think we just figured out the only role
  19447 6.16%:  think we finally just
  19448 6.16%:  need to start taking notes for
  19449 6.16%:  really need to figure out how to listen because
  19450 6.16%:  think this could totally be a great
  19451 6.16%:  think you just created the coolest being of
  19452 6.16%:  feel like that could be an answer to this
  19453 6.16%:  like this theory better because no longer
  19454 6.16%:  think you just created science for real!!
  19455 6.16%:  need to figure out this theory real
  19456 6.16%:  would like to be the first to con
  19457 6.16%:  like that theory best because it conf
  19458 6.16%:  can totally see how that science
  19459 6.16%:  just totally figured out how to be
  19460 6.15%:  need to write about that on
  19461 6.15%:  guess that theory could be correct but
  19462 6.15%:  kinda want this to be the reason
  19463 6.87%:  kinda want this to be the reason for
  19464 6.15%:  think you just found the real title
  19465 6.15%:  need to write science books before
  19466 6.15%:  feel like that could be the worst reason
  19467 11.81%:  feel like that could be the worst reason anyone
  19468 6.15%:  need to go think about that for science
  19469 6.15%:  like your idea better now than the real
  19470 15.85%:  like your idea better now than the real one!!
  19471 6.15%:  think you just settled
  19472 6.15%:  really need to get back in touch with our
  19473 6.15%:  would like this to be true enough to be canon
  19474 6.15%:  need to figure out a better answer
  19475 6.15%:  really think that could be our
  19476 13.25%:  really think that could be our best
  19477 13.28%:  really think that could be our best answer
  19478 11.48%:  really think that could be our answer
  19479 6.15%:  think we just found the secret to being bro
  19480 6.15%:  feel like we just changed the rules on you
  19481 6.15%:  would like to see that theory be
  19482 6.15%:  need to write this book before anyone gets
  19483 6.15%:  need to talk to you about when
  19484 6.15%:  think that would count as being really
  19485 6.15%:  like this theory better because all
  19486 6.15%:  really need to get on this one
  19487 6.15%:  think you just changed all our beliefs to be correct at
  19488 6.15%:  think you need to get better
  19489 6.14%:  think your friend
  19490 7.32%:  think your friend just
  19491 7.66%:  think your friend just blew
  19492 6.14%:  think you just found a new career to
  19493 6.14%:  feel like you just threw out the cool
  19494 377.30%:  feel like you just threw out the coolest idea
  19495 9.72%:  feel like you just threw out the coolest ending
  19496 6.14%:  need to think about that for longer because you
  19497 6.14%:  thought about it for a second but now
  19498 6.14%:  really need to think about life
  19499 6.14%:  just threw
  19500 6.14%:  think you just created a new science about
  19501 6.14%:  need to tell you about science before this
  19502 6.14%:  think you just created an entire secret
  19503 6.14%:  cannot think of a better way to choose
  19504 6.14%:  should write a book about the only
  19505 9.24%:  should write a book about the only science
  19506 6.35%:  should write a book about the only subject
  19507 6.14%:  think you need to tell science what
  19508 6.14%:  really should be writing sc
  19509 6.14%:  think you just ruined two of

  19630 6.14%:  think we just learned the secret nature
  19631 6.14%:  could totally write a book about these being
  19632 6.14%:  need to write this fan theory
  19633 6.14%:  already know enough about science to lose the title
  19634 6.14%:  need to figure out how to see that because
  19635 6.14%:  need to get on that theory sooner
  19636 6.14%:  need to think about this one a lot!!
  19637 6.14%:  need to think about this one too because
  19638 6.13%:  really should know about science better for
  19639 6.13%:  cannot breathe right now because for
  19640 6.13%:  like that theory best of all and
  19641 6.13%:  need to get out of this house now!!
  19642 6.13%:  just thought of a new science book about
  19643 6.13%:  was totally looking into that one
  19644 6.13%:  think we should all go out
  19645 6.13%:  need to write a book about these guys but
  19646 6.13%:  need to write a book about this because for re
  19647 6.13%:  need to figure out how these
  19648 6.13%:  really need to write a book about it!!
  19649 6.13%:  really think we should focus on being better at
  19650 6.13%:  should totally write that one in
  19651 6.13%:  need to write that on a black
  19652 6.13%:  just figured out the answer to ancient r
  19653 6.13%:  need to write a book about all the things only
  19654 6.13%:  think you should write a feature
  19655 9.74%:  think you should write a feature screen
  19656 6.13%:  would like to be the one to correct
  19657 8.53%:  would like to be the one to correct the
  19658 6.13%:  would be totally into that science!!
  19659 6.13%:  would like to be the first one to y
  19660 6.13%:  forgot to include this because there
  19661 6.13%:  forgot to include that because there aren
  19662 6.12%:  should write a book about this but only later!!
  19663 6.12%:  really need to figure out how to let this
  19664 6.12%:  forgot about that because nobody list
  19665 6.12%:  thought you were under
  19666 6.12%:  really need to figure out how to count these
  19667 6.12%:  think you just created the coolest regular
  19668 6.12%:  totally just learned about the science of our own
  19669 6.12%:  feel like that should be written as
  19670 6.12%:  feel like you just changed the answer to our
  19671 6.12%:  can totally see that working for sure
  19672 6.12%:  really need to look into this further because g
  19673 6.12%:  already know enough about science to be bother
  19674 6.12%:  like your ideas better than that one!!
  19675 6.12%:  think you just rewrote the big
  19676 6.12%:  need to talk to you about life changes
  19677 6.12%:  could totally see that being on an
  19678 6.12%:  think you just changed real life to be better!!
  19679 6.12%:  need to start writing books before
  19680 7.51%:  need to start writing books before they
  19681 6.12%:  need to write about these guys in
  19682 6.12%:  already know enough about the science to be sure
  19683 6.12%:  need to think about this later because only
  19684 6.12%:  guess that could be real then
  19685 6.12%:  was just about to correct you there
  19686 6.12%:  think we just found the science lecture
  19687 6.12%:  need to think about this for way longer so let
  19688 6.11%:  really need to figure out what this book
  19689 6.11%:  need to figure out how to sell that in
  19690 13.62%:  need to figure out how to sell that in a screen
  19691 6.11%:  should write about that in a story
  19692 6.11%:  would like to be the first guy to turn
  19693 6.11%:  need to talk to you later about where science is
  19694 6.11%:  feel like that could be true because that is
  19695 6.11%:  think we just changed science to
  19696 6.11%:  think we figured out the last
  19697 7.84%:  think we figured out the last secret
  19698 6.11%:  think we just found the actual reality
  19699 6.11%:  really need to look into that because there is now
  19700 6.11%:  like your idea better now than before but let
  19701 6.11%:  need to write this book faster!!
  19702 6.11%:  need to write a book about these air
  19703 6.11%:  can totally see this working out for real
  19704 6.11%:  should totally write a book for the science ner
  19705 6.11%:  feel like that could be the correct answer to an un
  19706 6.11%:  think we just found the least logical
  19707 6.11%:  would like this to be correct because then you get
  19708 6.11%:  would like to be the first on the scene to be
  19709 6.11%:  really need to figure out how to silence those
  19710 6.11%:  would like that to be true if only because the reason no
  19711 6.11%:  can totally see where that got
  19712 6.10%:  really need to start working out because then
  19713 6.10%:  need to write a science book real fast to tell you
  19714 6.10%:  think we found the secret science
  19715 6.10%:  feel like we should be science
  19716 6.10%:  need to figure out how to bet
  19717 43.45%:  need to figure out how to bet on this
  19718 31.56%:  need to figure out how to bet on this because
  19719 24.71%:  need to figure out how to bet on this because clearly
  19720 13.13%:  need to figure out how to bet on this!!
  19721 6.10%:  really need to learn about science to be this
  19722 6.10%:  should write a book about all this you
  19723 6.10%:  really need to think about this larger
  19724 6.10%:  think you just got to the core of a
  19725 6.10%:  guess that could be real after
  19726 6.10%:  really need to figure out what colour that non
  19727 6.10%:  think you just found a great science career
  19728 6.10%:  think we just found the true reason to go
  19729 6.10%:  need to think about that for years now!!
  19730 6.10%:  need to think about that because of
  19731 48.36%:  need to think about that because of course
  19732 6.10%:  really need to think about this a lot before we
  19733 6.10%:  need to think about this for longer but yes
  19734 6.09%:  would like to note that there is a
  19735 15.25%:  would like to note that there is a reason
  19736 6.09%:  think you just rewrote science and brought
  19737 6.09%:  feel like this could be a better answer
  19738 6.09%:  just figured out what they
  19739 12.07%:  just figured out what they are
  19740 9.26%:  just figured out what they call
  19741 6.09%:  think you just ruined all the cool secret
  19742 6.09%:  think you should be careful not to be so
  19743 6.09%:  like your friend better now that
  19744 6.09%:  like this theory a lot but
  19745 6.09%:  think you just rewrote the science of all
  19746 6.09%:  think you just had a science org
  19747 6.09%:  need to talk to you after this!!
  19748 6.09%:  really need to look into that for
  19749 41.37%:  really need to look into that for science
  19750 36.66%:  really need to look into that for science because
  19751 13.06%:  really need to look into that for science!!
  19752 6.09%:  think you should let science
  19753 6.09%:  should write a book about this at
  19754 6.09%:  feel like that idea just got way
  19755 12.82%:  feel like that idea just got way too
  19756 6.09%:  think that could be really
  19757 7.38%:  think that could be really great
  19758 10.67%:  think that could be really great science
  19759 6.09%:  really think that could be our best answer to
  19760 6.09%:  need to get back to you on this one because i
  19761 6.09%:  need to figure out a way to be able to tell
  19762 6.09%:  need to write a book about these all
  19763 6.09%:  can barely breathe knowing this secret
  19764 6.09%:  would like this theory to be real!!
  19765 6.08%:  thought it was like
  19766 6.08%:  forgot about that one because then we could
  19767 6.08%:  need to write a book series about a
  19768 19.23%:  need to write a book series about a young
  19769 14.21%:  need to write a book series about a young teen
  19770 9.04%:  need to write a book series about a teen
  19771 6.08%:  could totally see that working for an
  19772 40.18%:  could totally see that working for an entire
  19773 6.08%:  need to write a book about being the only real
  19774 6.08%:  need to write a science blog about that before
  19775 7.06%:  need to write a science blog about that before you
  19776 6.08%:  think we just learned the secret about our
  19777 6.08%:  really need to talk to this genius
  19778 20.26%:  really need to talk to this genius about
  19779 6.08%:  think you just changed all our beliefs now!!
  19780 6.08%:  really need to figure out how to turn a science
  19781 6.08%:  think you need to get that on
  19782 6.08%:  think you just won the contest for c
  19783 6.08%:  would like this to be the story
  19784 6.08%:  thought it was because of
  19785 6.08%:  like this one better than your actual
  19786 6.08%:  think you just blew our entire case for
  19787 17.48%:  think you just blew our entire case for the
  19788 6.08%:  can totally see that working under
  19789 7.10%:  can totally see that working under the rules
  19790 6.08%:  need to figure out how to correct the
  19791 6.08%:  like that theory best because it would
  19792 6.08%:  really need to talk to science about their fr
  19793 6.08%:  should write about this before
  19794 35.08%:  should write about this before anyone
  19795 9.86%:  should write about this before you
  19796 6.08%:  need to go think about this fantasy
  19797 6.08%:  think we just turned science totally
  19798 6.07%:  really need to think about these giant bros for
  19799 6.07%:  really thought it would be easier to not be
  19800 6.07%:  feel like that should be way easier to turn
  19801 6.07%:  think you just won the science debate for 
  19802 6.07%:  need to think about this because all current
  19803 6.07%:  think that could finally be true
  19804 6.07%:  just learned about the science of light
  19805 6.07%:  like this theory and want to steal
  19806 6.07%:  really need to write about this for
  19807 6.07%:  would like that to be science
  19808 11.24%:  would like that to be science fact
  19809 6.07%:  think you just found a calling
  19810 6.07%:  should write a science book that totally
  19811 6.07%:  think we just figured out the secret cabal!!
  19812 6.07%:  need to tell this to ast
  19813 6.06%:  can totally get behind that so
  19814 6.06%:  thought it was because nobody
  19815 6.06%:  should totally write a book about current
  19816 57.70%:  should totally write a book about current science
  19817 6.06%:  already know enough about science for it to be truth
  19818 6.06%:  really need to learn about science first!!
  19819 6.06%:  need to go write that fan theory
  19820 6.06%:  think you just found a real thing!!
  19821 6.06%:  forgot about that until
  19822 15.06%:  forgot about that until now
  19823 12.58%:  forgot about that until now!!
  19824 6.06%:  think we just created a theory of science out
  19825 6.06%:  would like to see a science lecture about that for
  19826 6.06%:  think you just created the entire reason we
  19827 6.06%:  really need to think about this because once
  19828 6.06%:  really need to get back on science
  19829 6.06%:  need to think about this before we all lose
  19830 6.06%:  need to figure out a way to share these
  19831 6.06%:  feel like you just ruined the ghost
  19832 6.06%:  need to figure out how to breathe real
  19833 6.06%:  forgot to include that last one!!
  19834 6.06%:  think we should be careful not to let science get our
  19835 6.06%:  need to write a book about this because here
  19836 6.06%:  think we just found a reason to get really rich
  19837 6.06%:  need to figure out how to inject your
  19838 6.06%:  need to get out of here because it is now
  19839 6.06%:  just figured out how to connect all those
  19840 6.06%:  really need to know about that right
  19841 6.06%:  guess they could be real but their
  19842 6.06%:  thought you were nice for once!!
  19843 6.05%:  feel like science just went
  19844 13.32%:  feel like science just went through
  19845 25.37%:  feel like science just went through a door
  19846 6.05%:  really need to get out of this kitchen
  19847 6.05%:  need to write a story about these chick
  19848 6.05%:  think we just found out science!!
  19849 6.05%:  think you found the answer to our secret
  19850 6.05%:  feel like this could be a great theory to
  19851 6.05%:  need to figure out what that is as
  19852 6.05%:  guess that would finally account
  19853 6.05%:  thought you were cool but
  19854 6.05%:  just thought of a way to science
  19855 6.05%:  like how you started that
  19856 6.05%:  would like to be the one to say there are
  19857 6.05%:  need to know about this theory!!
  19858 6.05%:  need to think about this for a year just
  19859 6.05%:  would like that to be the case ten
  19860 6.05%:  need to go think about this now so
  19861 6.05%:  need to talk to a
  19862 6.05%:  really need to talk to these giants in
  19863 6.05%:  really need to figure out what colors
  19864 6.05%:  feel like you just ruined that last
  19865 6.05%:  need to start talking about science!!
  19866 6.05%:  think we found our science theory
  19867 6.05%:  feel like science just got better at
  19868 6.05%:  could totally write a science book just
  19869 26.73%:  could totally write a science book just about
  19870 6.05%:  should write that on a fortune
  19871 270.23%:  should write that on a fortune cookie because
  19872 109.47%:  should write that on a fortune cookie!!
  19873 15.12%:  should write that on a fortune cookie just
  19874 6.05%:  totally just learned about the science in
  19875 6.04%:  feel like you just threw that
  19876 10.39%:  feel like you just threw that out as
  19877 9.98%:  feel like you just threw that idea
  19878 10.50%:  feel like you just threw that idea at
  19879 8.97%:  feel like you just threw that idea out as
  19880 6.49%:  feel like you just threw that out as an
  19881 6.04%:  could totally see that working on the surface!!
  19882 6.04%:  need to think about that before you blow
  19883 6.04%:  feel like there should be a story written
  19884 6.04%:  think you just got the idea for a new career!!
  19885 6.04%:  just thought of a way to take
  19886 6.04%:  really need to look into the current
  19887 6.04%:  would like to see that article on
  19888 6.04%:  need to think about this for a sec to be
  19889 6.04%:  need to start talking to fewer
  19890 6.04%:  need to write a book about this before al
  19891 6.04%:  think we just figured out another role
  19892 6.04%:  really need to get back on the subject of what colour
  19893 6.04%:  like your ideas but
  19894 6.04%:  would like that theory to be correct if
  19895 6.04%:  think you just created another one
  19896 6.04%:  just thought of a new science book!!
  19897 6.04%:  would like this to be true enough to enjoy
  19898 6.04%:  need to think about that one for way less
  19899 6.03%:  like your ideas better than all of these
  19900 6.03%:  need to start science
  19901 7.08%:  need to start science blog
  19902 6.03%:  really need to write a book about these not
  19903 6.03%:  feel like this has been a
  19904 6.35%:  feel like this has been a great
  19905 6.03%:  already know about
  19906 6.54%:  already know about this
  19907 6.03%:  think you just created our best chance for not all
  19908 6.03%:  just thought of one way
  19909 6.03%:  just totally blew
  19910 6.03%:  need to get out of science sooner
  19911 15.92%:  need to get out of science sooner rather
  19912 6.03%:  really need to think about these sort
  19913 6.03%:  really need to get on that science shit real
  19914 6.03%:  guess that could be real but that
  19915 6.03%:  need to figure out a way to sell these
  19916 6.03%:  should totally write a book for science teacher
  19917 6.03%:  think this could be our last great front
  19918 6.03%:  thought you were a real science student!!
  19919 6.03%:  think we just found our story
  19920 6.03%:  need to get to the library to check for
  19921 6.03%:  really need to figure out how to talk this one
  19922 6.03%:  need to write a book about this because for the
  19923 6.03%:  forgot to check that last corner
  19924 6.03%:  should write a story about that feeling
  19925 6.03%:  need to tell you about this later because i
  19926 6.03%:  just thought of a better science idea!!
  19927 6.03%:  think we found the actual science
  19928 6.03%:  could totally see it being
  19929 13.53%:  could totally see it being that!!
  19930 9.03%:  could totally see it being that because
  19931 6.03%:  feel like science just got harder!!
  19932 6.03%:  just figured out how to be really cool!!
  19933 6.03%:  really think we just found out that science
  19934 6.03%:  feel like you just earned
  19935 6.02%:  would like to be the first to both
  19936 6.02%:  need to talk to this science guy who
  19937 6.02%:  need to get out of science soon
  19938 6.02%:  feel like that could be the answer to years
  19939 6.02%:  feel like you just hit the sweet
  19940 6.02%:  guess you could write that on the back of a bill!!
  19941 6.02%:  feel like we should be using the
  19942 6.02%:  would like to hear about your thesis
  19943 6.02%:  think you just wrote the first real good
  19944 6.02%:  think we just found the reason you get to be a
  19945 6.02%:  really should start eating better!!
  19946 6.02%:  really need to work on being able to react
  19947 15.14%:  really need to work on being able to react to this
  19948 6.25%:  really need to work on being able to react to such
  19949 6.02%:  think you figured out the answer to all cos
  19950 6.02%:  need to start saying that line before
  19951 6.02%:  think we should all just go
  19952 6.02%:  think we just found the real reason you ate
  19953 6.02%:  feel like this could be an answer to the age
  19954 6.02%:  need to figure out where the rest
  19955 6.02%:  think we just figured out the real reason l
  19956 6.02%:  would like that to be the case for science alone
  19957 6.02%:  need to write a book about all these boring
  19958 6.01%:  feel like you just said that out
  19959 6.01%:  think you just wrote the entire
  19960 6.01%:  need to tell this theory to science bro
  19961 6.01%:  feel like you just raised the bar on how
  19962 6.01%:  should write a book about the one true reality
  19963 6.01%:  think you just blew our entire chance for
  19964 6.01%:  like this theory a lot better because we can
  19965 6.01%:  thought only
  19966 6.01%:  could totally see that being shown
  19967 6.01%:  forgot to include that one theory
  19968 43.27%:  forgot to include that one theory because
  19969 6.01%:  need to talk to you later because nothing
  19970 18.01%:  need to talk to you later because nothing else
  19971 6.01%:  think we just found a better reason to call
  19972 6.01%:  really should know about this but
  19973 6.01%:  really need to write about this!!
  19974 6.01%:  would like that to be the case a lot of
  19975 6.01%:  need to write a book about science just
  19976 6.01%:  need to think about this one for real!!
  19977 6.01%:  need to go write a book about these alien
  19978 6.01%:  think we just found another case
  19979 6.01%:  really like that ending better now
  19980 6.01%:  need to get back to the future now
  19981 6.01%:  totally just figured out where to
  19982 6.01%:  need to think about this because at
  19983 6.01%:  cannot breathe because you just broke
  19984 9.60%:  cannot breathe because you just broke the
  19985 6.01%:  like this theory because we don
  19986 6.01%:  like that theory so
  19987 6.00%:  really need to get to work on science
  19988 6.00%:  feel like science just got blown out
  19989 6.00%:  feel like that should count as one
  19990 29.88%:  feel like that should count as one giant
  19991 6.00%:  already know enough about science to still be here
  19992 6.00%:  need to think about this before we can agree
  19993 6.00%:  think you just created a best
  19994 6.00%:  need to write that article before
  19995 52.57%:  need to write that article before anyone
  19996 11.06%:  need to write that article before you
  19997 6.00%:  really thought we talked
  19998 98.61%:  really thought we talked about science
  19999 178.65%:  really thought we talked about science before
  20000 26.53%:  really thought we talked about serious
  20001 16.85%:  really thought we talked about science before!!
  20002 11.99%:  really thought we talked about science in
  20003 11.58%:  really thought we talked about science once
  20004 10.28%:  really thought we talked about science once in
  20005 9.08%:  really thought we talked about science for
  20006 19.27%:  really thought we talked about science for once
  20007 8.63%:  really thought we talked about science on
  20008 7.69%:  really thought we talked about science for once!!
  20009 6.05%:  really thought we talked about science just
  20010 6.01%:  really thought we talked about science not
  20011 6.00%:  think you just said too
  20012 6.00%:  think we just learned about the true face
  20013 6.00%:  need to think about this a lot longer before a
  20014 6.00%:  forgot to include the whole
  20015 6.00%:  just thought of a way science could one
  20016 6.00%:  think we just had our first natural
  20017 6.00%:  really need to finish that book because
  20018 6.00%:  think you just turned a giant
  20019 6.00%:  need to go write that book!!
  20020 6.00%:  need to talk about this with a non
  20021 6.00%:  would like to note that you are not
  20022 5.99%:  should write a book about all the science for
  20023 5.99%:  would like to hear the
  20024 349.37%:  would like to hear the rest of your
  20025 158.90%:  would like to hear the rest of your insane

  20033 10.49%:  would like to hear the entire story
  20034 9.36%:  would like to hear the entire story about
  20035 5.99%:  cannot begin to tell you how that idea rocks

  20082 5.98%:  think you just found a great new career choice
  20083 5.98%:  think that could easily account for between
  20084 5.98%:  feel like that should count against you not
  20085 5.98%:  really thought it would be easier to reject
  20086 5.98%:  need to write a book series about your
  20087 5.98%:  could totally see that being on the science r

  20166 5.98%:  think you just got the coolest idea for a web
  20167 5.98%:  would like to see your science though
  20168 5.97%:  like your idea better than the one about our
  20169 5.97%:  forgot about that one second!!
  20170 5.97%:  really need to check out what
  20171 5.97%:  think you just won the best friend race!!
  20172 5.97%:  like this new theory because of all
  20173 5.97%:  think we just found your science career!!
  20174 5.97%:  thought you were a real nice friend!!
  20175 5.97%:  feel like this one should
  20176 5.97%:  can barely breathe right now but it feels
  20177 5.97%:  need to write a book on this before these
  20178 5.97%:  need to get back to the library because we
  20179 17.03%:  need to get back to the library because we just
  20180 5.97%:  think that could be a really fun
  20181 22.91%:  think that could be a really fun science
  20182 5.97%:  need to think about this before you turn
  20183 5.97%:  was just about to do that before
  20184 5.97%:  like this theory because we all
  20185 19.37%:  like this theory because we all get
  20186 12.82%:  like this theory because we all agree
  20187 5.97%:  think you found the real reason to
  20188 5.97%:  think you just rewrote the entire balance of global
  20189 5.97%:  should write a book about these clearly true
  20190 5.97%:  really need to think of a better insult because
  20191 5.97%:  think we just had science
  20192 5.97%:  would like this theory to be real because of
  20193 5.97%:  need to start wearing a shirt
  20194 5.96%:  think that just got
  20195 7.53%:  think that just got science
  20196 5.96%:  really need to check into that because if so
  20197 5.96%:  like your ideas better too
  20198 5.96%:  need to tell you about science later
  20199 5.96%:  think you just created the coolest alien race for
  20200 5.96%:  think we should all start buying
  20201 5.96%:  need to figure out how to sue
  20202 6.30%:  need to figure out how to sue this
  20203 5.96%:  really need to figure out how to talk science out
  20204 5.96%:  need to talk to ast
  20205 5.96%:  think you just created the entire new
  20206 5.96%:  feel like you just ruined the central
  20207 5.96%:  feel like the only reason we started
  20208 5.96%:  feel like the answer to that one is no
  20209 7.26%:  feel like the answer to that one is no but
  20210 5.96%:  really should write a book about the non
  20211 5.96%:  guess you could tell that
  20212 5.96%:  need to talk to you about the science news
  20213 5.96%:  need to write this book before anyone real
  20214 5.96%:  thought you were a real nice friend but
  20215 5.96%:  think you hit on
  20216 5.96%:  forgot to include the science
  20217 5.96%:  forgot about that theory because science wouldn
  20218 5.95%:  thought you were into science because
  20219 5.95%:  think you just found the secret giant
  20220 5.95%:  forgot to include that one because only
  20221 5.95%:  feel like there should be a cartoon about our
  20222 5.95%:  should write a book about this clearly better
  20223 5.95%:  was just about to go out and check for the
  20224 5.95%:  really need to check this out because now
  20225 5.95%:  totally just figured out how to lose
  20226 5.95%:  need to think about this one clearly for
  20227 5.95%:  gotta write that science book before you
  20228 5.95%:  like this theory better and cannot
  20229 5.95%:  just thought of a new reason to build an
  20230 88.91%:  just thought of a new reason to build an orbit
  20231 5.97%:  just thought of a new reason to build an orb
  20232 5.95%:  just learned about science in real
  20233 5.95%:  think you just got a little close
  20234 5.95%:  like that theory a
  20235 14.85%:  like that theory a little
  20236 14.01%:  like that theory a lot because
  20237 11.32%:  like that theory a lot!!
  20238 5.95%:  need to figure out how to learn about ast
  20239 5.95%:  need to write a book about these stellar flying
  20240 5.95%:  guess you could take that to heart
  20241 5.95%:  need to write a book about these al
  20242 35.10%:  need to write a book about these aliens!!
  20243 6.76%:  need to write a book about these aliens for
  20244 5.95%:  forgot to include that theory because our
  20245 5.95%:  would like to be the first one to laugh because
  20246 5.94%:  gotta write about this one
  20247 7.53%:  gotta write about this one day
  20248 5.94%:  feel like that idea just got stolen by
  20249 5.94%:  just thought of a science book title!!
  20250 5.94%:  feel like we should get on that because
  20251 5.94%:  think that could be our first real clue yet!!
  20252 5.94%:  just figured out how to connect these
  20253 5.94%:  need to think about all this real
  20254 5.94%:  really need to get on that science article!!
  20255 5.94%:  need to figure out whether
  20256 5.94%:  would like to be the first to hereby cert
  20257 5.94%:  need to think about that for really long!!
  20258 5.94%:  really should write a science book about the
  20259 5.94%:  need to figure out a better way to lose
  20260 5.94%:  need to figure out a way to be there
  20261 5.94%:  think you need to be careful about that line
  20262 5.94%:  guess it could
  20263 11.24%:  guess it could be true
  20264 7.04%:  guess it could be true!!
  20265 5.94%:  already know enough science to be the
  20266 11.66%:  already know enough science to be the best
  20267 11.99%:  already know enough science to be the best at
  20268 14.32%:  already know enough science to be the best at it!!
  20269 5.94%:  think we just learned about life!!
  20270 5.94%:  really think we just found out science
  20271 5.94%:  guess you could write that in a book that no
  20272 5.94%:  need to talk to you about it when
  20273 5.94%:  really should get back to science before the
  20274 5.93%:  need to think about that because you blew
  20275 5.93%:  really need to work on being able to shut
  20276 5.93%:  think we just learned about the only real
  20277 8.01%:  think we just learned about the only real secret
  20278 5.93%:  feel like you just turned on the lights on a
  20279 5.93%:  think you found the correct answer to a lot
  20280 5.93%:  think we just figured out the really cool reason to be
  20281 5.93%:  think we just figured out the real reason baby
  20282 5.93%:  would like to be the first to cancel
  20283 5.93%:  need to get to the library this
  20284 5.93%:  would like to be that guy
  20285 5.93%:  need to talk to you later but
  20286 5.93%:  need to figure out how to steal all your science!!
  20287 5.93%:  think we just turned into
  20288 5.93%:  think this could be our only
  20289 5.93%:  was totally right about the second
  20290 5.93%:  think you just turned giant
  20291 31.23%:  think you just turned giant bros real
  20292 14.27%:  think you just turned giant bros real!!
  20293 5.93%:  would totally check
  20294 84.05%:  would totally check that out!!
  20295 68.90%:  would totally check that out because
  20296 26.35%:  would totally check that out if
  20297 10.02%:  would totally check that out before
  20298 9.59%:  would totally check that out because if
  20299 7.18%:  would totally check that out for
  20300 11.73%:  would totally check that out for sure
  20301 9.12%:  would totally check that out for sure!!
  20302 5.93%:  need to get better
  20303 42.96%:  need to get better at science
  20304 10.54%:  need to get better at science!!
  20305 5.93%:  could totally see that working out because of
  20306 5.93%:  cannot breathe because you just threw
  20307 5.93%:  already know enough about science for it to be sc
  20308 5.93%:  feel like that should be an entire story
  20309 5.93%:  would like that to be true greatly
  20310 5.92%:  need to get to the library now!!
  20311 5.92%:  need to go write about this theory for

  20578 16.65%:  need to figure out how to correct all these
  20579 5.90%:  forgot to include that theory because like
  20580 5.90%:  really need to learn about the science!!
  20581 5.90%:  can totally see how this could be true about
  20582 5.90%:  need to get back to the library to search
  20583 5.90%:  could totally see that working in our
  20584 5.90%:  think you just altered the entire course of local

  20601 7.34%:  really like how this
  20602 5.90%:  feel like there are
  20603 5.90%:  need to talk to science about your
  20604 5.90%:  would like that to be the story
  20605 5.90%:  feel like science has
  20606 11.82%:  feel like science has already
  20607 5.90%:  feel like this theory could be true just
  20608 5.90%:  feel like that could be written
  20609 14.77%:  feel like that could be written on the
  20610 5.90%:  think you just got a science award for
  20611 5.90%:  think we need to start telling
  20612 5.89%:  feel like you just turned into a real

  20617 8.70%:  need to think about this because one of you
  20618 5.89%:  need to figure out what to call this because
  20619 5.89%:  would like to note that the reason
  20620 5.89%:  need to talk to you again soon
  20621 5.89%:  forgot to include that theory because unlike

  20643 5.89%:  really need to talk to these science bro
  20644 5.89%:  think you just rewrote the science balance

  20652 5.88%:  thought you were a fake
  20653 5.88%:  could totally see that being a science book for
  20654 5.88%:  really need to figure out science real
  20655 5.88%:  just thought of a new science book to buy
  20656 5.88%:  need to go think about that for serious
  20657 5.88%:  need to get out of your house with
  20658 5.88%:  need to think about this because clearly not

  20665 5.88%:  really need to write a book about science once
  20666 5.88%:  already know enough science to feel
  20667 5.88%:  need to think about this cause
  20668 5.88%:  really need to look into this before these

  20676 5.88%:  would like to see a theory of science brought
  20677 5.88%:  could totally get with
  20678 5.88%:  totally just learned about science though!!
  20679 5.88%:  feel like this could be true because that
  20680 5.87%:  need to think about this before we say
  20681 5.87%:  think we just had a real science
  20682 5.87%:  would like that to be true if only because a secret
  20683 5.87%:  should totally write a book about science here
  20684 5.87%:  need to get back to school before it

  20708 24.83%:  thought we could talk about real
  20709 60.38%:  thought we could talk about real science
  20710 95.60%:  thought we could talk about real science for
  20711 22.24%:  thought we could talk about it
  20712 20.60%:  thought we could talk about science
  20713 17.27%:  thought we could talk about science for
  20714 14.97%:  thought we could talk about real science for one
  20715 10.91%:  thought we could talk about science for a bit
  20716 8.14%:  thought we could talk about it before
  20717 6.67%:  thought we could talk about real science before
  20718 5.87%:  think you just bought
  20719 5.87%:  think you need to be serious about all
  20720 11.35%:  think you need to be serious about all that
  20721 13.47%:  think you need to be serious about all that before
  20722 5.87%:  forgot to check that one because you weren
  20723 5.86%:  really think we should go for
  20724 6.84%:  really think we should go for a
  20725 5.86%:  really thought we talked about science for one
  20726 5.86%:  was just about to credit the
  20727 5.86%:  like your idea better than the one we
  20728 5.86%:  feel like you just threw that one
  20729 6.57%:  feel like you just threw that one in
  20730 15.45%:  feel like you just threw that one in because
  20731 5.86%:  need to go write about that like
  20732 5.86%:  really think that could be it because
  20733 5.86%:  really like this one because
  20734 5.86%:  need to go think about this for real real now
  20735 5.86%:  think you should just write a fan
  20736 5.86%:  thought we could talk about real science first
  20737 5.86%:  need to think about this for a really long sec
  20738 5.86%:  really need to think about it later
  20739 5.86%:  need to go think about this now because our
  20740 5.86%:  thought you were outside
  20741 5.86%:  really like how this turned
  20742 6.32%:  really like how this turned out!!
  20743 5.86%:  could totally see that working because if
  20744 5.86%:  think we found the secret to beating
  20745 5.86%:  think you just blew both our brains!!
  20746 5.86%:  just totally figured out the whole science
  20747 5.86%:  really need to figure out how to learn science that
  20748 5.86%:  think we just found the secret!!
  20749 5.86%:  need to think about this clearly for
  20750 5.86%:  was totally just looking for that
  20751 5.86%:  think we found the real secret to being
  20752 5.85%:  guess that would account for the bill
  20753 5.85%:  need to go write about this before the
  20754 5.85%:  really need to talk to the science bros about being
  20755 5.85%:  would like to be the first to argue there
  20756 5.85%:  really need to work on that
  20757 10.10%:  really need to work on that science
  20758 5.85%:  like that theory better for
  20759 5.85%:  think you just found the one case
  20760 5.85%:  just thought of a way to earn
  20761 5.85%:  need to start working on the
  20762 25.64%:  need to start working on the theory
  20763 5.85%:  would like to see your science about
  20764 17.37%:  would like to see your science about that!!
  20765 13.92%:  would like to see your science about that one
  20766 8.89%:  would like to see your science about that before
  20767 5.85%:  feel like that theory just got closer
  20768 5.85%:  feel like this could be the reason you
  20769 5.85%:  would like to see the source for your
  20770 5.85%:  need to write a book about these anti
  20771 5.85%:  was totally just looking around
  20772 6.38%:  was totally just looking around for the
  20773 5.85%:  need to talk to you about the science fair
  20774 5.85%:  think we just got the
  20775 5.85%:  need to write about these guys before
  20776 5.85%:  need to write about that in a book before
  20777 5.85%:  need to write that science book sooner
  20778 5.85%:  think we need to tell the
  20779 50.55%:  think we need to tell the science
  20780 51.63%:  think we need to tell the science guys
  20781 48.96%:  think we need to tell the science guys about our
  20782 12.64%:  think we need to tell the science guys!!
  20783 5.85%:  think we figured out the actual
  20784 17.91%:  think we figured out the actual secret
  20785 17.65%:  think we figured out the actual reason
  20786 8.55%:  think we figured out the actual secrets
  20787 5.85%:  think this calls for a new debate!!
  20788 5.85%:  would like to be the last one to hear it
  20789 5.85%:  need to figure out what science has to
  20790 5.85%:  just thought of a new science book title and you
  20791 5.85%:  was just about to correct you on being fake
  20792 5.85%:  feel like you just changed the rules to beat
  20793 5.84%:  need to talk to you right now because this one
  20794 5.84%:  need to get back to the library as
  20795 5.84%:  totally should write a book about this fr
  20796 5.84%:  really need to think about things after
  20797 5.84%:  guess you could call that one another
  20798 5.84%:  think we just found a really great science lecture
  20799 5.84%:  need to write a story about these fool
  20800 5.84%:  need to think about that because if we
  20801 5.84%:  really need to write a book about science to get
  20802 5.84%:  think you figured out how to be secret
  20803 5.84%:  really need to think about this subject
  20804 5.84%:  think we just found the actual real science
  20805 5.84%:  need to figure out where those
  20806 5.84%:  think you need to be careful how
  20807 5.84%:  need to think about this too long
  20808 6.57%:  need to think about this too long because
  20809 5.84%:  already know enough about science to just feel
  20810 5.84%:  would like that theory to be science because
  20811 5.84%:  really need to figure out how to see that!!
  20812 5.84%:  think you just blew our chances for a
  20813 5.84%:  really should get out
  20814 5.84%:  already know enough about science to tell there
  20815 5.84%:  would like to see these gi
  20816 5.84%:  think you are right on
  20817 5.84%:  think we just need
  20818 5.84%:  need to go write a science book so that
  20819 5.83%:  think you just won the logic battle!!
  20820 5.83%:  can totally see how this could be our
  20821 9.87%:  can totally see how this could be our current
  20822 6.99%:  can totally see how this could be our entire
  20823 5.83%:  think we just figured out not only a
  20824 5.83%:  need to write a science book on that!!
  20825 5.83%:  need to figure out how to sell this!!
  20826 5.83%:  think you need to be careful about not
  20827 5.83%:  can totally see that being worth
  20828 5.83%:  just figured out why the
  20829 5.83%:  think you just blew our last chance at not
  20830 5.83%:  need to get back to you on this because if true
  20831 5.83%:  should write a book about this to tell
  20832 5.83%:  would like that to be the case because if you get
  20833 5.83%:  would totally check out
  20834 6.26%:  would totally check out a
  20835 5.83%:  would like that to be the last science
  20836 5.83%:  really need to start setting
  20837 5.83%:  really like that ending better than ours
  20838 5.83%:  think you just blew science out of the door!!
  20839 5.83%:  think you just won this debate for real real
  20840 5.83%:  just thought of a way to ruin dark
  20841 5.83%:  need to figure out a way to lose that
  20842 5.83%:  think you just found the reason we all get
  20843 5.83%:  feel like you just turned the lights on a
  20844 5.83%:  need to figure out a way to look better
  20845 5.83%:  need to write about this before you can
  20846 10.42%:  need to write about this before you can take
  20847 8.31%:  need to write about this before you can change
  20848 5.83%:  think we found our secret
  20849 5.83%:  just figured out what all the science talk
  20850 5.82%:  would like this theory to be factual because
  20851 5.82%:  think you need to tell the entire
  20852 5.82%:  think you just got us into a new
  20853 5.82%:  need to start talking to you before lunch
  20854 65.82%:  need to start talking to you before lunch because
  20855 16.83%:  need to start talking to you before lunch because we
  20856 5.82%:  can totally see how science
  20857 5.82%:  think you found the secret to eternal cool
  20858 5.82%:  would like to say that such an
  20859 5.82%:  would like to be the first to learn about our
  20860 5.82%:  need to write that essay about
  20861 5.82%:  thought you were a little
  20862 5.82%:  really need to write a book about these right
  20863 5.82%:  need to write a book about science clearly enough
  20864 5.82%:  think you just got the answer correct and
  20865 5.82%:  think you just changed real science too
  20866 5.82%:  would like to be the one to correct this
  20867 5.82%:  cannot breathe because of how likely it
  20868 5.82%:  think you just ruined all the sc
  20869 5.82%:  think you found the secret to eternal aw
  20870 5.82%:  can totally get behind this newest
  20871 5.82%:  really should know about science better before cutting
  20872 5.82%:  like this theory better because no longer do
  20873 5.82%:  should write a science book or
  20874 5.82%:  feel like that could be worth a
  20875 5.82%:  forgot about that until now because
  20876 7.22%:  forgot about that until now because science
  20877 5.82%:  need to write a book because clearly
  20878 5.82%:  think we just changed our science
  20879 5.82%:  could totally write a book for
  20880 5.82%:  really should write a book about such
  20881 5.81%:  could totally see it!!
  20882 5.81%:  think we just found the best real
  20883 5.81%:  think you just got an idea for how
  20884 5.81%:  really need to write a book about this so the
  20885 5.81%:  kinda want this to be real too!!
  20886 5.81%:  need to figure out a way to steal this joke
  20887 5.81%:  just thought of a way science could learn
  20888 5.81%:  really thought it would be easier to be a
  20889 5.81%:  think we need to figure out our
  20890 5.81%:  think we just found the secret to being cooler!!
  20891 5.81%:  need to talk to you right this
  20892 5.81%:  forgot to include that one because you were
  20893 5.81%:  guess it could be!!
  20894 5.81%:  feel like you just created another reason to go
  20895 5.81%:  need to talk about this because
  20896 5.81%:  feel like that would be a better theory on
  20897 5.81%:  like your idea better but then
  20898 5.81%:  need to write a book about all of these gi
  20899 5.81%:  really need to get back to the science soon!!
  20900 5.81%:  like this one better than your usual
  20901 5.81%:  think you just altered the course of an
  20902 5.81%:  could totally see that being in a horror
  20903 5.81%:  should write a book about giants you
  20904 5.81%:  think you just blew the brains
  20905 6.12%:  think you just blew the brains out of all
  20906 5.81%:  need to figure out a way to sell that in
  20907 5.80%:  thought you were into science just
  20908 5.80%:  like your ideas better before that one!!
  20909 5.80%:  need to get to the library before it closes o
  20910 5.80%:  think you need to call science about those
  20911 5.80%:  feel like you just ruined another great
  20912 5.80%:  was totally just looking for the
  20913 5.88%:  was totally just looking for the chance
  20914 5.80%:  would like to hear your science
  20915 8.17%:  would like to hear your science teacher
  20916 5.80%:  feel like that is the only reason to go
  20917 5.80%:  think you should write a note
  20918 21.31%:  think you should write a note about
  20919 5.80%:  need to get out of this country because how
  20920 5.80%:  should totally write about these gi

  20922 13.76%:  need to write a book about the only thing
  20923 7.50%:  need to write a book about the only science
  20924 5.80%:  need to write that science book!!
  20925 5.80%:  feel like you just ruined the one reason
  20926 5.80%:  need to go back to school because that blew
  20927 5.80%:  really need to check out the latest news
  20928 6.90%:  really need to check out the latest news in
  20929 5.80%:  need to sit
  20930 5.80%:  think you just altered the balance
  20931 35.10%:  think you just altered the balance of science
  20932 20.48%:  think you just altered the balance between
  20933 11.02%:  think you just altered the balance between our
  20934 5.80%:  could totally see that being the source for our
  20935 5.80%:  think you just got the idea correct!!
  20936 5.80%:  totally should write a book about being the
  20937 5.80%:  feel like that could be a great
  20938 11.39%:  feel like that could be a great theory
  20939 9.48%:  feel like that could be a great science
  20940 7.02%:  feel like that could be a great science story
  20941 5.93%:  feel like that could be a great story
  20942 5.80%:  think you just blew all their
  20943 5.80%:  need to go think about life now because there
  20944 5.79%:  think you just created a science where all of our
  20945 5.79%:  really think that would count
  20946 32.46%:  really think that would count as science
  20947 7.99%:  really think that would count as being
  20948 5.79%:  would like to be there for that one because
  20949 5.79%:  would like to be the first one to say then
  20950 5.79%:  feel like that idea just got way too close
  20951 5.79%:  already thought about it
  20952 5.79%:  really need to check this out for
  20953 5.79%:  really need to look into that now because there
  20954 5.79%:  need to figure out a way to check those
  20955 6.26%:  need to figure out a way to check those last
  20956 5.79%:  need to write a book about your life
  20957 5.79%:  really need to figure out the rules
  20958 5.79%:  like your ideas better before now!!
  20959 5.79%:  need to think about this for way longer bro
  20960 5.79%:  need to think about this alone for about
  20961 5.79%:  would like to note that if you
  20962 10.51%:  would like to note that if you are
  20963 54.74%:  would like to note that if you are correct
  20964 5.79%:  already know enough about science but if
  20965 18.03%:  already know enough about science but if there
  20966 5.79%:  just figured out how to talk to science
  20967 7.20%:  just figured out how to talk to science ner
  20968 5.79%:  guess that really
  20969 5.78%:  think you just blew our entire last chance at free
  20970 5.78%:  would like to be the first author on any
  20971 5.78%:  need to write a science book to tell you
  20972 5.78%:  need to talk to the other genius
  20973 5.78%:  can totally see that being one of the worlds
  20974 5.78%:  need to figure out how to be your science best
  20975 5.78%:  need to talk to you later about our beliefs!!
  20976 5.78%:  really should know about that before being so
  20977 5.78%:  think you just created the science for a
  20978 5.78%:  need to write a book on this before the rest
  20979 5.78%:  need to write a science book that teaches young
  20980 5.78%:  just figured out another reason to check
  20981 5.78%:  like your science better than the
  20982 19.25%:  like your science better than the actual
  20983 12.29%:  like your science better than the real
  20984 5.78%:  need to get on this before you steal it
  20985 5.78%:  think you just rewrote the entire god
  20986 5.78%:  really need to think things
  20987 5.78%:  need to talk to the science guy about his
  20988 5.78%:  would like that to be the case because for
  20989 27.02%:  would like that to be the case because for once it
  20990 14.44%:  would like that to be the case because for one
  20991 14.14%:  would like that to be the case because for one it
  20992 13.24%:  would like that to be the case because for once in
  20993 6.55%:  would like that to be the case because for once in our
  20994 5.78%:  think you figured out the real reason we sent all
  20995 5.78%:  need to write a story about this bro
  20996 5.78%:  need to go think about this for a reason
  20997 5.78%:  really need to check that out sooner because
  20998 5.78%:  totally just had an
  20999 7.61%:  totally just had an org
  21000 5.78%:  need to talk to you later because it is
  21001 5.78%:  cannot begin to tell you what these
  21002 6.14%:  cannot begin to tell you what these ideas
  21003 5.78%:  need to figure out how to access all
  21004 10.83%:  need to figure out how to access all that
  21005 9.39%:  need to figure out how to access all your
  21006 5.78%:  think you just won that debate because
  21007 5.78%:  can totally see that being the new
  21008 5.77%:  need to figure out how to absorb the
  21009 9.96%:  need to figure out how to absorb the entire
  21010 5.77%:  really need to figure out what else
  21011 5.77%:  would like to be the first to eat
  21012 5.77%:  can totally get on board with this fun
  21013 5.77%:  guess that would be okay
  21014 5.77%:  would like that to be your final
  21015 5.77%:  feel like this theory could turn
  21016 122.67%:  feel like this theory could turn out to be wrong
  21017 31.20%:  feel like this theory could turn out to be a
  21018 19.30%:  feel like this theory could turn out to be one
  21019 16.65%:  feel like this theory could turn out to be wrong!!
  21020 5.77%:  think you just altered the course of cel
  21021 5.77%:  thought you were a science real
  21022 57.58%:  thought you were a science realist!!

  21026 10.56%:  thought you were a science realist too!!
  21027 9.57%:  thought you were a science realist before but
  21028 5.77%:  need to go think about that one a
  21029 5.77%:  need to talk to you alone because right
  21030 24.74%:  need to talk to you alone because right now this
  21031 18.24%:  need to talk to you alone because right now there
  21032 9.13%:  need to talk to you alone because right now it
  21033 19.27%:  need to talk to you alone because right now it feels
  21034 9.10%:  need to talk to you alone because right now there is
  21035 5.77%:  really need to look into this one because w
  21036 5.77%:  need to write a story about giants for once!!
  21037 5.77%:  think you just found the real reason we gotta
  21038 5.77%:  totally just figured out where black
  21039 5.77%:  like that theory because of course
  21040 5.77%:  really think we just figured out a
  21041 5.76%:  need to call the science station
  21042 5.76%:  would like that to be true the
  21043 5.76%:  feel like you should be the one to gas
  21044 5.76%:  feel like that would be a better thesis
  21045 5.76%:  already know enough about science to feel bet
  21046 5.76%:  think you just ruined the best real
  21047 5.76%:  need to talk to you about regular
  21048 5.76%:  think we just found the secret to being our
  21049 5.76%:  think we just found the secret to being al
  21050 5.76%:  think we just totally changed science bro
  21051 5.76%:  feel like you just ruined the search
  21052 5.76%:  think you need to write these
  21053 5.76%:  think you just rewrote science to be
  21054 5.76%:  can totally get on board with this course
  21055 5.76%:  really need to check into that one because if so
  21056 5.76%:  would like that to be the case about 
  21057 5.76%:  was just about to correct the
  21058 5.76%:  just figured out the entire story
  21059 5.76%:  think you just found the correct answer to a big ol
  21060 5.76%:  cannot begin to tell you how sure
  21061 5.76%:  need to figure out a way to cash in on those
  21062 5.76%:  really should write a book about these bro
  21063 5.76%:  thought you were real science friends!!
  21064 5.76%:  thought you were a realist before
  21065 5.76%:  think you just altered the laws of our
  21066 27.19%:  think you just altered the laws of our entire
  21067 5.76%:  was totally looking into that before!!
  21068 5.76%:  think you figured out how to steal
  21069 15.83%:  think you figured out how to steal all
  21070 5.76%:  was just about to thank you for not being here
  21071 5.75%:  just learned about that like two hours before
  21072 5.75%:  think we should be careful not to let you
  21073 5.75%:  think we just figured the true
  21074 5.75%:  think we just created a theory about our
  21075 5.75%:  just thought of a radical new science to
  21076 5.75%:  really think we need to get science
  21077 5.75%:  was just about to try
  21078 5.75%:  feel like you just ruined a great secret
  21079 5.75%:  would like that to be the case for once because it
  21080 5.75%:  just thought of a way to talk science
  21081 5.75%:  forgot about that theory because we could
  21082 5.75%:  think we found our reason
  21083 5.75%:  think we just created science for
  21084 19.83%:  think we just created science for real
  21085 11.30%:  think we just created science for real!!
  21086 5.75%:  think that could be your first real
  21087 5.75%:  like this theory better about
  21088 5.75%:  think you found the secret to being a secret
  21089 5.75%:  was just talking about the one
  21090 5.75%:  need to go think about all these facts
  21091 5.75%:  could totally see that working on the science of
  21092 5.75%:  just figured out all science
  21093 5.75%:  really need to get into science faster!!
  21094 5.75%:  need to write an article about these so
  21095 5.75%:  would like to note that this only
  21096 5.75%:  need to think about this before we can really get
  21097 5.75%:  need to get on that science boat before you
  21098 5.75%:  think you just shot down all life
  21099 5.75%:  could totally see that working out on
  21100 5.75%:  need to think about this one slowly
  21101 5.75%:  need to get to the library to access
  21102 5.75%:  think we just found a great
  21103 33.51%:  think we just found a great science
  21104 10.06%:  think we just found a great science teacher
  21105 8.40%:  think we just found a great science teacher!!
  21106 5.93%:  think we just found a great reason
  21107 5.74%:  think you just created life!!
  21108 5.74%:  thought you were just a science
  21109 15.16%:  thought you were just a science bro
  21110 11.02%:  thought you were just a science friend
  21111 9.70%:  thought you were just a science bro before
  21112 7.14%:  thought you were just a science bro!!
  21113 6.53%:  thought you were just a science friend!!
  21114 5.74%:  would like that to be the actual science!!
  21115 5.74%:  need to write a story about these fell
  21116 5.74%:  think you just changed it
  21117 5.74%:  need to figure out how to shut
  21118 5.74%:  think you just learned science better
  21119 5.74%:  feel like science has been
  21120 5.74%:  was just about to conced
  21121 96.94%:  was just about to concede that flying
  21122 13.16%:  was just about to concede that you
  21123 11.36%:  was just about to concede that gi
  21124 8.94%:  was just about to concede the
  21125 19.18%:  was just about to concede the entire
  21126 7.36%:  was just about to concede your
  21127 7.05%:  was just about to concede the entire flying
  21128 6.52%:  was just about to concede your entire
  21129 6.21%:  was just about to concede that your
  21130 6.01%:  was just about to concede the flying
  21131 5.74%:  would like that to be the case because no one
  21132 5.74%:  think that would count as saying
  21133 5.74%:  think we just found out another
  21134 5.74%:  totally should write that book before
  21135 5.74%:  think you just rewrote the basic nature
  21136 5.74%:  thought you were just a friend to listen
  21137 5.74%:  like this theory for
  21138 5.74%:  need to think about this for longer to really be
  21139 5.74%:  think you just wasted
  21140 5.74%:  really like that because then we
  21141 5.74%:  should write a book about science clearly
  21142 5.74%:  would like to see your article about these
  21143 5.74%:  need to get to the science store now
  21144 5.74%:  forgot about that theory in
  21145 5.74%:  should totally write a book about these er
  21146 5.74%:  think we just found the central
  21147 5.74%:  think we just found the coolest actual
  21148 5.74%:  need to go write a science book about the
  21149 5.74%:  was just reading
  21150 8.02%:  was just reading about the
  21151 11.49%:  was just reading about the theory
  21152 5.74%:  think you just single
  21153 5.74%:  need to write a science story that
  21154 5.74%:  need to get back to you on that because while
  21155 5.74%:  need to write this book real
  21156 12.50%:  need to write this book real fast
  21157 6.04%:  need to write this book real fast!!
  21158 5.74%:  need to get back to you about whether
  21159 5.73%:  think you need to be careful because those
  21160 5.73%:  need to write a fan
  21161 5.73%:  guess that would totally be the
  21162 5.73%:  can totally see how that could be true for once!!
  21163 5.73%:  would like to see the science on that after
  21164 5.73%:  thought it was just a fancy
  21165 5.73%:  really need to get on that article!!
  21166 5.73%:  cannot breathe right now because i just fell
  21167 5.73%:  already know enough about science before the
  21168 5.73%:  think you just altered the entire global
  21169 5.73%:  already know enough about this science bull
  21170 5.73%:  think you just blew science out the roof!!
  21171 5.73%:  just figured out how to science
  21172 10.89%:  just figured out how to science the
  21173 5.73%:  think you just wrote the best alien
  21174 5.73%:  think we just found a better reason to be here!!
  21175 5.73%:  cannot breathe right now because of your c
  21176 5.73%:  gotta write about this one day!!
  21177 5.73%:  think you better tell the world because if
  21178 5.73%:  thought you were all about science and not sc
  21179 5.73%:  feel like this theory just wrote
  21180 5.73%:  guess that could totally be how
  21181 5.73%:  would like to see a source
  21182 68.15%:  would like to see a source on that before
  21183 67.85%:  would like to see a source on that theory
  21184 25.48%:  would like to see a source on that!!
  21185 17.39%:  would like to see a source on that right
  21186 23.08%:  would like to see a source on that right about
  21187 12.90%:  would like to see a source on that theory!!
  21188 11.14%:  would like to see a source on that one
  21189 6.11%:  would like to see a source on that that
  21190 5.84%:  would like to see a source for
  21191 259.97%:  would like to see a source for that theory
  21192 52.48%:  would like to see a source for that theory!!
  21193 23.76%:  would like to see a source for that right
  21194 22.52%:  would like to see a source for that theory but
  21195 13.76%:  would like to see a source for that one
  21196 12.33%:  would like to see a source for that!!
  21197 11.75%:  would like to see a source for that theory being
  21198 10.94%:  would like to see a source for that right about
  21199 5.73%:  really think we need to figure out these
  21200 5.73%:  feel like you just ruined a secret that the
  21201 5.73%:  need to think about this because now you are
  21202 5.73%:  forgot to include that because they
  21203 5.73%:  just thought of a reason to not
  21204 5.73%:  would like to hear about this story at
  21205 5.73%:  just had a science
  21206 5.82%:  just had a science break
  21207 5.72%:  need to get back to school because there
  21208 5.72%:  would like to hear about the science you
  21209 5.72%:  feel like that should be an easier one
  21210 5.72%:  need to write a story about this r
  21211 5.72%:  would like to be the first to reject any
  21212 13.78%:  would like to be the first to reject any such
  21213 5.72%:  need to talk to this guy about where
  21214 5.72%:  like this one better because you
  21215 5.72%:  think we just found the coolest one
  21216 5.72%:  can totally see that being turned
  21217 5.72%:  really need to write a book because it
  21218 13.24%:  really need to write a book because it turns
  21219 5.72%:  think you just brought down all science to
  21220 5.72%:  cannot begin to tell you how credible those are
  21221 5.72%:  think you just created a new race
  21222 58.71%:  think you just created a new race of beings
  21223 33.30%:  think you just created a new race of beings!!
  21224 9.26%:  think you just created a new race of gi
  21225 5.72%:  wonder
  21226 13.51%:  wonder if there
  21227 9.06%:  wonder if they
  21228 6.79%:  wonder if that
  21229 5.72%:  cannot think of a better way to close our disc
  21230 5.72%:  need to write a book for this theory!!
  21231 5.72%:  really need to get on the science of
  21232 12.89%:  really need to get on the science of this
  21233 7.49%:  really need to get on the science of that
  21234 5.72%:  think you and
  21235 5.72%:  just figured out the reason we think
  21236 5.72%:  would like to see that theory f
  21237 5.72%:  can totally see that being cred
  21238 13.29%:  can totally see that being credible now
  21239 9.11%:  can totally see that being credible now!!
  21240 5.72%:  need to go back to the library because this new
  21241 5.72%:  should write a book about the nature
  21242 20.63%:  should write a book about the nature of science
  21243 6.77%:  should write a book about the nature of science!!
  21244 5.72%:  would like to see a theory of that
  21245 6.22%:  would like to see a theory of that nature
  21246 5.72%:  feel like you just wrote the entire
  21247 5.72%:  think you just created one of the best urban
  21248 5.72%:  need to think about that before agree
  21249 5.72%:  kinda want this to be true enough
  21250 11.35%:  kinda want this to be true enough to be
  21251 11.72%:  kinda want this to be true enough to be real
  21252 6.69%:  kinda want this to be true enough to be really
  21253 5.72%:  forgot to include that because there are no
  21254 5.72%:  just figured out another reason that we
  21255 5.72%:  would like to see that thing
  21256 5.72%:  would like to hear this story about
  21257 5.72%:  feel like that would count as being correct
  21258 11.69%:  feel like that would count as being correct about
  21259 5.72%:  think you just created the coolest new genre
  21260 5.71%:  need to talk to you about science in about
  21261 5.71%:  think you just won the science lecture for
  21262 5.71%:  think you just found the real answer to big
  21263 5.71%:  would like to hear about that science story
  21264 5.71%:  think you figured out the real reason we collect
  21265 5.71%:  thought you were into science before and
  21266 5.71%:  really should write a book for
  21267 5.71%:  need to write an article on the subject!!
  21268 5.71%:  think you just got close
  21269 21.93%:  think you just got close to the
  21270 14.91%:  think you just got close to the real
  21271 5.71%:  need to figure out a way to be that
  21272 5.71%:  need to write a book on that subject because
  21273 5.71%:  need to write a book about all of this just
  21274 5.71%:  need to talk to this theory alone in
  21275 5.71%:  like that theory and it
  21276 5.71%:  would like to see your article about that before
  21277 5.70%:  would like to hear about that!!
  21278 5.70%:  would be really
  21279 12.80%:  would be really into
  21280 72.59%:  would be really into that!!
  21281 23.16%:  would be really into that being
  21282 189.30%:  would be really into that being true because
  21283 583.82%:  would be really into that being true because then
  21284 85.84%:  would be really into that being true!!
  21285 75.51%:  would be really into that being the
  21286 530.11%:  would be really into that being the case!!
  21287 64.96%:  would be really into that being the reason
  21288 54.53%:  would be really into that being the reason for
  21289 40.40%:  would be really into that being the correct
  21290 31.72%:  would be really into that being correct
  21291 27.49%:  would be really into that being true because of
  21292 25.39%:  would be really into that being true because of the
  21293 19.49%:  would be really into that because
  21294 37.81%:  would be really into that because then
  21295 59.13%:  would be really into that because then science
  21296 28.99%:  would be really into that because science
  21297 17.93%:  would be really into this
  21298 17.00%:  would be really into that because it
  21299 16.37%:  would be really into that being the secret
  21300 22.55%:  would be really into that being the secret reason
  21301 15.91%:  would be really into that being the case just
  21302 15.65%:  would be really into that because it turns
  21303 14.56%:  would be really into that being the case for
  21304 16.57%:  would be really into that being the case for sure
  21305 13.81%:  would be really into that being the case for sure!!
  21306 12.83%:  would be really into that being correct because
  21307 35.95%:  would be really into that being correct because then
  21308 12.66%:  would be really into that being correct!!
  21309 11.65%:  would be really into that being the secret of our
  21310 11.12%:  would be really into that being the true
  21311 22.14%:  would be really into that being the true reason
  21312 10.22%:  would be really into that being the case but
  21313 9.24%:  would be really into that being true but
  21314 8.21%:  would be really into that being the case for once
  21315 7.74%:  would be really into that if
  21316 13.16%:  would be really into that if that
  21317 7.63%:  would be really into that being the case just for
  21318 6.89%:  would be really into that being the future
  21319 6.88%:  would be really into that being true about
  21320 6.47%:  would be really into that because then it
  21321 6.29%:  would be really into that being true for
  21322 6.03%:  would be really into that because there
  21323 5.86%:  would be really into this because
  21324 10.13%:  would be really into this because then
  21325 5.85%:  would be really into that being true because the
  21326 5.74%:  would be really into this!!
  21327 5.70%:  need to figure out how to sue science
  21328 5.70%:  think that idea just got really
  21329 5.70%:  feel like that theory is just too
  21330 6.47%:  feel like that theory is just too good
  21331 5.70%:  need to talk to you about this before we ruin all
  21332 5.70%:  think you need to see
  21333 5.70%:  really need to write about this soon before
  21334 5.70%:  thought you were cute and
  21335 5.70%:  forgot to check that one because none
  21336 5.70%:  guess that really would
  21337 5.70%:  really need to think about this because before
  21338 5.70%:  should totally write a book about f
  21339 5.70%:  just figured out the best
  21340 27.68%:  just figured out the best theory
  21341 5.70%:  think you just found the secret to being a cooler
  21342 5.70%:  totally just figured out how to be an alien
  21343 5.70%:  think you need to get that science
  21344 5.70%:  just thought of a new science to do
  21345 5.70%:  need to figure out how to lose the
  21346 5.70%:  really need to start working out!!
  21347 5.70%:  would like that to be right
  21348 9.78%:  would like that to be right because
  21349 5.70%:  would like to see a theory about that science
  21350 5.70%:  would like to see that theory get a
  21351 6.58%:  would like to see that theory get a science
  21352 5.70%:  need to figure out what science books to
  21353 18.74%:  need to figure out what science books to burn
  21354 6.92%:  need to figure out what science books to burn real
  21355 5.70%:  really need to figure out how to take this course
  21356 5.70%:  need to go think about this because you are now
  21357 5.70%:  just figured out another way to be the cool
  21358 5.70%:  think we just changed reality for
  21359 16.04%:  think we just changed reality for real
  21360 5.70%:  feel like this theory could be wrong too!!
  21361 5.70%:  really need to get on that science stick
  21362 5.70%:  feel like that just
  21363 25.61%:  feel like that just changed
  21364 19.20%:  feel like that just changed reality
  21365 15.99%:  feel like that just changed science
  21366 9.45%:  feel like that just ruined
  21367 18.42%:  feel like that just ruined the
  21368 7.56%:  feel like that just ruined the beauty
  21369 6.95%:  feel like that just got
  21370 5.70%:  think you just got the last word for
  21371 5.70%:  would like to hear about this later but for
  21372 5.69%:  would like to be the first one to not rule
  21373 5.69%:  think we just found a hole
  21374 10.80%:  think we just found a hole in our
  21375 10.60%:  think we just found a hole in your
  21376 5.69%:  just heard
  21377 5.69%:  wonder if anyone
  21378 7.91%:  wonder if anyone else
  21379 39.92%:  wonder if anyone else thought
  21380 21.68%:  wonder if anyone else thought about
  21381 5.69%:  really need to write a book on
  21382 633.17%:  really need to write a book on this subject

  21495 5.68%:  thought you wanted to see
  21496 5.68%:  could totally see this being a future
  21497 5.68%:  would like to see this theory before
  21498 5.68%:  need to think about this one so
  21499 5.68%:  think we should totally agree to
  21500 5.68%:  just thought of an answer to all

  21510 5.67%:  need to talk to this theory real
  21511 5.67%:  could totally write that as
  21512 5.67%:  already know enough about this subject to be conf
  21513 5.67%:  forgot about that one because who
  21514 5.67%:  need to go write a science book because all
  21515 5.67%:  was just about to forget dark
  21516 5.67%:  really need to think about being better
  21517 5.67%:  totally just figured out the one

  21525 50.29%:  think we found our best theory
  21526 12.81%:  think we found our best theory since
  21527 11.36%:  think we found our best theory about
  21528 7.35%:  think we found our best science
  21529 23.70%:  think we found our best science theory
  21530 13.99%:  think we found our best science teacher
  21531 10.37%:  think we found our best science teacher!!
  21532 6.34%:  think we found our best theory about science
  21533 5.67%:  cannot begin to tell you how correct these
  21534 8.25%:  cannot begin to tell you how correct these ideas
  21535 93.95%:  cannot begin to tell you how correct these ideas are!!

  21537 63.83%:  think we just found the secret to curing all
  21538 5.67%:  like that theory because it creates
  21539 5.67%:  feel like this could be the answer!!
  21540 5.67%:  feel like that could be the correct answer guys!!
  21541 5.67%:  just had a theory
  21542 10.58%:  just had a theory about
  21543 5.66%:  would like that to be true but science has
  21544 5.66%:  think we just figured out that only
  21545 5.66%:  think we just found a reason to get a
  21546 5.66%:  think he
  21547 35.20%:  think he just blew
  21548 24.95%:  think he just blew your

  21588 5.66%:  need to go write a book about these fancy
  21589 5.66%:  think we found out science
  21590 5.66%:  think you just wasted the
  21591 18.69%:  think you just wasted the entire
  21592 5.66%:  think you should go first

  21594 5.66%:  think you should be careful not to answer
  21595 5.66%:  thought you were an at
  21596 5.66%:  need to figure out how to turn all those
  21597 13.48%:  need to figure out how to turn all those science
  21598 5.66%:  would like to see your first
  21599 5.66%:  feel like you just threw that idea out on
  21600 5.66%:  could totally see that being on nature
  21601 5.66%:  think you just blew our last chance for a good
  21602 5.66%:  could totally see that being on the science web
  21603 5.66%:  think you just created a whole science for
  21604 5.66%:  feel like we should be turning
  21605 9.89%:  feel like we should be turning that
  21606 5.66%:  would like this to be true for
  21607 11.45%:  would like this to be true for the
  21608 39.19%:  would like this to be true for the rest
  21609 11.49%:  would like this to be true for the sole
  21610 6.75%:  would like this to be true for the reason
  21611 5.66%:  need to figure out a way to cash this
  21612 5.66%:  really should write a book for this
  21613 5.66%:  was just about to thank you for being cred
  21614 7.68%:  was just about to thank you for being credible
  21615 5.65%:  would say that is a better
  21616 5.65%:  need to think about all the reasons we
  21617 5.65%:  really should be writing that book sooner!!
  21618 5.65%:  would like to see that story in
  21619 5.65%:  really need to think about this before we can get
  21620 5.65%:  need to tell you about these
  21621 10.70%:  need to tell you about these things
  21622 10.16%:  need to tell you about these things before
  21623 5.65%:  like where your brain has been!!
  21624 5.65%:  need to get on this theory train because
  21625 5.65%:  forgot about that because when
  21626 13.73%:  forgot about that because when you
  21627 5.65%:  really need to figure out how to talk so there
  21628 5.65%:  feel like the answer is no but there
  21629 5.65%:  need to think about this for one sec!!
  21630 5.65%:  would like that to be the case if only to ensure our
  21631 5.65%:  think you just altered the course of real
  21632 5.65%:  think you just found the answer to a tr
  21633 5.65%:  need to write that into a book so
  21634 5.65%:  need to get back to school before they call
  21635 5.65%:  can totally get behind this so
  21636 5.65%:  think you should get out of science!!
  21637 5.65%:  can totally see where that could be true if
  21638 5.65%:  need to go think about that for a serious
  21639 5.65%:  need to talk to you about solar
  21640 5.64%:  think you just won this battle round!!
  21641 5.64%:  already know enough about science to be sure if
  21642 5.64%:  feel like you just caught
  21643 5.64%:  need to talk to you about science babies
  21644 5.64%:  guess you could write that in a letter!!
  21645 5.64%:  totally just learned about it
  21646 5.64%:  need to write a book about this before he ru
  21647 5.64%:  think we found out about science last
  21648 5.64%:  need to write that book before another
  21649 7.90%:  need to write that book before another genius
  21650 5.64%:  think you just blew science out of all the or
  21651 5.64%:  just learned about that theory like four
  21652 5.64%:  always thought it could be alien
  21653 5.64%:  would like to see a source on that theory real
  21654 5.64%:  feel like that should be its own country
  21655 5.64%:  like that theory a lot because it doesn
  21656 5.64%:  think that could be your new best
  21657 8.47%:  think that could be your new best selling
  21658 5.64%:  think you just won the science bro debate!!
  21659 5.64%:  think you should get a science career
  21660 5.64%:  really need to watch science
  21661 5.64%:  think you just changed all science fore
  21662 5.64%:  think that could easily be wrong
  21663 5.64%:  can totally see how that could be true for non
  21664 5.64%:  would like that to be true if only because the non
  21665 5.64%:  just had the coolest feeling
  21666 5.63%:  forgot to include that one because it allows
  21667 5.63%:  think you just turned science fr
  21668 5.63%:  like where your brain has gone and
  21669 5.63%:  think that could be our answer for
  21670 5.63%:  feel like that one should be written on
  21671 5.63%:  need to get to the library before it closes who can
  21672 5.63%:  just figured out what all the science bo
  21673 5.63%:  feel like the answer to the
  21674 5.91%:  feel like the answer to the giant
  21675 5.63%:  kinda want this to be true just for your
  21676 5.63%:  just thought of a new career idea
  21677 5.63%:  need to think about this for a lot longer because y
  21678 5.63%:  cannot think of a better world
  21679 5.63%:  need to figure out how to obtain
  21680 5.63%:  think you just won the science club debate for
  21681 5.63%:  think you just found a real science that
  21682 5.63%:  guess you could write that in a book for all the
  21683 5.63%:  think we found it
  21684 5.63%:  feel like we should get on that one
  21685 5.63%:  think we found the secret to losing
  21686 5.63%:  think you just got the coolest award
  21687 10.73%:  think you just got the coolest award for
  21688 5.63%:  thought you were fake bros too but
  21689 5.62%:  think you need to be careful about the secrets
  21690 5.62%:  would like to see that on a screen
  21691 5.95%:  would like to see that on a screen right
  21692 5.62%:  would be really into that science
  21693 5.62%:  need to go back to the library because either
  21694 5.62%:  really need to get back on the subject of real
  21695 5.62%:  would like to see that on a science fact
  21696 5.62%:  like this new theory and also
  21697 5.62%:  was totally right there!!
  21698 5.62%:  need to get on this science boat before
  21699 5.62%:  thought about it for a second but no way
  21700 5.62%:  need to talk to you about falling
  21701 5.62%:  would like that to be true for real
  21702 6.13%:  would like that to be true for real because
  21703 11.85%:  would like that to be true for real because then
  21704 5.62%:  think we should start a club for giant
  21705 5.62%:  just learned about this
  21706 28.37%:  just learned about this theory
  21707 21.17%:  just learned about this theory like
  21708 32.83%:  just learned about this theory like two
  21709 19.65%:  just learned about this theory like ten
  21710 15.33%:  just learned about this theory about
  21711 8.22%:  just learned about this theory two
  21712 8.18%:  just learned about this theory for
  21713 7.66%:  just learned about this theory like a
  21714 6.30%:  just learned about this theory like an
  21715 5.62%:  think you just created a reason to go
  21716 16.76%:  think you just created a reason to go into
  21717 5.62%:  need to get out of here because this talk
  21718 5.62%:  would like this theory to be real just
  21719 5.62%:  feel like there should be a way to be
  21720 5.62%:  think you need to be careful about being
  21721 7.16%:  think you need to be careful about being that
  21722 5.62%:  guess that would be real
  21723 5.62%:  need to figure out how to take out
  21724 5.62%:  need to write about this for sure
  21725 5.62%:  think you just altered the nature of being
  21726 5.62%:  need to write a book about these great
  21727 5.62%:  would like to note that the only
  21728 5.62%:  could totally see that being our best chance of

  21916 5.59%:  think you just wrote that science
  21917 14.50%:  think you just wrote that science fan
  21918 5.59%:  forgot about that theory once

  21930 5.59%:  feel like this theory could be just
  21931 5.59%:  know nothing about these
  21932 5.59%:  feel like we just got closer to detect
  21933 5.59%:  really need to learn science facts
  21934 5.59%:  need to figure out how to track this
  21935 5.59%:  need to talk to you alone right now because it feels
  21936 5.58%:  would like to be the first one to set
  21937 5.58%:  need to write a book about this because y

  21939 5.58%:  need to get on this as
  21940 5.58%:  feel like you just stole the idea out
  21941 5.58%:  need to write a book before this guy ste

  21956 5.58%:  need to figure out what that joke
  21957 5.58%:  just got ch
  21958 5.58%:  really need to talk to science about this when
  21959 5.58%:  need to get back to the lab!!
  21960 5.58%:  think we found the actual secret reason
  21961 5.58%:  need to write a book about these illegal

  21963 39.98%:  need to call the news about this one

  22021 6.03%:  need to tell science this
  22022 15.15%:  need to tell science this theory
  22023 5.85%:  need to tell science that because
  22024 5.69%:  need to tell science about these giant bro
  22025 5.58%:  would like this to be true better
  22026 5.58%:  thought you were all science and no
  22027 5.58%:  think we just learned about the real science!!
  22028 5.57%:  think you should get a job as a writer of
  22029 5.57%:  think you need to write a letter
  22030 5.57%:  need to talk to you alone for just
  22031 13.94%:  need to talk to you alone for just a sec

  22037 8.50%:  think we need to tell science about our theory of
  22038 5.57%:  would like that to be true enough to feel
  22039 5.57%:  guess you could write a book on it
  22040 5.57%:  think you just created an entire other
  22041 5.57%:  think we just learned about science you
  22042 5.57%:  need to write that book before it occurs
  22043 5.57%:  feel like this should be an
  22044 5.57%:  really think we need to get this out
  22045 5.57%:  already know enough about the science to rule
  22046 5.57%:  feel like that theory would be easier to just
  22047 5.57%:  need to get back into science after all!!
  22048 5.57%:  should write a book about these big
  22049 5.57%:  think you just won the science debate race
  22050 5.57%:  need to write a book about nothing
  22051 16.88%:  need to write a book about nothing but
  22052 12.64%:  need to write a book about nothing because
  22053 5.57%:  would like to be the last one on
  22054 9.24%:  would like to be the last one on this

  22058 6.51%:  would like to be the last one on earth to be
  22059 5.57%:  think you just created the coolest alien race of our
  22060 5.57%:  need to think about this for way longer cause
  22061 5.57%:  really need to think about how to argue
  22062 5.57%:  really need to learn about science without
  22063 5.75%:  really need to learn about science without the
  22064 5.57%:  really need to look into this strange
  22065 5.57%:  think we just found out the real reason to call
  22066 5.57%:  guess that could be true for like
  22067 5.57%:  need to go think about this now because after
  22068 5.57%:  think you just rewrote science to be about
  22069 5.57%:  can totally see how this could be true after being
  22070 5.57%:  guess they could be real but there
  22071 5.57%:  need to go think about this for sure

  22413 5.52%:  was totally just gonna be
  22414 16.71%:  was totally just gonna be like
  22415 5.52%:  think that could be our first entry
  22416 5.52%:  can totally see where that could go in
  22417 5.51%:  really should write about
  22418 20.81%:  really should write about these
  22419 15.44%:  really should write about this before
  22420 10.84%:  really should write about science
  22421 10.16%:  really should write about this one
  22422 8.67%:  really should write about this on
  22423 5.80%:  really should write about that
  22424 5.51%:  feel like the only answer to that is an
  22425 5.51%:  need to think about this one just
  22426 5.51%:  need to get out of this reality!!
  22427 5.51%:  need to call the news about these
  22428 5.54%:  need to call the news about these flying
  22429 5.51%:  think you just stole that idea!!
  22430 5.51%:  really need to talk to that science
  22431 5.51%:  really need to work on being able to shut this
  22432 5.51%:  need to go back to the library to see
  22433 16.99%:  need to go back to the library to see if there
  22434 12.84%:  need to go back to the library to see what
  22435 6.26%:  need to go back to the library to see if there was
  22436 5.66%:  need to go back to the library to see what science
  22437 5.51%:  would like to see your science for
  22438 38.39%:  would like to see your science for that one
  22439 18.79%:  would like to see your science for that one!!
  22440 15.69%:  would like to see your science for that!!
  22441 5.51%:  forgot to check that website
  22442 12.12%:  forgot to check that website because
  22443 5.51%:  need to talk to you about being serious later
  22444 5.51%:  think we just figured out the secret early
  22445 5.51%:  feel like that was the only
  22446 17.46%:  feel like that was the only reason
  22447 8.05%:  feel like that was the only reason to
  22448 8.95%:  feel like that was the only reason to bring
  22449 6.00%:  feel like that was the only correct
  22450 15.40%:  feel like that was the only correct ending
  22451 11.56%:  feel like that was the only correct ending to our
  22452 5.51%:  need to write a book about this because o
  22453 5.51%:  think this could totally be true because we
  22454 5.52%:  think this could totally be true because we can
  22455 5.51%:  already know enough about science to be true
  22456 5.51%:  really need to learn about the science this
  22457 5.51%:  think you just found the answer to at
  22458 5.51%:  need to think about this one later because we
  22459 5.51%:  guess that could be one theory for
  22460 5.51%:  need to think about this for way longer a
  22461 5.51%:  need to go think about the rest
  22462 5.51%:  really need to get to the front
  22463 5.51%:  feel like that would be the best reason to go on a
  22464 5.51%:  really should write a book about it before
  22465 5.51%:  feel like you just got the last word in but
  22466 5.51%:  need to get back to this later because holy fr
  22467 5.51%:  really need to figure out how to clear this
  22468 5.51%:  think you just ruined one of the coolest career
  22469 5.51%:  think you just won the debate after
  22470 5.51%:  need to write a book about all this before there
  22471 5.51%:  would like to be the first one to hug you
  22472 5.50%:  should totally write that in a book of
  22473 5.50%:  need to write a story about such
  22474 6.86%:  need to write a story about such giant
  22475 5.50%:  feel like you just changed the rules at
  22476 5.50%:  really need to figure out how to be a science author
  22477 5.50%:  feel like you just brought science to the br
  22478 5.50%:  need to figure out how to learn about science all the
  22479 5.50%:  think you just found a lo
  22480 5.50%:  really should know about this before being a
  22481 5.50%:  think you found the secret to a career
  22482 5.50%:  think the answer could
  22483 7.08%:  think the answer could be yes!!
  22484 5.50%:  should totally write a book of this!!
  22485 5.50%:  think you just changed science real
  22486 5.50%:  feel like science just got a lot
  22487 15.05%:  feel like science just got a lot better
  22488 8.57%:  feel like science just got a lot better and
  22489 6.41%:  feel like science just got a lot better!!
  22490 5.50%:  think the answer is a
  22491 5.50%:  really need to write that book fast
  22492 5.50%:  need to figure out how to not say
  22493 5.50%:  totally just figured out where there
  22494 5.50%:  need to figure out how to teach science to al
  22495 5.50%:  thought you were all fake too because
  22496 5.50%:  need to see
  22497 15.67%:  need to see this
  22498 33.98%:  need to see this theory
  22499 33.17%:  need to see this theory written
  22500 18.59%:  need to see this theory in
  22501 10.57%:  need to see this theory before
  22502 8.67%:  need to see this with
  22503 6.99%:  need to see this right
  22504 42.72%:  need to see this right now!!
  22505 18.37%:  need to see this right away
  22506 5.50%:  really need to figure out how to lose this bet
  22507 5.50%:  already know enough about science to burst the
  22508 5.50%:  feel like that should be an easier counter
  22509 5.50%:  need to get to the library before all this
  22510 5.49%:  could totally see that being our best chance for
  22511 5.49%:  really think we should get a
  22512 5.49%:  just learned about this theory like four
  22513 5.49%:  was totally gonna end there!!
  22514 5.49%:  need to go back to the library before it
  22515 265.15%:  need to go back to the library before it closes!!
  22516 15.06%:  need to go back to the library before it closes at
  22517 5.49%:  should write a book on this one
  22518 5.49%:  need to talk about this right now only
  22519 8.83%:  need to talk about this right now only because
  22520 5.49%:  need to write a book about these genius theory
  22521 5.49%:  cannot breathe right now because it could be so
  22522 5.49%:  need to think about that one for a wi
  22523 5.49%:  cannot breathe right now due to all
  22524 5.49%:  would like to see that on a science teacher
  22525 5.49%:  need to go back to the library before the sun
  22526 5.49%:  would like to be the first guy to not be able
  22527 5.49%:  need to think about this now because you are
  22528 21.19%:  need to think about this now because you are correct
  22529 5.49%:  really need to figure out how to absorb that line
  22530 5.49%:  was totally just looking for another
  22531 5.49%:  think you need to get these
  22532 5.49%:  already know enough about this one to
  22533 5.49%:  just learned about that!!
  22534 5.49%:  need to write a book about science that goes
  22535 5.49%:  could totally see that being our entire
  22536 6.42%:  could totally see that being our entire reason
  22537 5.49%:  really need to figure out how to turn this ske
  22538 5.49%:  really thought it would be easier to just be
  22539 5.49%:  feel like that could be the answer to 
  22540 5.49%:  can totally see that being one of these
  22541 5.49%:  need to write a book about such giants before the
  22542 5.48%:  would like that to be correct because then gi
  22543 5.48%:  need to talk to you later because things
  22544 5.48%:  like where your brain goes but
  22545 5.48%:  like your ideas better than the ones for once
  22546 5.64%:  like your ideas better than the ones for once!!
  22547 5.48%:  need to think about that in a
  22548 5.48%:  think you just wrote the coolest fr
  22549 5.48%:  need to figure out how to take a
  22550 5.89%:  need to figure out how to take a breath
  22551 5.48%:  was totally gonna find
  22552 5.48%:  think you just found science the
  22553 5.48%:  think you need to write a grant for
  22554 5.48%:  think we just figured out another area
  22555 5.48%:  could totally see that being the fr
  22556 5.48%:  could totally see that being the answer if our
  22557 5.48%:  need to go write a science book about all
  22558 10.17%:  need to go write a science book about all these
  22559 5.48%:  already know enough about science to use it for better
  22560 5.48%:  think that could be a really nice
  22561 5.48%:  feel like that just got real
  22562 5.48%:  really need to think of a new career choice
  22563 5.48%:  really need to start looking at the science bro
  22564 5.48%:  need to figure out how to turn these jokes
  22565 5.48%:  think you need to be careful not to blow their
  22566 5.48%:  forgot about the other reasons
  22567 7.36%:  forgot about the other reasons we built
  22568 5.48%:  guess you could call it an
  22569 5.48%:  need to write about this soon
  22570 9.15%:  need to write about this soon before
  22571 5.48%:  think we found the secret to energy
  22572 5.48%:  think you just found the literal best
  22573 5.48%:  really need to think about this so
  22574 5.48%:  feel like this could be the best way to turn
  22575 5.48%:  feel like there should be a way to connect
  22576 5.48%:  really should think about using
  22577 5.48%:  need to figure out this theory because now
  22578 5.47%:  was just about to go check
  22579 7.22%:  was just about to go check that
  22580 5.47%:  really should be writing about that
  22581 5.47%:  like that idea better because then you
  22582 5.47%:  think you just blew the last bit
  22583 9.42%:  think you just blew the last bit of cred
  22584 5.47%:  could totally see that being the winner of our
  22585 5.47%:  think we need to figure out the rest
  22586 5.47%:  really need to think these
  22587 5.47%:  just figured out how to be the best
  22588 5.47%:  would like to see your article on that one
  22589 5.47%:  think you just changed all our best
  22590 5.47%:  need to talk to you alone right now because this bl
  22591 5.47%:  thought you were all science based
  22592 5.47%:  think you need to be serious about how
  22593 5.47%:  guess you could call that one of
  22594 14.31%:  guess you could call that one of the better
  22595 5.47%:  think you just created the coolest new belief
  22596 5.47%:  like that theory best of all because we don
  22597 5.47%:  should write a story that
  22598 5.47%:  already know enough science for a
  22599 5.47%:  feel like that was the least cred
  22600 5.47%:  would like to be the first guy to just
  22601 5.47%:  feel like you just wrote a
  22602 12.69%:  feel like you just wrote a science
  22603 6.52%:  feel like you just wrote a better
  22604 31.22%:  feel like you just wrote a better ending
  22605 34.31%:  feel like you just wrote a better ending than
  22606 5.63%:  feel like you just wrote a better ending to a
  22607 5.47%:  would like that theory to be correct because also
  22608 5.47%:  need to think about things because
  22609 5.47%:  could totally see that being the winner!!
  22610 5.47%:  was just about to tell you another one
  22611 5.47%:  think we should all agree on
  22612 5.47%:  feel like that sounds right
  22613 5.47%:  really need to figure out how to access other
  22614 5.46%:  really should know about that science better before
  22615 5.46%:  would say that that is not
  22616 5.46%:  need to go back to the library before science
  22617 5.46%:  was totally gonna end there but
  22618 5.46%:  feel like this theory could turn out to be canon
  22619 5.46%:  need to think about this for way longer at
  22620 5.46%:  think we just learned about real gi
  22621 5.46%:  was totally right about this one before
  22622 5.46%:  think you just blew our last chance to be real gi
  22623 5.46%:  feel like that could be the winner
  22624 5.46%:  think you just blew science out of order
  22625 5.46%:  guess you could write that on the back of a not
  22626 5.46%:  could totally see that being on a science t
  22627 5.46%:  need to think about this one guys
  22628 5.46%:  need to go think about that one for sure
  22629 5.46%:  think we figured out the actual secret reason
  22630 5.46%:  would like to be the first to not only
  22631 5.46%:  was just reading that
  22632 28.18%:  was just reading that theory
  22633 62.06%:  was just reading that theory online
  22634 46.88%:  was just reading that theory online!!
  22635 42.70%:  was just reading that theory online before
  22636 16.31%:  was just reading that theory on
  22637 10.96%:  was just reading that theory!!
  22638 9.34%:  was just reading that theory before
  22639 8.22%:  was just reading that theory in
  22640 6.63%:  was just reading that theory online too
  22641 5.46%:  think you just got to the core of science and blew
  22642 5.46%:  need to write a story about this one real
  22643 5.46%:  forgot about that one and it
  22644 5.46%:  feel like we should get this on
  22645 5.46%:  would like to be the first to say there can be no clear
  22646 5.46%:  need to write a book about these giant so
  22647 5.46%:  need to think about this for real because now you
  22648 5.46%:  think you just altered the entire course of 
  22649 5.46%:  think you just blew the first
  22650 5.46%:  need to get out of here because now all
  22651 5.46%:  think you just earned science
  22652 5.46%:  think we just found the secret to being a real race
  22653 5.46%:  need to figure out how to talk science theory
  22654 5.46%:  would like to be the first to not care
  22655 5.46%:  need to go think about that for a sec in
  22656 5.46%:  need to figure out a better science
  22657 5.45%:  think we should be careful not to ruin
  22658 5.45%:  need to get to the science library on
  22659 5.45%:  need to write that last
  22660 5.45%:  think you should see
  22661 5.45%:  really need to look into the science about what
  22662 5.45%:  think we found out about the secret science
  22663 5.45%:  think you just created our best chance at life
  22664 5.45%:  really like the
  22665 45.81%:  really like the idea that
  22666 17.62%:  really like the idea that we
  22667 14.02%:  really like the sound
  22668 313.19%:  really like the sound of that!!
  22669 167.93%:  really like the sound of that because
  22670 96.16%:  really like the sound of that better
  22671 76.96%:  really like the sound of that one
  22672 70.57%:  really like the sound of that one!!
  22673 64.95%:  really like the sound of this
  22674 56.68%:  really like the sound of that answer
  22675 50.73%:  really like the sound of that better!!
  22676 48.25%:  really like the sound of that but
  22677 44.99%:  really like the sound of that answer better
  22678 37.83%:  really like the sound of that answer better!!
  22679 35.49%:  really like the sound of that one better
  22680 34.00%:  really like the sound of that but it
  22681 33.42%:  really like the sound of that because now
  22682 32.54%:  really like the sound of that better now
  22683 30.19%:  really like the sound of that answer!!
  22684 29.21%:  really like the sound of that better because
  22685 28.37%:  really like the sound of that being
  22686 46.41%:  really like the sound of that being true
  22687 27.53%:  really like the sound of that one better!!
  22688 27.35%:  really like the sound of this!!
  22689 25.62%:  really like the sound of that science

  22694 18.83%:  really like the sound of that now
  22695 18.68%:  really like the sound of that giant
  22696 18.53%:  really like the sound of this one!!
  22697 17.83%:  really like the sound of that better now!!
  22698 14.27%:  really like the sound of this new
  22699 13.55%:  really like the sound of that better answer
  22700 12.23%:  really like the sound of that science!!
  22701 11.95%:  really like the sound of that being correct
  22702 11.38%:  really like the sound of this now
  22703 11.30%:  really like the idea of there
  22704 10.58%:  really like the sound of this better now
  22705 9.33%:  really like the sound of that too
  22706 8.42%:  really like the sound of that better because now
  22707 8.35%:  really like the sound of that answer but

  22710 7.92%:  really like the sound of this one better
  22711 7.74%:  really like the sound of that because now it
  22712 7.60%:  really like the sound of that because we
  22713 7.28%:  really like the sound of that answer but it
  22714 6.89%:  really like the sound of this better now!!

  22721 5.76%:  really like the sound of those
  22722 5.59%:  really like the sound of that but science
  22723 5.45%:  like your ideas better than the last one!!
  22724 5.45%:  need to write a book about all this so the
  22725 5.45%:  already know enough science that
  22726 5.45%:  think we just got our first real clue on
  22727 20.07%:  think we just got our first real clue on the
  22728 5.45%:  think we just learned about science a
  22729 5.45%:  thought you were about to reject
  22730 5.45%:  can totally get on board with this once
  22731 5.45%:  need to start looking at this
  22732 9.74%:  need to start looking at this whole
  22733 5.45%:  need to tell science about this theory for
  22734 5.45%:  think you should write to
  22735 5.45%:  need to figure out a way to listen to all our
  22736 5.45%:  feel like that should be better
  22737 5.45%:  was just about to change into
  22738 5.45%:  should write a book about being correct
  22739 5.45%:  really need to start letting science work
  22740 5.45%:  think you just wrote a great idea
  22741 5.45%:  just learned about this theory!!
  22742 5.45%:  think you just blew all our science for the better
  22743 5.45%:  would like to see you argue that one to
  22744 5.45%:  really need to look into this cause
  22745 10.21%:  really need to look into this cause that
  22746 5.45%:  feel like you just threw out a lot
  22747 5.45%:  think that could be true but
  22748 5.45%:  was totally just gonna look
  22749 8.73%:  was totally just gonna look into
  22750 5.45%:  really need to think about other
  22751 5.45%:  need to go back to school because it
  22752 5.45%:  think we just figured out the only reason al
  22753 5.45%:  really need to start looking for those

  23141 5.38%:  feel like that could be a theory
  23142 5.38%:  think you just ruined a real
  23143 5.38%:  need to think about this for rest
  23144 5.38%:  need to talk to you alone about this while
  23145 5.38%:  think we just learned about the real source
  23146 5.38%:  really need to figure out how to be an

  23155 5.38%:  really need to check that out sooner or
  23156 5.38%:  think we just figured out the noble
  23157 13.00%:  think we just figured out the noble secret
  23158 5.38%:  really should be writing these out
  23159 14.48%:  really should be writing these out before
  23160 5.38%:  would like to see a source on that before buying
  23161 5.38%:  need to write a book about all these things one
  23162 5.38%:  just figured out what all the non
  23163 5.38%:  think you found the real reason we got
  23164 5.38%:  would argue that your
  23165 5.38%:  would like that to be true only because of the insane
  23166 5.38%:  really need to start being clear
  23167 5.38%:  just learned about science through a
  23168 5.38%:  was totally gonna be the first to check
  23169 5.37%:  really should know about that before critic
  23170 5.37%:  need to get on this because it
  23171 5.37%:  think we just found our calling
  23172 5.37%:  should write a book about this better
  23173 5.37%:  should write a book about all this to
  23174 6.60%:  should write a book about all this to get
  23175 5.37%:  think we just found the coolest giant you
  23176 5.37%:  would like to note that you are being
  23177 5.37%:  should totally write that book in
  23178 12.00%:  should totally write that book in case
  23179 5.37%:  need to think about that answer for 
  23180 5.37%:  think we should be careful not to create
  23181 5.37%:  already know enough about the current
  23182 5.37%:  really need to talk about this right
  23183 39.15%:  really need to talk about this right now!!
  23184 5.37%:  think we just found a better reason to care
  23185 5.37%:  totally need to write a book to
  23186 5.37%:  think you just rewrote the course of all
  23187 5.37%:  would like to be the first to say then
  23188 5.37%:  feel like you just created the best giant
  23189 5.37%:  think you should be careful in
  23190 5.37%:  need to talk about this to science
  23191 5.37%:  feel like you just hit the answer
  23192 44.53%:  feel like you just hit the answer button on a
  23193 10.29%:  feel like you just hit the answer button and
  23194 8.27%:  feel like you just hit the answer button!!
  23195 7.45%:  feel like you just hit the answer button on a real
  23196 5.37%:  really thought it was like
  23197 5.37%:  need to get to the library like now because
  23198 5.37%:  cannot breathe right now because you just let
  23199 5.37%:  need to talk to you about being this
  23200 5.37%:  just figured out the answer to all non
  23201 5.37%:  would like to be the first to say three
  23202 5.37%:  need to go think about life now because you
  23203 5.37%:  think we just found the secret to really being cool
  23204 5.37%:  just figured out how to take
  23205 5.37%:  really need to think about the answers
  23206 5.37%:  feel like the only reason we noticed
  23207 5.37%:  like that theory better now because
  23208 5.37%:  need to think about this one before you get
  23209 5.37%:  really need to get out of here sooner than usual!!
  23210 5.37%:  need to get back to science faster
  23211 9.37%:  need to get back to science faster than
  23212 20.43%:  need to get back to science faster than you
  23213 5.37%:  forgot about the totally
  23214 11.55%:  forgot about the totally real
  23215 5.37%:  already know enough about science to use for
  23216 5.36%:  thought you were jealous
  23217 6.03%:  thought you were jealous before
  23218 5.36%:  really need to talk about science
  23219 32.83%:  really need to talk about science with other
  23220 5.36%:  just learned about the science thing!!
  23221 5.36%:  just totally figured out what real
  23222 9.83%:  just totally figured out what real science
  23223 5.36%:  need to think about this later on because you
  23224 5.36%:  really thought we talked about science not once
  23225 5.36%:  need to figure out how to say no
  23226 5.36%:  really need to think about that one before i
  23227 5.36%:  should write a book about science not
  23228 5.36%:  think you just blew all our chances for doing
  23229 5.36%:  like where your brain has been and
  23230 5.36%:  think you just brain
  23231 5.36%:  think you just created the great
  23232 19.29%:  think you just created the great science
  23233 5.36%:  feel like that theory is better
  23234 5.36%:  feel like this theory could be wrong but because
  23235 5.36%:  think you found the secret sauce
  23236 5.36%:  think you just got an idea for our
  23237 5.36%:  really need to figure out what color this
  23238 5.36%:  think we just created a really
  23239 5.36%:  really need to write a book on this subject but
  23240 5.36%:  totally just figured out where the cool
  23241 5.36%:  really need to think about this on
  23242 5.36%:  think you should be careful not to blow science
  23243 5.36%:  think you just blew all our credits
  23244 5.36%:  need to figure out how to inject you
  23245 5.36%:  need to write about this to
  23246 5.36%:  think we just figured out the control
  23247 5.36%:  need to think about that logic
  23248 5.36%:  would listen
  23249 650.10%:  would listen to that theory because
  23250 331.19%:  would listen to that theory if
  23251 261.86%:  would listen to that theory!!
  23252 96.20%:  would listen to that theory before
  23253 70.97%:  would listen to that theory for
  23254 65.26%:  would listen to that theory in
  23255 62.36%:  would listen to that theory for sure
  23256 62.32%:  would listen to that theory for like
  23257 58.15%:  would listen to that theory like
  23258 48.59%:  would listen to that theory for science
  23259 42.62%:  would listen to that theory because if
  23260 38.89%:  would listen to that theory for longer
  23261 33.69%:  would listen to this
  23262 193.50%:  would listen to this theory but
  23263 87.39%:  would listen to this theory!!
  23264 40.20%:  would listen to this theory before
  23265 36.03%:  would listen to this theory for

  23267 131.06%:  would listen to this theory for longer but
  23268 32.79%:  would listen to that theory because of
  23269 32.08%:  would listen to this theory before reject
  23270 31.17%:  would listen to that theory real
  23271 30.09%:  would listen to that because
  23272 28.44%:  would listen to that theory for sure!!
  23273 26.98%:  would listen to this theory longer
  23274 24.80%:  would listen to that theory so
  23275 23.02%:  would listen to this theory for about
  23276 22.94%:  would listen to that theory for like a
  23277 22.00%:  would listen to that theory for a
  23278 62.68%:  would listen to that theory for a long
  23279 21.22%:  would listen to this theory longer but
  23280 19.98%:  would listen to this theory but for
  23281 19.80%:  would listen to that theory on
  23282 18.80%:  would listen to that theory as
  23283 50.63%:  would listen to that theory as long
  23284 18.77%:  would listen to that theory for longer because
  23285 18.68%:  would listen to that theory longer
  23286 17.39%:  would listen to that theory because frank
  23287 15.45%:  would listen to that theory for like 
  23288 14.72%:  would listen to this theory about
  23289 14.40%:  would listen to that theory being
  23290 13.78%:  would listen to that theory closer
  23291 13.74%:  would listen to that story
  23292 13.62%:  would listen to that theory for one
  23293 13.55%:  would listen to that theory on science
  23294 13.07%:  would listen to this theory at
  23295 12.91%:  would listen to that if
  23296 12.77%:  would listen to that theory for like one
  23297 12.74%:  would listen to that because holy
  23298 11.98%:  would listen to this theory on
  23299 86.26%:  would listen to this theory on account
  23300 11.81%:  would listen to that theory like a
  23301 11.06%:  would listen to this theory for a
  23302 31.49%:  would listen to this theory for a long
  23303 11.02%:  would listen to this theory but for once
  23304 10.78%:  would listen to this theory but frank
  23305 10.58%:  would listen to that theory for real
  23306 16.23%:  would listen to that theory for real because
  23307 10.47%:  would listen to that theory because unlike
  23308 10.18%:  would listen to that theory in real
  23309 10.03%:  would listen to your
  23310 10.01%:  would listen to this theory real
  23311 9.56%:  would listen to that theory because fr
  23312 9.13%:  would listen to that!!
  23313 8.98%:  would listen to that theory because like
  23314 8.21%:  would listen to that theory again
  23315 8.11%:  would listen to that theory in an
  23316 8.10%:  would listen to that theory longer before
  23317 7.89%:  would listen to that theory for as
  23318 7.79%:  would listen to that theory because for
  23319 13.09%:  would listen to that theory because for real
  23320 11.73%:  would listen to that theory because for once in
  23321 7.42%:  would listen to that theory because bro
  23322 7.41%:  would listen to that but
  23323 7.19%:  would listen to that because there
  23324 7.16%:  would listen to that theory a
  23325 6.91%:  would listen to this theory longer before
  23326 6.86%:  would listen to this theory for one
  23327 6.74%:  would listen to that theory so long
  23328 6.69%:  would listen to that theory for like an
  23329 6.66%:  would listen to this theory for a longer
  23330 6.47%:  would listen to this theory but for one
  23331 6.46%:  would listen to that theory longer because
  23332 6.43%:  would listen to that because then
  23333 10.18%:  would listen to that because then you
  23334 6.43%:  would listen to that because you
  23335 6.19%:  would listen to that theory because being
  23336 12.28%:  would listen to that theory because being able
  23337 6.19%:  would listen to that theory long
  23338 41.70%:  would listen to that theory long before
  23339 6.06%:  would listen to that lecture
  23340 5.99%:  would listen to that theory for a longer
  23341 5.95%:  would listen to that theory because our
  23342 5.75%:  would listen to that theory because one
  23343 5.62%:  would listen to that if you
  23344 5.62%:  would listen to that theory sooner
  23345 5.40%:  would listen to that because holy freak
  23346 5.36%:  would like to see you argue that these
  23347 9.05%:  would like to see you argue that these are not
  23348 5.36%:  really need to write a science book or
  23349 5.36%:  really need to know about this before the rest
  23350 5.36%:  think we just found our secret theory
  23351 5.36%:  really need to figure out what this secret
  23352 5.36%:  think you just caused another
  23353 5.35%:  would listen to that story for
  23354 5.35%:  really should know about this before turning
  23355 5.35%:  would like to be the first one on that bus
  23356 5.35%:  feel like you just changed the natural
  23357 5.35%:  think that would be an
  23358 5.35%:  think we just found the reason our reality
  23359 5.35%:  would like this to be correct but
  23360 6.38%:  would like this to be correct but also
  23361 5.35%:  really need to figure out what those books
  23362 5.35%:  need to figure out how to buy stock in a
  23363 5.35%:  think we just found out there
  23364 6.73%:  think we just found out there are
  23365 5.35%:  need to go write that story because
  23366 5.35%:  should write a fantasy
  23367 12.53%:  should write a fantasy book
  23368 5.35%:  already know enough science about the subject of
  23369 5.35%:  think we should forget
  23370 6.01%:  think we should forget about
  23371 27.89%:  think we should forget about science
  23372 6.28%:  think we should forget about all
  23373 5.35%:  need to talk to you about this before science learn
  23374 5.35%:  need to get back to the lab with
  23375 8.38%:  need to get back to the lab with you because
  23376 5.35%:  think you just rewrote the ending to all our
  23377 5.35%:  could totally see that being the reason no
  23378 5.35%:  think you just turned that one
  23379 5.35%:  feel like this has been a good
  23380 5.35%:  should write a book about science you
  23381 5.35%:  think you just got real close to what
  23382 5.35%:  need to talk to you later because right now science
  23383 5.35%:  think this could be real because
  23384 5.35%:  feel like that theory was just created
  23385 5.34%:  would like to sinc
  23386 5.34%:  already know enough about science for both
  23387 5.34%:  already know enough science to tell that
  23388 5.34%:  think you just won science for real!!
  23389 5.34%:  like this one better than regular old
  23390 5.34%:  thought you were a friend because
  23391 5.34%:  like this one better already
  23392 5.34%:  need to write that book faster because
  23393 5.34%:  really should write that book after
  23394 5.34%:  like your ideas better than the ones we got!!
  23395 5.34%:  guess you could write that on the back of a bill or
  23396 5.34%:  think that could be a totally
  23397 5.34%:  could totally see that being the source of a new
  23398 5.34%:  really need to get out of this solar
  23399 5.34%:  thought you were all about science babies!!
  23400 5.34%:  need to write about these fake giants on
  23401 5.34%:  need to talk to you later because this one
  23402 5.34%:  just thought of a really sweet nick
  23403 5.34%:  think you just won the science lecture debate for
  23404 5.34%:  need to write a book about this subject clearly
  23405 6.96%:  need to write a book about this subject clearly enough
  23406 5.34%:  feel like that should count as correct
  23407 5.34%:  would like to be the first to steal
  23408 9.05%:  would like to be the first to steal your
  23409 5.34%:  totally should write a science book for teen
  23410 5.34%:  need to think about this a lot because now
  23411 5.34%:  was just about to check into
  23412 40.06%:  was just about to check into a hotel under
  23413 19.19%:  was just about to check into a hotel in
  23414 18.43%:  was just about to check into a hotel in your

  23419 6.31%:  was just about to check into a hotel before dinner!!
  23420 5.34%:  think we just found the secret to your being a
  23421 5.34%:  think that is correct
  23422 5.34%:  would listen to that theory real nice
  23423 5.34%:  need to start talking to fewer science
  23424 10.25%:  need to start talking to fewer science bro
  23425 5.34%:  think you just ruined a long
  23426 5.34%:  would like this to be true enough to say
  23427 5.34%:  need to write a book about this before they sue
  23428 5.34%:  like your ideas better before the
  23429 5.34%:  would like to be the first guy to let

  23433 5.33%:  think you just created the best new alien race of
  23434 5.33%:  should write a book about all the science you get
  23435 5.33%:  think we just found the secret to our one

  24278 16.35%:  guess that would be a better theory!!
  24279 14.54%:  guess that would be a better theory of
  24280 5.23%:  could totally see that being on the science for
  24281 5.23%:  need to go write that into

  24443 5.19%:  need to write a book about all the things you see
  24444 5.19%:  would like to see your science teacher at
  24445 5.19%:  really need to think about this one for a sec but
  24446 5.19%:  would like that to be correct the
  24447 5.19%:  feel like that theory could be wrong because it just
  24448 5.19%:  cannot think of a better subject
  24449 5.19%:  really need to get back in school!!
  24450 5.19%:  really need to look further
  24451 272.01%:  really need to look further into this because
  24452 243.59%:  really need to look further into this!!
  24453 112.20%:  really need to look further into that
  24454 72.56%:  really need to look further into this one
  24455 105.23%:  really need to look further into this one because

  24458 51.15%:  really need to look further into that!!
  24459 43.76%:  really need to look further into that one
  24460 79.43%:  really need to look further into that one because
  24461 36.69%:  really need to look further into this now
  24462 78.82%:  really need to look further into this now because
  24463 35.83%:  really need to look further into this one!!
  24464 26.39%:  really need to look further into that one!!
  24465 20.88%:  really need to look further into this subject
  24466 16.37%:  really need to look further into this because w
  24467 15.83%:  really need to look further into this now!!
  24468 13.84%:  really need to look further into what
  24469 12.26%:  really need to look further into that science
  24470 11.35%:  really need to look further into the
  24471 305.89%:  really need to look further into the science
  24472 29.89%:  really need to look further into the subject
  24473 11.05%:  really need to look further into that because now
  24474 10.33%:  really need to look further into this subject!!
  24475 9.25%:  really need to look further into the subject!!
  24476 9.03%:  really need to look further into this so
  24477 8.97%:  really need to look further into these
  24478 18.69%:  really need to look further into these giant
  24479 8.71%:  really need to look further into this because we
  24480 8.43%:  really need to look further into science
  24481 7.51%:  really need to look further into the science!!
  24482 7.40%:  really need to look further into the science about
  24483 5.55%:  really need to look further into this because we can
  24484 5.35%:  really need to look further into the science to
  24485 5.19%:  think the science just blew
  24486 5.19%:  need to write a book about these changes
  24487 5.19%:  like that idea better because now they
  24488 5.19%:  like your idea better after that
  24489 5.19%:  could totally write a science book star
  24490 5.19%:  think we just figured out the l
  24491 5.19%:  need to think about this a lot for
  24492 5.19%:  really need to talk about this further!!
  24493 5.19%:  need to talk to you about this before science!!
  24494 5.19%:  would like this to be the story of our
  24495 5.19%:  like this better because now
  24496 5.23%:  like this better because now there
  24497 5.19%:  forgot that
  24498 8.32%:  forgot that dark
  24499 5.19%:  could totally see that being one of those urban
  24500 5.19%:  just got the best idea for an article on how
  24501 5.19%:  should write a book because clearly
  24502 5.36%:  should write a book because clearly there
  24503 5.19%:  thought we could just
  24504 5.19%:  was totally looking for the chance to insert
  24505 5.19%:  just thought of a way to rescue
  24506 16.38%:  just thought of a way to rescue dark
  24507 5.19%:  feel like you just watched the last
  24508 5.19%:  need to talk to you about the science earlier
  24509 5.19%:  would like to see the science content
  24510 20.46%:  would like to see the science content of your
  24511 5.19%:  already know enough about science to be le
  24512 5.19%:  feel like science just got a lot harder
  24513 5.19%:  would like to clarify that these are just one
  24514 5.19%:  need to talk to you about the science now!!
  24515 5.19%:  would say that that is one
  24516 5.19%:  need to figure out a way to search
  24517 5.18%:  already know enough about science for it to be ru
  24518 5.18%:  think you just ruined one of the great sc
  24519 5.18%:  think that could really be a
  24520 5.18%:  already know enough about science to rule the
  24521 5.18%:  thought you looked
  24522 5.18%:  would argue that these are still not
  24523 5.18%:  cannot begin to tell you how that idea bl
  24524 5.18%:  need to write a book before science totally
  24525 5.18%:  need to talk about this later when
  24526 5.18%:  really need to figure out what others
  24527 5.18%:  think you need to watch
  24528 14.37%:  think you need to watch less
  24529 8.98%:  think you need to watch less cart
  24530 5.18%:  guess you could write that book!!
  24531 5.18%:  would like to see your science on that real
  24532 5.18%:  could totally see that being in a book one
  24533 5.18%:  need to talk to you about this when our science
  24534 5.18%:  should write a book about nothing
  24535 18.88%:  should write a book about nothing but
  24536 12.69%:  should write a book about nothing because
  24537 5.18%:  really need to get back to this sooner
  24538 14.05%:  really need to get back to this sooner than
  24539 5.18%:  need to write an essay for
  24540 5.18%:  could totally see that working in current
  24541 5.18%:  like that idea better than yours so
  24542 5.18%:  really need to write a science book that goes
  24543 5.18%:  think we just figured out not only the role
  24544 5.18%:  would like to see you argue that one to the
  24545 5.18%:  think you just won the debate bro
  24546 5.18%:  need to think about this real closely for
  24547 5.18%:  need to write a fantasy
  24548 10.08%:  need to write a fantasy book
  24549 12.88%:  need to write a fantasy book right
  24550 5.18%:  can totally see how that is correct
  24551 5.18%:  need to talk to you about this longer because if
  24552 5.18%:  think we found the secret to long
  24553 5.18%:  need to talk to you right after lunch
  24554 20.75%:  need to talk to you right after lunch because
  24555 5.18%:  already know enough about science to be sure of it
  24556 5.18%:  think this could totally be an
  24557 6.02%:  think this could totally be an answer
  24558 5.18%:  think you just wrote a better ending for us
  24559 5.18%:  need to talk to you because
  24560 5.83%:  need to talk to you because this
  24561 5.17%:  think you figured out the secret on
  24562 5.17%:  need to think about this longer clearly
  24563 8.24%:  need to think about this longer clearly because
  24564 8.03%:  need to think about this longer clearly before
  24565 5.17%:  really need to check into this because now
  24566 5.17%:  think you found the secret to not
  24567 5.17%:  need to get to the library like three
  24568 5.17%:  need to start talking to you earlier
  24569 5.17%:  think you figured out the secret between
  24570 5.17%:  just thought of a way science could take
  24571 5.17%:  need to go back to the start of our
  24572 5.17%:  really need to figure out how to see this
  24573 5.17%:  already know enough about this subject to br
  24574 5.17%:  would not
  24575 13.04%:  would not be against
  24576 236.45%:  would not be against that theory
  24577 99.20%:  would not be against that theory!!
  24578 51.36%:  would not be against this
  24579 358.95%:  would not be against this theory
  24580 271.50%:  would not be against this theory at
  24581 138.47%:  would not be against this theory!!
  24582 57.90%:  would not be against this theory one
  24583 35.94%:  would not be against that theory one
  24584 24.47%:  would not be against that!!
  24585 20.36%:  would not be against this at
  24586 18.02%:  would not be against that theory in
  24587 10.37%:  would not be against that theory if
  24588 9.83%:  would not be against this!!
  24589 8.85%:  would not be against such
  24590 53.74%:  would not be against such a theory!!
  24591 20.85%:  would not be against such a theory one
  24592 104.11%:  would not be against such a theory one little
  24593 7.83%:  would not be against such a theory for
  24594 7.60%:  would not be against this theory for
  24595 43.21%:  would not be against this theory for one
  24596 6.47%:  would not be against this theory of
  24597 5.47%:  would not be against that theory for
  24598 5.17%:  need to talk to this guy about a
  24599 5.17%:  just got the best idea for a lunch
  24600 5.17%:  would like that theory to be fact
  24601 5.17%:  was totally right about the bro
  24602 7.13%:  was totally right about the bros!!
  24603 5.17%:  was totally just gonna end there!!
  24604 5.17%:  really need to think about this for ten
  24605 5.17%:  should write a book about that energy
  24606 5.17%:  like this theory because we call
  24607 5.17%:  think we just found the real reason you got to
  24608 5.17%:  really need to figure out how to talk trash
  24609 5.17%:  think you just found science!!
  24610 5.17%:  feel like there should be a cartoon saying
  24611 5.17%:  think we just found out the real reason i
  24612 5.17%:  think we just figured out the coolest baby
  24613 5.17%:  would like this to be true so fr
  24614 5.17%:  need to talk to you about all the non
  24615 5.17%:  can totally see that being the world
  24616 5.17%:  need to think about this closely before correct
  24617 5.17%:  would like to be this
  24618 6.17%:  would like to be this theory
  24619 5.17%:  should write a book telling that
  24620 21.05%:  should write a book telling that story!!
  24621 8.54%:  should write a book telling that secret
  24622 8.33%:  should write a book telling that secret!!
  24623 5.17%:  would like this to be the case only for
  24624 5.17%:  forgot about that because they don
  24625 5.17%:  would like that to be true if only because than
  24626 5.16%:  can totally see how that could be f
  24627 5.16%:  need to talk to you about light sources
  24628 5.16%:  feel like we just had an
  24629 5.16%:  already know enough science to be the cool
  24630 5.16%:  really need to figure out how to enter the
  24631 5.16%:  would like to see science try
  24632 5.65%:  would like to see science try to argue
  24633 7.38%:  would like to see science try to argue that
  24634 7.47%:  would like to see science try to argue that one!!
  24635 5.16%:  need to get on this theory like now
  24636 5.16%:  think we found the real secret to being a real
  24637 5.16%:  need to get to the library because this one
  24638 5.16%:  would like to be the first to be brought
  24639 5.16%:  really need to think about this just
  24640 10.17%:  really need to think about this just now
  24641 5.16%:  just figured out the answer to a three
  24642 5.16%:  could totally write a book about these fr
  24643 5.16%:  would like this to be the only reason for
  24644 5.16%:  need to write a book about this strange
  24645 5.16%:  feel like you just heard the entire
  24646 5.16%:  totally forgot that science is real
  24647 5.16%:  really need to write a letter
  24648 5.16%:  like your ideas better than these are
  24649 5.16%:  need to write that on the
  24650 11.23%:  need to write that on the black
  24651 7.30%:  need to write that on the back
  24652 22.40%:  need to write that on the back of a
  24653 6.28%:  need to write that on the back of all
  24654 5.80%:  need to write that on the back of a bill
  24655 5.16%:  can see how that could be really boring
  24656 5.16%:  think we just got our theory
  24657 5.16%:  really need to look into this because how can
  24658 5.16%:  think we just found another real
  24659 5.16%:  need to go back to the library because fr
  24660 5.16%:  need to think about this for one year
  24661 6.04%:  need to think about this for one year because
  24662 5.16%:  already know enough about science to reject this bl
  24663 5.16%:  would like to forget
  24664 16.33%:  would like to forget this
  24665 11.84%:  would like to forget that
  24666 17.50%:  would like to forget that entire
  24667 9.56%:  would like to forget that theory
  24668 6.92%:  would like to forget that last
  24669 6.88%:  would like to forget that you
  24670 5.49%:  would like to forget that just
  24671 5.16%:  would like this to be the actual reason for our
  24672 5.16%:  think you just found the secret to a global
  24673 5.16%:  need to write a book about this because hey
  24674 5.16%:  think we just found a totally legit
  24675 32.13%:  think we just found a totally legit reason
  24676 5.16%:  can totally see that being true for sure!!
  24677 5.16%:  need to go write a science book because you
  24678 5.16%:  think you just got a new
  24679 82.18%:  think you just got a new friend!!
  24680 11.58%:  think you just got a new best

  24685 5.56%:  think you just got a new friend there
  24686 5.16%:  feel like this could be another reason to get
  24687 5.16%:  would like to see your source for that that
  24688 5.16%:  really need to think about this one a lot before we
  24689 5.16%:  need to tell this story at a
  24690 5.16%:  really should know about science better for that
  24691 5.16%:  could totally write a book on that science
  24692 5.16%:  like you
  24693 17.28%:  like you better
  24694 9.42%:  like you better without
  24695 17.82%:  like you better without those
  24696 13.12%:  like you better without the
  24697 10.58%:  like you better without these
  24698 7.39%:  like you better with
  24699 6.96%:  like you better before
  24700 5.97%:  like you better with less
  24701 5.66%:  like you better without all
  24702 14.30%:  like you better without all these
  24703 8.31%:  like you better without all those
  24704 5.16%:  like you better with regular
  24705 5.16%:  like how you just said that out
  24706 5.15%:  cannot begin to tell you how bad those
  24707 7.90%:  cannot begin to tell you how bad those last
  24708 5.15%:  should write a story about it then
  24709 5.15%:  would like that to be the case if you just
  24710 5.15%:  forgot to include that one because clearly those
  24711 5.15%:  think we just found the great
  24712 8.21%:  think we just found the great science
  24713 7.31%:  think we just found the great secret
  24714 5.15%:  need to think about that before you ruin all
  24715 5.15%:  think you just got real close to correct!!
  24716 5.15%:  think you just changed science but
  24717 5.15%:  feel like we should be saying that but
  24718 5.15%:  think we should go to
  24719 5.15%:  really need to figure out how to obtain
  24720 5.15%:  need to think about this a lot longer before res
  24721 5.15%:  think we should contact
  24722 5.15%:  should write a book about science then
  24723 5.15%:  think you just altered the course of two
  24724 5.15%:  should totally write the book for
  24725 5.15%:  thought you were just a nice
  24726 35.94%:  thought you were just a nice friend
  24727 17.77%:  thought you were just a nice friend!!
  24728 5.15%:  need to go write a story about science
  24729 5.15%:  think you just learned about science all
  24730 5.15%:  would be really into that because science!!
  24731 5.15%:  think you just created a new race of beings to
  24732 5.15%:  think we just figured out a reason to not
  24733 5.15%:  think you just got the coolest new
  24734 27.69%:  think you just got the coolest new friend
  24735 14.32%:  think you just got the coolest new friend!!
  24736 11.09%:  think you just got the coolest new idea

  24738 7.60%:  think you just got the coolest new idea for a
  24739 5.15%:  like this better than regular ol
  24740 5.15%:  think you just blew all of science outta the ocean
  24741 5.15%:  guess they could be the
  24742 5.15%:  need to figure out this whole
  24743 5.15%:  really need to look into this because how are
  24744 5.15%:  think we found our secret to
  24745 35.22%:  think we found our secret to eternal
  24746 913.60%:  think we found our secret to eternal youth!!
  24747 13.08%:  think we found our secret to eternal youth babies
  24748 5.15%:  need to think about this for longer because we
  24749 8.56%:  need to think about this for longer because we are
  24750 5.15%:  need to think about this because we are not
  24751 5.15%:  need to get out of the house because now
  24752 5.15%:  really need to talk to science faster
  24753 5.15%:  really need to think about these giant bros before
  24754 5.15%:  really need to get back to science now
  24755 5.14%:  would like to be the first guest to
  24756 5.14%:  can totally see how that could be non
  24757 5.14%:  need to go think about this clearly
  24758 8.13%:  need to go think about this clearly because
  24759 5.67%:  need to go think about this clearly before
  24760 5.14%:  would like to say that before
  24761 5.14%:  think you just got on
  24762 41.23%:  think you just got on the science
  24763 14.38%:  think you just got on the front
  24764 5.55%:  think you just got on the science bullet
  24765 5.51%:  think you just got on the list
  24766 17.68%:  think you just got on the list for
  24767 5.14%:  really need to take

  24773 50.24%:  really need to take another shower
  24774 17.09%:  really need to take another science
  24775 9.50%:  really need to take another shower soon
  24776 9.42%:  really need to take another course
  24777 8.54%:  really need to take another shower!!

  24780 6.47%:  really need to take a shower soon
  24781 5.61%:  really need to take another course on
  24782 5.14%:  think we just totally ruined our chance
  24783 5.14%:  think you just changed science to better
  24784 5.14%:  think you just ruined the rest of all
  24785 5.14%:  like how you changed
  24786 5.14%:  think the science just got real!!
  24787 5.14%:  think this could be real!!
  24788 5.14%:  really should get into
  24789 32.67%:  really should get into science
  24790 8.94%:  really should get into science before
  24791 8.34%:  really should get into this
  24792 5.31%:  really should get into science after
  24793 5.14%:  could totally see that being true science
  24794 5.14%:  forgot about that because they sound
  24795 14.74%:  forgot about that because they sound like
  24796 5.14%:  think you just blew all our chances to get into a
  24797 5.14%:  need to call science about this theory
  24798 5.14%:  really need to take a shower!!
  24799 5.14%:  think we just found out they
  24800 5.14%:  think you just threw out an entire
  24801 5.14%:  was just about to lecture
  24802 5.14%:  could totally see this being a better
  24803 5.14%:  forgot to include that because you
  24804 12.88%:  forgot to include that because you know
  24805 5.14%:  need to figure out how to talk about science by
  24806 5.14%:  think we just learned about the nature of cos
  24807 5.14%:  think you just crashed into
  24808 5.14%:  feel like you just wrote that out
  24809 5.14%:  kinda wish they
  24810 5.14%:  feel like this changes
  24811 5.14%:  need to think about this before you can tell
  24812 5.13%:  think that would be a great science story
  24813 7.01%:  think that would be a great science story for
  24814 5.13%:  need to talk to you alone because this whole
  24815 5.13%:  need to get back to the science library real
  24816 5.13%:  need to think about this one because fr
  24817 5.13%:  think you just found the real answer to a 
  24818 5.13%:  really need to think about this one because our
  24819 5.13%:  would like that to be true because science only
  24820 5.13%:  feel like the science world just got the
  24821 5.13%:  like that theory because it would be great
  24822 5.13%:  think you just rewrote all of our
  24823 25.78%:  think you just rewrote all of our science
  24824 19.67%:  think you just rewrote all of our science and
  24825 12.05%:  think you just rewrote all of our science!!
  24826 5.13%:  really like that ending better because now
  24827 5.13%:  feel like that could be a correct answer in
  24828 5.13%:  really need to think about that one for sure!!
  24829 5.13%:  need to write a book about that if
  24830 7.20%:  need to write a book about that if only
  24831 5.13%:  need to write about these fake things
  24832 5.13%:  could totally see that being a true
  24833 5.13%:  need to talk to you alone for a bit!!
  24834 5.13%:  would like to say that is a better
  24835 5.13%:  would like that better
  24836 14.61%:  would like that better than
  24837 19.77%:  would like that better than regular
  24838 36.71%:  would like that better than regular science
  24839 8.84%:  would like that better than regular science!!
  24840 5.17%:  would like that better than being
  24841 6.94%:  would like that better than being alone
  24842 5.13%:  feel like this theory could be wrong too because
  24843 5.13%:  could totally see that working for science ner
  24844 5.13%:  think you found the secret to being a true bro
  24845 5.13%:  think we should get science
  24846 5.13%:  need to talk to you about science when there
  24847 5.13%:  should write a book about all the science content
  24848 5.12%:  need to figure out how to turn these really
  24849 5.12%:  cannot begin to tell you how bad this just
  24850 5.12%:  just figured out how to create science
  24851 5.12%:  think we just figured out a really cool secret!!
  24852 5.12%:  need to start taking notes while
  24853 5.12%:  think you just hit on a new career for us all!!
  24854 5.12%:  really need to write a book about secret
  24855 7.29%:  really need to write a book about secret things
  24856 5.12%:  need to get to the library now before
  24857 6.03%:  need to get to the library now before the
  24858 5.12%:  need to talk to you about this where no
  24859 5.12%:  thought you were an al
  24860 5.12%:  need to write that essay for
  24861 5.12%:  guess you could write another article
  24862 5.12%:  think you just blew all our science for that
  24863 11.84%:  think you just blew all our science for that one
  24864 9.76%:  think you just blew all our science for that one!!
  24865 5.12%:  was just about to thank you for being bored
  24866 5.12%:  really gotta
  24867 5.12%:  need to go write that book before
  24868 5.12%:  was just about to finally get
  24869 5.12%:  need to go write a book about this subject
  24870 5.12%:  need to write a letter to science books
  24871 5.12%:  need to get to the science library to answer all
  24872 5.12%:  would like that to be the case before
  24873 5.48%:  would like that to be the case before anyone
  24874 5.12%:  like this theory better because we cannot
  24875 5.12%:  feel like we should just agree they
  24876 5.12%:  would like that to be the case just for you alone!!
  24877 5.12%:  like that ending better than real
  24878 5.12%:  think the science world just fell
  24879 5.12%:  like this theory and also want
  24880 7.38%:  like this theory and also want to be
  24881 5.12%:  really need to listen to these
  24882 5.12%:  kinda want that to be right so
  24883 5.12%:  forgot to include that theory because because
  24884 5.12%:  really need to get on that science faster!!
  24885 5.12%:  totally just forgot
  24886 19.21%:  totally just forgot about science
  24887 10.13%:  totally just forgot about science!!
  24888 5.35%:  totally just forgot about science and
  24889 6.41%:  totally just forgot about science and now
  24890 5.12%:  would like to see your license
  24891 5.12%:  think we need to figure out the secret
  24892 5.12%:  think you just wrote science fact!!
  24893 5.12%:  think you just found the real answer to a big
  24894 5.12%:  like that theory best because of
  24895 5.12%:  was just talking about not
  24896 5.11%:  need to go think about those
  24897 5.11%:  really need to figure out how to obtain a
  24898 5.11%:  think you need to tell that one
  24899 5.11%:  really need to start talking to science before
  24900 5.11%:  really need to figure out how to ask
  24901 5.11%:  need to write this fantasy book
  24902 5.11%:  need to write a book about these giant be
  24903 5.11%:  think you just got the idea for one
  24904 5.11%:  forgot to check that one because it really
  24905 5.49%:  forgot to check that one because it really wouldn
  24906 5.11%:  think you just turned all the giant
  24907 5.11%:  need to write that fan theory because
  24908 5.11%:  think you just earned enough
  24909 5.11%:  really need to learn about science right the
  24910 5.11%:  think you found the secret to real
  24911 46.13%:  think you found the secret to real science
  24912 35.66%:  think you found the secret to real science!!
  24913 5.11%:  think we should figure
  24914 5.11%:  think you just got that idea because
  24915 5.11%:  just thought of it and you beat
  24916 5.11%:  need to get out of this reality real
  24917 5.11%:  think we need to get serious
  24918 59.30%:  think we need to get serious about our
  24919 30.44%:  think we need to get serious about our theory
  24920 17.45%:  think we need to get serious about the
  24921 5.11%:  need to go think about that in a cooler
  24922 5.11%:  think this could really be our
  24923 7.33%:  think this could really be our best
  24924 5.11%:  would like that to be a real theory but
  24925 5.11%:  guess you could call that a non
  24926 5.11%:  need to think about this real long
  24927 5.11%:  really need to figure out what to think
  24928 5.11%:  feel like there should be a song
  24929 58.61%:  feel like there should be a song about
  24930 17.31%:  feel like there should be a song written
  24931 126.91%:  feel like there should be a song written about our
  24932 83.31%:  feel like there should be a song written about you
  24933 20.99%:  feel like there should be a song written about your
  24934 17.34%:  feel like there should be a song written about you!!
  24935 8.66%:  feel like there should be a song about it
  24936 5.86%:  feel like there should be a song about your
  24937 5.11%:  would like to hear about nothing else for years!!
  24938 5.11%:  could totally see that being one of the new
  24939 5.11%:  think that last
  24940 5.84%:  think that last idea
  24941 5.11%:  think the answer really
  24942 5.11%:  totally just learned about string
  24943 5.11%:  feel like you just ruined the correct
  24944 5.11%:  feel like you just created another giant hole
  24945 5.10%:  like your ideas better better now
  24946 5.10%:  think we just found our best chance at a
  24947 5.10%:  think you need to be careful who
  24948 5.10%:  would like to say that science cannot be
  24949 5.10%:  need to get to the science library to follow
  24950 5.10%:  would like to see that action
  24951 5.10%:  think you just created an honest
  24952 5.10%:  really like that one because
  24953 11.38%:  really like that one because it doesn
  24954 7.93%:  really like that one because it turns
  24955 5.10%:  really need to know about this because if
  24956 5.10%:  think that could be our answer to all
  24957 11.23%:  think that could be our answer to all science
  24958 8.70%:  think that could be our answer to all our
  24959 15.47%:  think that could be our answer to all our science
  24960 5.10%:  really need to write this fan
  24961 5.10%:  can hardly contain the
  24962 5.10%:  really need to get on that science club
  24963 5.10%:  think you just blew all our chances!!
  24964 5.10%:  would like to say that before this
  24965 5.10%:  feel like that was just
  24966 5.10%:  would like to be the first author to be
  24967 5.10%:  think you just got the coolest fr
  24968 5.10%:  think you just created a new science brother
  24969 5.10%:  need to talk to you about how this is an
  24970 5.10%:  think you just lost that
  24971 8.41%:  think you just lost that round
  24972 5.10%:  would like to be the first one to not be able
  24973 5.10%:  would like to see your science teacher for an
  24974 5.10%:  should write that in a story book
  24975 5.10%:  just blew
  24976 12.60%:  just blew your
  24977 7.36%:  just blew your entire
  24978 12.93%:  just blew your entire science
  24979 7.21%:  just blew your freak
  24980 5.10%:  just learned about that theory!!
  24981 5.10%:  think that would count as real science!!
  24982 5.10%:  would like to hear about this story later
  24983 5.09%:  think this could be totally correct!!
  24984 5.09%:  really should know better than to react
  24985 5.09%:  was just about to be
  24986 10.49%:  was just about to be done

  25013 5.17%:  was just about to be done being really
  25014 5.09%:  would like to see that theory first
  25015 5.09%:  need to write a book about this surely
  25016 5.09%:  would like that to be true because then anyone
  25017 5.09%:  really think we should be testing
  25018 5.09%:  totally need to write a science book to clear
  25019 5.09%:  need to figure out what colour the stars
  25020 5.09%:  would like to see that on the big

  25028 32.58%:  really need to figure out how to lose at science
  25029 5.50%:  really need to figure out how to lose at these
  25030 5.09%:  could totally see that being correct when
  25031 5.09%:  need to start working for the
  25032 23.80%:  need to start working for the science
  25033 5.09%:  need to talk to you about the whole science being
  25034 5.09%:  really need to think about it now
  25035 6.78%:  really need to think about it now because
  25036 5.09%:  thought we could talk about real science!!
  25037 5.09%:  thought you were just a friend not
  25038 28.45%:  thought you were just a friend not a science
  25039 65.25%:  thought you were just a friend not a science bro
  25040 53.41%:  thought you were just a friend not a science bro!!
  25041 5.09%:  just figured out the answer to cancer
  25042 5.09%:  really need to write that book real
  25043 5.09%:  should write a book about all these f
  25044 5.09%:  need to talk to you about how this is a
  25045 5.09%:  need to figure out how to bill
  25046 11.99%:  need to figure out how to bill you
  25047 8.05%:  need to figure out how to bill these
  25048 5.09%:  would like to see the source on that before buying
  25049 5.09%:  think we just changed science totally!!
  25050 5.09%:  can see where
  25051 20.22%:  can see where this
  25052 8.44%:  can see where that
  25053 6.84%:  can see where that idea
  25054 6.69%:  can see where this line
  25055 5.26%:  can see where that could
  25056 11.85%:  can see where that could be true
  25057 9.29%:  can see where that could be true!!
  25058 6.04%:  can see where that could get
  25059 5.78%:  can see where that could get really
  25060 5.09%:  already know enough about science to either
  25061 5.09%:  feel like that is the correct
  25062 175.56%:  feel like that is the correct answer and
  25063 154.27%:  feel like that is the correct answer to
  25064 58.94%:  feel like that is the correct answer but
  25065 35.18%:  feel like that is the correct answer!!
  25066 23.13%:  feel like that is the correct answer and you
  25067 21.75%:  feel like that is the correct answer but nobody
  25068 19.06%:  feel like that is the correct answer and yet
  25069 17.19%:  feel like that is the correct answer to a
  25070 16.75%:  feel like that is the correct answer to any
  25071 14.00%:  feel like that is the correct answer you
  25072 8.04%:  feel like that is the correct answer about
  25073 6.13%:  feel like that is the correct answer and not
  25074 6.05%:  feel like that is the correct answer but only
  25075 5.90%:  feel like that is the correct answer to one
  25076 5.13%:  feel like that is the correct answer and only
  25077 5.09%:  really need to talk about these things for
  25078 5.09%:  feel like you just threw a science
  25079 5.09%:  feel like that would count as science theory
  25080 5.09%:  think you just ruined the last of
  25081 5.09%:  could totally see that being our secret
  25082 5.09%:  was just about to let
  25083 5.33%:  was just about to let you think
  25084 5.09%:  could totally see that being the source of one
  25085 5.09%:  gotta write this book
  25086 5.65%:  gotta write this book already
  25087 5.09%:  need to go write a book about this fast!!
  25088 5.09%:  feel like we should get to that
  25089 17.25%:  feel like we should get to that sooner
  25090 6.20%:  feel like we should get to that sooner in
  25091 5.09%:  think we need to start another blog
  25092 5.09%:  really thought it would be a
  25093 5.09%:  already know enough about science th
  25094 5.08%:  could totally write a science book about these huge
  25095 5.08%:  like this theory best of all and cannot
  25096 5.08%:  always kinda
  25097 67.69%:  always kinda thought it
  25098 6.36%:  always kinda thought so
  25099 14.51%:  always kinda thought so too
  25100 5.08%:  think you just changed all science for real!!
  25101 5.08%:  would like that to be true because then life
  25102 6.96%:  would like that to be true because then life can
  25103 5.08%:  think that counts
  25104 5.08%:  really need to start wearing these
  25105 5.08%:  need to go write a book about all the secrets

  25107 13.21%:  need to write a story about such a thing!!
  25108 9.05%:  need to write a story about such a being
  25109 5.08%:  like your idea better too because
  25110 5.08%:  need to talk to science about how this
  25111 5.08%:  cannot breathe right now because you used
  25112 5.08%:  would like to be the first to say not on
  25113 5.08%:  think you just created the first real new
  25114 5.08%:  need to go write a science book stat!!
  25115 5.08%:  need to figure out how to say that in as
  25116 5.08%:  need to think about this before our
  25117 5.08%:  think you just blew all of science outta the god
  25118 5.08%:  need to write a book about this beauty
  25119 5.08%:  need to get back to you on this one because all the
  25120 5.08%:  just thought of a really intense idea
  25121 5.08%:  think we just got closer to the real deal
  25122 5.08%:  would like that to be the case for any
  25123 6.89%:  would like that to be the case for any science
  25124 5.08%:  think you need to be serious about that bro
  25125 5.08%:  think you just blew our last chance of being elected
  25126 5.08%:  feel like you should be using that one
  25127 5.08%:  really should know better than to be curious
  25128 5.08%:  totally just figured out the science on
  25129 5.08%:  think the answer is you are
  25130 5.08%:  already know enough about this subject for ten
  25131 5.08%:  think we just figured out one reason to care
  25132 5.07%:  think we just found the coolest race
  25133 5.07%:  feel like that would just
  25134 6.24%:  feel like that would just be another
  25135 15.58%:  feel like that would just be another reason
  25136 7.02%:  feel like that would just be another giant
  25137 6.83%:  feel like that would just be another reason to be
  25138 5.23%:  feel like that would just be another reason not
  25139 5.07%:  need to write that song
  25140 5.07%:  really need to know about this because if there
  25141 5.07%:  need to get to the library fast because now
  25142 5.07%:  forgot about the non
  25143 5.07%:  really need to figure out how to breath
  25144 11.20%:  really need to figure out how to breath because
  25145 5.07%:  think we found the real reason to go
  25146 5.07%:  would like that to be true because of the insane
  25147 5.07%:  think we figured out our
  25148 5.17%:  think we figured out our theory
  25149 5.07%:  could totally see that being one answer
  25150 5.07%:  would like to hear about this journey
  25151 5.07%:  cannot think of a better way to cure
  25152 5.07%:  feel like that would ruin
  25153 5.07%:  like how you just ignored
  25154 5.07%:  think we should tell science about you
  25155 5.07%:  need to write a story about the science
  25156 5.07%:  think you just learned science for
  25157 10.33%:  think you just learned science for real
  25158 5.07%:  think you just created one of those giant bro
  25159 5.07%:  can totally see that working if there
  25160 5.07%:  feel like we just changed our
  25161 53.50%:  feel like we just changed our entire con
  25162 6.41%:  feel like we just changed our entire out
  25163 5.39%:  feel like we just changed our reality
  25164 5.07%:  just figured out the real reason we can
  25165 5.07%:  would like to see your notes on that later!!
  25166 5.07%:  think you just got the best idea on
  25167 5.07%:  feel like that would be such a big
  25168 5.07%:  forgot to check that one because all
  25169 5.07%:  was just about to go to bed early
  25170 5.07%:  need to get out of science because you
  25171 5.07%:  really need to get on that because this
  25172 5.07%:  would like that to be true because it conf
  25173 5.07%:  should write a book about that if you
  25174 5.07%:  was just about to order another
  25175 6.27%:  was just about to order another chicken
  25176 5.07%:  need to write a book about this because then one
  25177 5.07%:  already know enough about science to rule both
  25178 5.07%:  like your idea better because that one
  25179 5.07%:  need to think about that one for real serious!!
  25180 5.07%:  like your idea better now than before the
  25181 5.07%:  forgot to include that because when you talk
  25182 5.07%:  really should write about this for
  25183 5.06%:  think you just won the giant debate because
  25184 5.06%:  just figured out how to be totally science
  25185 5.06%:  need to get back in school because
  25186 7.41%:  need to get back in school because that
  25187 5.06%:  need to figure out how to use that one
  25188 5.06%:  need to go think about that serious
  25189 5.06%:  think you just won the logic debate for
  25190 17.56%:  think you just won the logic debate for once
  25191 9.99%:  think you just won the logic debate for once!!
  25192 5.06%:  think that could be your best answer
  25193 5.06%:  need to call the science library before
  25194 5.06%:  could totally see that being the answer if one
  25195 5.06%:  need to call the science guys about that one for
  25196 5.06%:  think you just wrote the end to
  25197 5.06%:  need to figure out how to license that one real
  25198 5.06%:  need to figure out a way to kill
  25199 6.07%:  need to figure out a way to kill that
  25200 5.06%:  need to figure out how to insert your
  25201 5.06%:  would like that to be the case but if you
  25202 5.06%:  was totally right about their non
  25203 5.06%:  would argue that this is not only correct
  25204 5.06%:  need to write a book about the science fact
  25205 5.06%:  need to write a book about that on
  25206 5.06%:  feel like this could be your new
  25207 5.06%:  think you need to be alone for
  25208 179.92%:  think you need to be alone for a while because
  25209 88.69%:  think you need to be alone for a little
  25210 30.54%:  think you need to be alone for a while to
  25211 29.04%:  think you need to be alone for a while!!
  25212 10.07%:  think you need to be alone for awhile
  25213 10.55%:  think you need to be alone for awhile because
  25214 7.53%:  think you need to be alone for a while to let
  25215 5.66%:  think you need to be alone for a while because just
  25216 5.06%:  think you just changed our fr
  25217 5.06%:  think you need to be careful about how little
  25218 6.10%:  think you need to be careful about how little sense
  25219 5.06%:  really need to look into that before science ru
  25220 5.06%:  feel like you just turned into a better
  25221 5.06%:  need to talk to you after school because we
  25222 5.06%:  think you figured out the secret real
  25223 5.06%:  think you figured out the secret to non
  25224 5.06%:  need to go back to the library for this
  25225 10.37%:  need to go back to the library for this one because
  25226 5.06%:  really need to get on this sooner!!
  25227 5.05%:  think we found the secret reason to
  25228 5.05%:  cannot begin to tell you how absurd it
  25229 5.05%:  really need to work on being better at this false
  25230 5.05%:  think we just totally ruined our chance to
  25231 5.05%:  need to talk to you about the science now because
  25232 5.05%:  need to write a book about this cause there
  25233 5.05%:  forgot about that other
  25234 11.46%:  forgot about that other reason
  25235 5.05%:  think you just brought down all science bro
  25236 5.05%:  would like to be the first contact
  25237 5.05%:  need to talk to you about this because before we
  25238 5.05%:  just noticed that this
  25239 5.05%:  can see where that could get you
  25240 5.05%:  think we just found out the cool
  25241 5.69%:  think we just found out the coolest real
  25242 5.05%:  think we just figured out all the loose
  25243 5.05%:  need to think about all that
  25244 5.05%:  guess they could be real after that
  25245 5.05%:  should write a story about that !!
  25246 5.05%:  just figured out the real reason why black
  25247 5.05%:  need to get to work on that screen
  25248 5.05%:  need to write another story about gi
  25249 5.05%:  think we should totally go on a first
  25250 5.05%:  just figured out how to be both
  25251 5.05%:  can totally see that being used on
  25252 10.88%:  can totally see that being used on the
  25253 6.49%:  can totally see that being used on future
  25254 5.05%:  really need to look into how
  25255 5.05%:  need to start calling the
  25256 5.05%:  need to think about this really real
  25257 5.05%:  need to figure out how to talk to a
  25258 5.05%:  would like to go to the
  25259 27.18%:  would like to go to the library
  25260 11.06%:  would like to go to the funeral

  25267 5.40%:  would like to go to the theatre
  25268 5.05%:  need to write a book about this alone
  25269 5.05%:  think you just created the answer for
  25270 5.05%:  need to figure out what the actual
  25271 41.35%:  need to figure out what the actual science
  25272 7.71%:  need to figure out what the actual science on
  25273 5.05%:  think we just figured out reason three
  25274 5.05%:  think you just rewrote the rules on life
  25275 5.05%:  can totally see that being done for the
  25276 5.05%:  think you just found the real answer to real
  25277 5.05%:  feel like you just shot down a lot
  25278 5.05%:  can totally see that working if the
  25279 5.04%:  already know enough about science to burst forth
  25280 5.04%:  really need to write a book on this subject to clar
  25281 5.04%:  think you just found a new article
  25282 5.04%:  think you just won the entire debate league!!
  25283 5.04%:  always thought it could be sent
  25284 5.04%:  need to write a book about this author!!
  25285 5.04%:  think we just figured out a reason not to care
  25286 5.04%:  feel like there should be a noise
  25287 5.04%:  can totally see this working for real
  25288 5.04%:  just thought of an entire new area
  25289 5.04%:  think the science world just got 
  25290 5.04%:  feel like you could write
  25291 12.16%:  feel like you could write that on
  25292 5.93%:  feel like you could write that on the
  25293 5.06%:  feel like you could write that better

  25296 5.04%:  would like to be the first one to say out
  25297 5.04%:  guess it could be that
  25298 5.04%:  could totally write a book about these genius
  25299 5.04%:  feel like you just threw the science
  25300 5.04%:  really need to think about this longer to be
  25301 10.69%:  really need to think about this longer to be sure!!
  25302 5.04%:  think you need to get that in
  25303 5.04%:  think you just blew all our science bro
  25304 5.04%:  just totally thought
  25305 21.39%:  just totally thought of dark
  25306 9.73%:  just totally thought of a
  25307 9.51%:  just totally thought of science

  25321 5.04%:  need to think about this answer after
  25322 5.04%:  think we just found the one real secret
  25323 8.70%:  think we just found the one real secret about
  25324 5.04%:  really think that could be our first
  25325 5.04%:  forgot about that second reason
  25326 5.04%:  really need to figure out how to be there
  25327 5.04%:  think science
  25328 62.01%:  think science just got

  25443 5.05%:  think science just changed before
  25444 5.04%:  think you just won the logic battle round for
  25445 5.04%:  need to talk to you later about being less
  25446 5.04%:  need to go write a science story
  25447 49.38%:  need to go write a science story about
  25448 5.04%:  feel like there should be a button to
  25449 5.03%:  think you are correct about the last
  25450 7.65%:  think you are correct about the last one
  25451 5.84%:  think you are correct about the last one!!
  25452 5.03%:  need to tell the science writers about you
  25453 5.03%:  like this story better where
  25454 5.03%:  really need to write about this because the
  25455 5.03%:  need to get to work on this because holy
  25456 5.03%:  was totally right there and
  25457 5.03%:  forgot to include that because there are like 
  25458 5.03%:  could totally write a book series about teen
  25459 5.03%:  think you just hit on actual
  25460 5.05%:  think you just hit on actual real
  25461 5.03%:  like that ending better because now you
  25462 5.03%:  think we just created a theory about science!!
  25463 5.03%:  was just trying to think of counter
  25464 5.03%:  feel like this could be a new theory to
  25465 5.03%:  really need to learn about those
  25466 47.45%:  really need to learn about those things
  25467 41.21%:  really need to learn about those things before
  25468 16.88%:  really need to learn about those things!!
  25469 5.24%:  really need to learn about those other
  25470 5.03%:  gotta write a book about this fr
  25471 5.03%:  forgot to include that because then we
  25472 5.03%:  really need to write a book on this subject at
  25473 10.79%:  really need to write a book on this subject at once
  25474 6.56%:  really need to write a book on this subject at once!!
  25475 5.03%:  think that just earned you a science lecture!!
  25476 5.03%:  think we just figured out the only real reason a
  25477 5.03%:  feel like science just got one
  25478 5.03%:  should write a book about these giant reject
  25479 5.03%:  forgot about that because this
  25480 5.03%:  really need to look into this at
  25481 11.34%:  really need to look into this at once
  25482 28.28%:  really need to look into this at once because

  25489 11.23%:  think you just won the debate for actual science!!
  25490 5.03%:  think we finally got
  25491 5.03%:  really should know about science better but
  25492 5.03%:  need to start working on that because
  25493 5.03%:  really need to get back into science just for
  25494 5.03%:  like your ideas better now than before so that

  25515 5.03%:  could totally see that being in one of these
  25516 5.03%:  need to write a science book real fast to counter
  25517 5.03%:  need to write a book about these giants before lunch
  25518 5.03%:  need to get back to science sooner!!
  25519 5.02%:  really need to check that website

  25526 5.02%:  need to figure out how to talk this
  25527 5.02%:  totally just learned about science right now bro
  25528 5.02%:  think you need to be careful about those giant
  25529 5.02%:  could totally see that being in a screen
  25530 5.02%:  think you just rewrote the entire con
  25531 5.02%:  just figured out the answer to like 
  25532 5.02%:  feel like that would be the case

  25534 5.02%:  feel like the only answer to that is to go on
  25535 5.02%:  think we found the secret to being actual
  25536 5.02%:  think you just blew our last chance to be cool at
  25537 5.02%:  think we should go tell science about our
  25538 5.02%:  think we just found a really cool
  25539 5.51%:  think we just found a really cool science
  25540 5.02%:  totally just thought of a new and
  25541 5.02%:  already know enough about science to be so
  25542 5.02%:  need to write a book about these flying al
  25543 5.02%:  really need to think of better re
  25544 5.02%:  cannot begin to tell you how start
  25545 5.02%:  think we found the reason you got

  25588 8.07%:  guess that could account for a little
  25589 7.28%:  guess that could account for a tiny
  25590 5.02%:  need to figure out a way to use these
  25591 5.01%:  think we just found the real you
  25592 5.01%:  like that better than any science
  25593 5.01%:  need to think about this for a cou
  25594 5.01%:  would like to go to this
  25595 5.01%:  think that could be a real life
  25596 5.01%:  should totally write a book about these nice
  25597 5.01%:  really need to think about that one for serious
  25598 5.01%:  really need to write that book soon because then
  25599 5.01%:  already know this is the
  25600 47.99%:  already know this is the correct
  25601 5.01%:  feel like this theory could be a
  25602 5.01%:  need to get on that theory like a
  25603 5.01%:  really need to figure out a better case
  25604 5.01%:  think we just found a really cool reason
  25605 5.01%:  feel like the answer is no but you
  25606 5.01%:  need to figure out how to tell jokes
  25607 5.01%:  think you just ruined all the secret cool
  25608 5.01%:  think we just created a totally
  25609 5.01%:  think we just figured out the reason to colon
  25610 5.01%:  think the correct word
  25611 5.01%:  really need to look into this before there
  25612 5.01%:  think we just totally found the real
  25613 48.50%:  think we just totally found the real reason
  25614 7.97%:  think we just totally found the real science
  25615 5.01%:  forgot to include that because it only
  25616 59.86%:  forgot to include that because it only works
  25617 5.01%:  forgot about that because the only
  25618 5.01%:  really need to look into that one with
  25619 5.01%:  think that could be our first great
  25620 5.01%:  just thought of a new science to call
  25621 5.01%:  think we just found the entire rest
  25622 5.01%:  thought you were serious back
  25623 5.01%:  think we just figured out the real reason on
  25624 5.01%:  think science just got really cool for the
  25625 5.01%:  think we just found the true reason al
  25626 5.01%:  think you just got the coolest idea for new
  25627 5.01%:  really need to get on that book about science!!
  25628 5.01%:  need to write a story about this alone
  25629 5.01%:  think you just created another science!!
  25630 5.01%:  really need to get out of this kitchen because
  25631 5.01%:  think you just blew science out of the corner
  25632 5.01%:  just thought of a billion ways to turn dark
  25633 5.01%:  like that theory because it turns our
  25634 5.01%:  would like to be the last to hear about science
  25635 5.01%:  should write a book about those gi
  25636 5.01%:  just got the best idea for a theory book
  25637 5.01%:  need to get on this before the
  25638 5.01%:  need to talk to you after science
  25639 5.95%:  need to talk to you after science hour
  25640 5.01%:  think we just found the cutting
  25641 5.01%:  really need to think about this one too
  25642 5.95%:  really need to think about this one too because
  25643 5.01%:  really need to work on science before this
  25644 5.00%:  think you should write letters about
  25645 5.00%:  need to think about this for years but
  25646 5.00%:  would like to assure
  25647 37.29%:  would like to assure you that there

  25671 5.00%:  think we just learned about the secret of all
  25672 5.00%:  should write a book about these little bug
  25673 5.00%:  thought you were a science bro and not a bro
  25674 5.00%:  thought you were all science bro
  25675 26.42%:  thought you were all science bros around

  25683 8.65%:  need to write a book to collect these
  25684 5.00%:  already know enough about this science to rule
  25685 5.00%:  think you should be canon
  25686 5.00%:  need science to figure that one
  25687 18.65%:  need science to figure that one out!!
  25688 13.06%:  need science to figure that one out real
  25689 5.00%:  need to write a book about this because then only
  25690 5.00%:  would like to be the first guy to lose
  25691 5.00%:  really need to start looking for jobs with
  25692 5.00%:  really need to figure out what that joke is sooner
  25693 5.00%:  need to figure out what color
  25694 9.95%:  need to figure out what color that
  25695 73.22%:  need to figure out what color that is because
  25696 6.80%:  need to figure out what color that is so

  25698 5.56%:  need to figure out what color that is!!
  25699 5.52%:  need to figure out what color those
  25700 5.46%:  need to figure out what color their
  25701 5.00%:  really need to look into that now because there is
  25702 5.00%:  think you just ruined that secret
  25703 5.00%:  really should get on
  25704 23.14%:  really should get on that science
  25705 29.09%:  really should get on that science train
  25706 28.86%:  really should get on that science train before
  25707 12.31%:  really should get on this
  25708 10.49%:  really should get on that sooner

  25713 10.89%:  really need to write a book soon because it
  25714 7.24%:  really need to write a book soon because then
  25715 5.19%:  really need to write a book soon because if
  25716 5.00%:  already know enough about this subject not to feel
  25717 5.00%:  really need to check this out now because
  25718 5.00%:  can see how that could be a source
  25719 16.29%:  can see how that could be a source of energy
  25720 6.19%:  can see how that could be a source of energy!!
  25721 5.00%:  can totally see that working out in such
  25722 5.00%:  need to write a book about the one true

  25728 34.53%:  need to get on this sooner rather
  25729 5.00%:  think that sounds really boring to
  25730 5.00%:  think that would count as genius
  25731 4.99%:  think we just figured out the reason to be a
  25732 4.99%:  should write a book about this to get all
  25733 4.99%:  need to tell science about that because holy fr
  25734 4.99%:  thought you were a real adult
  25735 4.99%:  cannot begin to tell you how credible those are!!
  25736 4.99%:  need to talk to you right now because our brains
  25737 4.99%:  was just about to be really
  25738 4.99%:  need to think about this one because your
  25739 4.99%:  think we just learned about science too late for you!!
  25740 4.99%:  need to figure out a way to sell this book!!
  25741 4.99%:  just totally figured out how to be a
  25742 6.56%:  just totally figured out how to be a science

  25748 4.99%:  wanna
  25749 4.99%:  think this could be our last real
  25750 4.99%:  guess they are
  25751 271.20%:  guess they are real after
  25752 49.29%:  guess they are real then
  25753 27.83%:  guess they are real then!!
  25754 27.57%:  guess they are real and
  25755 10.70%:  guess they are real and we
  25756 9.65%:  guess they are real!!
  25757 8.18%:  guess they are real but
  25758 4.99%:  guess they could be real but then we can
  25759 4.99%:  need to talk to you about all this science
  25760 4.99%:  would argue that is the only
  25761 14.61%:  would argue that is the only reason
  25762 4.99%:  feel like you should be wearing a c
  25763 4.99%:  need to go back to the library with
  25764 4.99%:  can barely breathe!!
  25765 4.99%:  feel like the answer to that could be no
  25766 12.31%:  feel like the answer to that could be no but
  25767 4.99%:  thought it was fake
  25768 41.10%:  thought it was fake because
  25769 28.88%:  thought it was fake because nobody
  25770 26.41%:  thought it was fake because it couldn
  25771 12.89%:  thought it was fake too
  25772 11.47%:  thought it was fake too!!
  25773 5.55%:  thought it was fake too but
  25774 4.99%:  need to figure out how to store
  25775 4.99%:  would like to be the first one to say ut
  25776 4.99%:  really need to write that book soon because right
  25777 4.99%:  need to write that book soon
  25778 4.99%:  really need to figure out what science can
  25779 4.99%:  already know enough about science to be fore
  25780 4.98%:  can totally see that working for the science d
  25781 4.98%:  really need to write a book for this
  25782 5.81%:  really need to write a book for this because
  25783 4.98%:  cannot think of a better way to hide
  25784 4.98%:  thought of dark
  25785 4.98%:  would like this theory to be true so fr
  25786 4.98%:  would like to correct the history
  25787 4.98%:  need to go think about the science
  25788 4.98%:  really need to figure out when
  25789 4.98%:  like that theory and also
  25790 4.98%:  really need to figure out how to steal this joke!!
  25791 4.98%:  would like to see the science you brought to bear
  25792 4.98%:  need to talk to you alone about this in 
  25793 4.98%:  think you just blew science out of the d
  25794 8.89%:  think you just blew science out of the dang ball
  25795 4.98%:  really need to figure out science soon
  25796 4.98%:  think that sounds great
  25797 4.98%:  totally need to figure out science real
  25798 4.98%:  think you just found the secret to being a real ball
  25799 4.98%:  feel like that could be true because why
  25800 4.98%:  need to write a story about fake things
  25801 4.98%:  think you just won the science debate league for
  25802 4.98%:  think you should be a real
  25803 4.98%:  think you just rewrote all the rules of being!!
  25804 4.98%:  already know enough science about this to be
  25805 4.98%:  think we should call our
  25806 32.57%:  think we should call our science
  25807 4.98%:  think you found the secret to a career in ast
  25808 4.98%:  wonder if there are
  25809 9.49%:  wonder if there are any science

  27678 5.67%:  need to learn about this because
  27679 5.64%:  need to learn about science because you
  27680 5.05%:  need to learn about science really
  27681 4.97%:  feel like you just changed the entire color
  27682 4.97%:  thought you were a science based
  27683 4.97%:  hate to break it to you but our science needs a
  27684 4.97%:  need to talk to science about what
  27685 14.48%:  need to talk to science about what you
  27686 4.97%:  would like that to be true if only because the one
  27687 4.97%:  can totally see how that could benefit
  27688 5.39%:  can totally see how that could benefit our
  27689 4.97%:  feel like you just watched science
  27690 4.97%:  need to go back to the library to learn science!!

  27695 4.97%:  would like to see your source on the
  27696 4.96%:  thought you were real science friends but
  27697 4.96%:  should totally write that fan science
  27698 4.96%:  need to get to the library to follow
  27699 4.96%:  should write a book about all the gi
  27700 4.96%:  hate to be the bearer of really good news on
  27701 4.96%:  think we just found the reason actual gi
  27702 4.96%:  guess that theory could be true too!!
  27703 4.96%:  was just about to include
  27704 4.96%:  really should know better than to get an
  27705 4.96%:  think that could be legit!!
  27706 4.96%:  need to think about this one later because you
  27707 4.96%:  think you just wrote an actual good sc
  27708 4.96%:  think that is a
  27709 9.77%:  think that is a totally
  27710 5.64%:  think that is a great
  27711 5.28%:  think that is a really
  27712 4.96%:  really should write a book about science bro
  27713 4.96%:  think you just blew all of science and the
  27714 4.96%:  would like to be the first one to rule these
  27715 4.96%:  should write this book!!
  27716 4.96%:  guess that could account for why
  27717 4.96%:  really need to learn about the science of shit
  27718 4.96%:  hate to be the one to burst your idea of science
  27719 4.96%:  would argue that is the first
  27720 4.96%:  think you just blew our last chance to create
  27721 4.96%:  need to think about this because now all bet
  27722 4.96%:  think we just found the true reason to be
  27723 4.96%:  need to write an article about theory
  27724 4.96%:  need to go write about this for the
  27725 4.96%:  need to figure out how to access that library
  27726 4.96%:  need to write a book about the science of strange
  27727 4.96%:  hate to break it to you bro but science has found
  27728 4.96%:  think we just found the secret to regular
  27729 4.96%:  think you just won the debate for being
  27730 4.96%:  like that theory because it could be real but we
  27731 4.96%:  really need to start looking into how these
  27732 4.96%:  really think we just figured out a better
  27733 4.96%:  think you just won the science race for our
  27734 4.96%:  think you just created one of the best gi
  27735 4.96%:  would like that to be true if only because then as
  27736 4.96%:  really should start working
  27737 8.60%:  really should start working out
  27738 7.76%:  really should start working on that
  27739 6.80%:  really should start working on a

  27744 4.96%:  just figured out what all science
  27745 4.96%:  need to talk to you right after lunch because we
  27746 4.96%:  think that could be our new reality!!
  27747 4.96%:  kinda want this to be true because of your
  27748 4.96%:  think you just stole the entire
  27749 4.96%:  would like to clarify that not
  27750 4.96%:  really need to think about this before we close out
  27751 4.96%:  guess they are real then and
  27752 4.96%:  need to talk to the science guys about fr
  27753 4.96%:  thought we could talk about it!!
  27754 4.95%:  need to talk about this before
  27755 10.53%:  need to talk about this before anyone
  27756 27.95%:  need to talk about this before anyone else!!
  27757 4.95%:  hate to break it to you but being a
  27758 4.95%:  think we just found the real reason to call
  27759 4.95%:  could totally see that being the cause of non
  27760 4.95%:  think we just created the science for our
  27761 4.95%:  really need to get better answers
  27762 5.27%:  really need to get better answers than
  27763 4.95%:  think you figured out another secret to
  27764 4.95%:  would like to get
  27765 4.95%:  think you just altered the balance of science!!
  27766 4.95%:  need to tell this theory to a science blog
  27767 4.95%:  should write that science book!!
  27768 4.95%:  would be totally into this!!
  27769 4.95%:  would like to say that if these
  27770 4.95%:  think you just created an answer for
  27771 10.53%:  think you just created an answer for the
  27772 4.95%:  think we just found the secret to buying
  27773 4.95%:  could totally write a science book that goes
  27774 4.95%:  would like that to be true enough to be a reason
  27775 4.95%:  think you just threw out a good reason
  27776 4.95%:  just thought of an idea better
  27777 4.95%:  really should write about that one
  27778 4.95%:  would like to hear this fantasy
  27779 4.95%:  would like to say that the entire
  27780 8.45%:  would like to say that the entire reason
  27781 4.95%:  would say that there
  27782 4.95%:  think we just found the reason you are better
  27783 4.95%:  feel like that needs to be written on a ch
  27784 4.95%:  need to get back to you on this because we
  27785 4.95%:  gotta write a science book real
  27786 4.95%:  just thought of a brand new science to talk
  27787 4.95%:  can see how that could be easily
  27788 4.95%:  forgot to check that last one because we
  27789 4.95%:  can totally see this being real!!
  27790 4.95%:  would like to listen to the
  27791 11.51%:  would like to listen to the rest of your her
  27792 5.21%:  would like to listen to the rest of you
  27793 4.95%:  just figured out the real theory
  27794 4.95%:  was just about to go on about their
  27795 4.95%:  need to go back to the library because of how
  27796 5.69%:  need to go back to the library because of how intense
  27797 4.95%:  feel like you just brought science to an
  27798 4.95%:  think you should just tell
  27799 4.94%:  feel like there should be a cartoon to
  27800 4.94%:  think you should get an actual science job before
  27801 4.94%:  hate to break it to you but no one else
  27802 22.17%:  hate to break it to you but no one else cares
  27803 11.09%:  hate to break it to you but no one else has

  27806 5.13%:  hate to break it to you but no one else cares!!
  27807 4.94%:  was just about to thank you for dining
  27808 4.94%:  need to get to the library because how

  27810 5.43%:  think that could be your best case for giant bro
  27811 4.94%:  thought you were just like
  27812 4.94%:  need to go think about this now because all bet
  27813 4.94%:  need to get back to this later because if
  27814 4.94%:  hate to break it to you but science has long before
  27815 4.94%:  need to write that science book so
  27816 4.94%:  was just about to call you boring for
  27817 4.94%:  can totally see that being the source of our new
  27818 4.94%:  really need to check into that soon
  27819 7.12%:  really need to check into that soon because
  27820 4.94%:  thought you liked science better

  27822 9.88%:  need to talk to you alone about the science
  27823 4.94%:  think you just wrote the end to science
  27824 4.94%:  think we just figured out eternal eternal
  27825 4.94%:  think we just learned about that on
  27826 4.94%:  feel like you just changed the entire actual
  27827 4.94%:  need to check into that one!!

  27840 4.94%:  would like to note that if anyone else

  27842 15.13%:  need to write a book for science about that
  27843 8.32%:  need to write a book for science about that!!
  27844 4.93%:  need to write about that in a book so
  27845 4.93%:  just totally thought of a reason
  27846 4.93%:  just thought of a new story called
  27847 4.93%:  need to get to the library before it closes an
  27848 4.93%:  need to go think about this one real fast
  27849 4.93%:  think you just ruined the last front
  27850 4.93%:  think you should be our new science la

  27852 4.93%:  hate to break it to you but science has now ruled
  27853 4.93%:  need to think about science
  27854 4.93%:  need to figure out where you think
  27855 4.93%:  think science just found out there
  27856 4.93%:  think you just blew science out of the can
  27857 4.93%:  need to talk to you about life choices but
  27858 4.93%:  thought you were an actual doctor

  27861 11.69%:  would like that to be the case but only for science
  27862 4.93%:  think we just found the secret to your long

  27870 7.06%:  need to go think about all of this real
  27871 5.30%:  need to go think about all of that
  27872 4.93%:  need to figure out how to ask

  27874 10.33%:  guess you could check that
  27875 11.29%:  guess you could check that one
  27876 5.07%:  guess you could check for
  27877 4.93%:  cannot begin to tell you just how racist
  27878 4.93%:  already know enough about science to be the first to be
  27879 4.93%:  like that ending best of all because you
  27880 4.93%:  was about to call
  27881 4.93%:  like your ideas better than usual!!
  27882 4.93%:  totally forgot about this because we
  27883 4.93%:  feel like science just got way harder than

  27885 4.93%:  would like that to be the case for just
  27886 4.93%:  think you found the secret to being secret!!

  27903 9.16%:  think you figured out all the reasons to
  27904 5.23%:  think you figured out all the secret

  27906 6.25%:  really need to look into that now because if there
  27907 4.93%:  can totally see that being used to win
  27908 4.93%:  think you just shot down an
  27909 4.93%:  need to get on this theory now
  27910 5.03%:  need to get on this theory now because
  27911 4.93%:  already know enough about science to tell such
  27912 4.92%:  would like to see your science teacher about that bro
  27913 4.92%:  was just about to check out for today!!
  27914 4.92%:  feel like you just turned the last
  27915 12.04%:  feel like you just turned the last three

  27928 4.92%:  feel like that should be an instant
  27929 4.92%:  cannot breathe right now because you fucked
  27930 4.92%:  like that theory because it leads
  27931 4.92%:  would like that to be the case only because fr

  27942 4.92%:  think you need to be alone for a while to get
  27943 4.92%:  like this theory because no
  27944 16.66%:  like this theory because no one can
  27945 13.20%:  like this theory because no one would
  27946 8.94%:  like this theory because no one could
  27947 5.45%:  like this theory because no one can argue

  27952 4.92%:  just got the idea that
  27953 4.92%:  think you should go write a
  27954 4.92%:  think we should call science to
  27955 4.92%:  need to figure out what those
  27956 11.89%:  need to figure out what those are
  27957 8.57%:  need to figure out what those are because
  27958 4.92%:  totally thought it

  27961 14.59%:  totally thought it was like
  27962 13.40%:  totally thought it was black
  27963 9.18%:  totally thought it was because
  27964 7.65%:  totally thought it was because of
  27965 5.00%:  totally thought it would
  27966 15.28%:  totally thought it would be easier

  27969 4.92%:  need to go think about this for real because now
  27970 4.92%:  would like that theory to be true so fr
  27971 4.92%:  think you need to call science before
  27972 4.92%:  think that could be true because of
  27973 4.92%:  should write a book about it because they
  27974 4.92%:  need to figure out a way to check this sooner
  27975 4.92%:  cannot think of a better theory as
  27976 4.92%:  think we just figured out the reason not all
  27977 4.92%:  would like this to be true but there are
  27978 4.92%:  hate to be the one to burst your blind
  27979 4.92%:  feel like this has been an
  27980 4.91%:  like this new theory better but also
  27981 4.91%:  think we just figured out the only reason to be cel
  27982 4.91%:  think you need to get those
  27983 4.91%:  hate to break it to you but our beliefs
  27984 4.91%:  need to write a book about this so clearly
  27985 4.91%:  hate to break it to you but science showed
  27986 4.91%:  should write a book about giants to tell
  27987 4.91%:  need to think about this for real real long!!
  27988 4.91%:  think you just found the answer to a larger
  27989 4.91%:  need to think about this so clearly

  28188 4.89%:  know nothing about the actual subject
  28189 4.89%:  need to start looking at the science of
  28190 4.88%:  thought you were kinda cute before!!
  28191 4.88%:  feel like that could be the best way to use
  28192 4.88%:  really need to get that book

  28206 4.88%:  need to go back to the library because who
  28207 4.88%:  really think that could be our answer!!

  28209 4.88%:  should really
  28210 17.19%:  should really write
  28211 27.98%:  should really write that book
  28212 26.12%:  should really write this

  28231 6.43%:  should really start writing about
  28232 5.02%:  should really watch
  28233 4.88%:  feel like that could be the correct answer too!!

  28267 4.87%:  think you just changed science to be better for
  28268 4.87%:  forgot to include that last one because we
  28269 4.87%:  forgot about that because then
  28270 4.87%:  need to get on that science bullet
  28271 4.87%:  think that sounds way cool

  28361 4.86%:  really need to take this
  28362 4.86%:  need to write a book about this alone!!
  28363 4.86%:  really need to figure out how to cancel the
  28364 4.86%:  think you just won the science detect
  28365 4.86%:  think you just found a real answer
  28366 4.86%:  need to think about that serious
  28367 4.86%:  feel like you just used the
  28368 4.86%:  need to get out of here because all that
  28369 4.86%:  just found out that there are
  28370 4.86%:  need to talk to science about this one before
  28371 4.86%:  need to go think about that on
  28372 4.86%:  like this theory and want to see
  28373 4.86%:  think you just found the real reason we got to
  28374 4.86%:  think we found the secret to science baby
  28375 4.86%:  think you just changed science for a lot
  28376 4.86%:  need to go write about this before anyone be
  28377 4.86%:  should write a book about this battle
  28378 4.86%:  think you just created real life ghost
  28379 4.86%:  can see how that could be true for sure
  28380 4.86%:  need to figure out how to retro
  28381 4.86%:  think you found the reason we built
  28382 4.86%:  really should know better than to argue science f
  28383 4.86%:  really need to figure out how to teach science at
  28384 4.86%:  really need to figure out how to cancel that
  28385 4.86%:  could totally see that being worth
  28386 4.86%:  really need to get out of this chair because now

  28391 13.75%:  think we just totally changed our current
  28392 11.94%:  think we just totally changed our beliefs
  28393 4.86%:  need to think about this now fr
  28394 4.86%:  can totally get behind that in
  28395 4.86%:  feel like this theory could be onto
  28396 4.86%:  just thought of a way to be cool and
  28397 10.93%:  just thought of a way to be cool and science
  28398 5.26%:  just thought of a way to be cool and still
  28399 4.86%:  need to write about that before science ru
  28400 4.85%:  could totally see that working in the near
  28401 4.85%:  feel like this could be another case
  28402 4.85%:  was gonna ask you for
  28403 4.85%:  think that could be a real winner!!

  28536 4.85%:  should write a book about the strange
  28537 4.85%:  totally need to write a science book just
  28538 4.85%:  hate to be the one to bring you bad
  28539 4.85%:  think you just won the science club debate of
  28540 4.85%:  would like to see your science grant
  28541 4.85%:  guess that theory could work for
  28542 4.85%:  feel like that would be a great science
  28543 5.31%:  feel like that would be a great science story
  28544 4.85%:  need to write a book about this for real but
  28545 4.85%:  should write a book about the science you
  28546 6.13%:  should write a book about the science you can
  28547 4.85%:  need to talk to this guy about his career
  28548 4.85%:  need to get to the library faster so
  28549 4.85%:  really need to figure out how to track this
  28550 4.85%:  just thought of science!!
  28551 4.85%:  think we just found out the entire cos
  28552 4.85%:  think we need to figure out that
  28553 15.17%:  think we need to figure out that one
  28554 14.22%:  think we need to figure out that one real
  28555 6.54%:  think we need to figure out that one!!

  28559 4.84%:  need to talk to you about this bro
  28560 4.84%:  really thought we talked about science too
  28561 4.84%:  think we just created the coolest non
  28562 4.84%:  really need to look into this further cause
  28563 4.84%:  feel like you just brought down the entire central
  28564 4.84%:  really need to work on being better able

  28566 4.84%:  really need to figure out how to share in on
  28567 4.84%:  really need to think about where science
  28568 4.84%:  really need to think about that before ruling
  28569 4.84%:  need to think about this for way longer lol
  28570 4.84%:  think that totally sol
  28571 4.84%:  like this theory best of all and want to be
  28572 4.84%:  think we just found out the secret alien
  28573 6.52%:  think we just found out the secret alien race
  28574 4.84%:  need to think about all the ways in
  28575 4.84%:  thought you wanted to be serious for like

  28577 4.84%:  would like to be the first ghost to be
  28578 4.84%:  think we just created a science theory out of our
  28579 4.84%:  like that theory because it connect
  28580 4.84%:  need to write that short
  28581 4.84%:  need to write a story right the
  28582 4.84%:  hate to be the one to tell our science bud
  28583 4.84%:  think you just screwed that
  28584 4.84%:  just got the best idea for a book where you can turn
  28585 4.84%:  really need to figure out how to not breathe
  28586 4.84%:  like this theory about as
  28587 4.84%:  really need to think about how often
  28588 4.84%:  need to figure out a way to ensure that no
  28589 4.84%:  would like to hear nothing else on
  28590 4.84%:  guess that could totally be a
  28591 4.84%:  would like to be the first guy to rule
  28592 4.84%:  need to think about this later because energy
  28593 4.84%:  need to go think about this alone for a w
  28594 4.84%:  like that theory a lot and
  28595 4.84%:  think you just rewrote all of science to change
  28596 4.84%:  would like to say that before hearing
  28597 4.84%:  hate to break it to you bro but all science needs
  28598 4.84%:  just figured out how to create the
  28599 4.84%:  could totally see that working because if there
  28600 4.84%:  think we should be careful not to be too science
  28601 4.84%:  need to figure out how to eat this because
  28602 4.84%:  think we just learned the true source of all
  28603 4.84%:  really need to write a book about this then
  28604 4.84%:  would argue that this is better
  28605 4.83%:  think you just created a reason to go to
  28606 4.83%:  think you just blew our last chance to be alone!!
  28607 4.83%:  would like to see your article on that because then
  28608 4.83%:  really need to figure out how to clone this
  28609 4.83%:  really should write a book about nothing
  28610 6.69%:  really should write a book about nothing but
  28611 4.83%:  hate to break it to your face but science doesn
  28612 4.83%:  need to talk to this science teacher alone
  28613 4.83%:  think we just un
  28614 4.83%:  think you just got the idea of a
  28615 4.83%:  would like to note that science
  28616 7.68%:  would like to note that science has
  28617 9.71%:  would like to note that science has been
  28618 4.83%:  think you just found the real giant
  28619 4.83%:  hate to break it to you but science has found no
  28620 4.83%:  need to think about this larger
  28621 4.83%:  need to figure out a way to check this out on
  28622 4.83%:  should write a book about it before that
  28623 4.83%:  think you just earned another letter
  28624 4.83%:  really need to talk about this sooner before it
  28625 4.83%:  feel like that could be your
  28626 7.97%:  feel like that could be your best
  28627 8.44%:  feel like that could be your best chance
  28628 10.83%:  feel like that could be your best chance at being
  28629 6.67%:  feel like that could be your best answer
  28630 5.20%:  feel like that could be your thesis
  28631 4.83%:  think we should be careful not to lose
  28632 4.83%:  need to get on this book
  28633 4.83%:  need to figure out how to sell those
  28634 4.83%:  feel like that should warrant
  28635 4.83%:  hate to be the one to ruin all your ideas but no
  28636 4.83%:  forgot about that one earlier!!
  28637 4.83%:  can totally see that being our best
  28638 4.83%:  would like this theory to be true as
  28639 4.83%:  would like to be the one to say again
  28640 4.83%:  think you just raised the bar on all
  28641 4.83%:  really need to get back in touch with nature

  28650 4.83%:  think we just found out the real secret!!
  28651 4.83%:  should write a science book for real

  28653 14.77%:  hate to be the one to ruin a really good
  28654 14.99%:  hate to be the one to ruin a really good science
  28655 4.82%:  need to talk to you about this science bull
  28656 4.82%:  just got the best idea for a bunch
  28657 4.82%:  think we just figured out the only real reason to be able
  28658 4.82%:  just got the idea for the century!!

  28700 4.82%:  feel like that could be the correct answers
  28701 4.81%:  just thought of a way science can be done
  28702 6.86%:  just thought of a way science can be done better

  28758 4.81%:  would say that these
  28759 4.81%:  feel like science just went through a door to
  28760 4.81%:  like this theory better and also cannot
  28761 4.81%:  really need to get out of this house in
  28762 4.81%:  would like that theory to be true for
  28763 12.96%:  would like that theory to be true for science

  28816 4.80%:  need to write a book about all the secret flying
  28817 4.80%:  would like to be the first to lose
  28818 4.80%:  feel like that could be the worst reason to be
  28819 4.80%:  would like to note that there are reasons

  28863 4.79%:  hate to be the one to burst your double science
  28864 4.79%:  need to go think about this now fr
  28865 4.79%:  think you just blew our entire cos

  28869 36.91%:  can see where that could get you into trouble if
  28870 18.83%:  can see where that could get you into trouble in
  28871 4.90%:  can see where that could get you into trouble on
  28872 4.79%:  just figured out where all the science ner
  28873 4.79%:  would like that to be the case because it only conf
  28874 4.79%:  feel like you should just write a
  28875 4.79%:  can totally get on board with these bro

  28877 4.79%:  was just about to thank you for being hot
  28878 4.79%:  hate to break it to you but science has blown
  28879 4.79%:  think we just found the secret to all being
  28880 4.79%:  need to talk to this theory alone because
  28881 4.79%:  need to know about these
  28882 12.09%:  need to know about these things
  28883 11.58%:  need to know about these things before

  28908 4.78%:  like your ideas better now than before but just
  28909 4.78%:  need to write science books that
  28910 6.04%:  need to write science books that are really
  28911 4.78%:  think you just changed all our facts!!
  28912 4.78%:  think the answer to all our great
  28913 4.78%:  need to figure out a way to use science to back
  28914 4.78%:  would totally agree to
  28915 23.99%:  would totally agree to that!!
  28916 15.28%:  would totally agree to this

  28918 6.90%:  would totally agree to this because
  28919 6.79%:  would totally agree to this!!
  28920 6.27%:  would totally agree to this because then
  28921 4.84%:  would totally agree to this if
  28922 4.78%:  could totally see that being true because of how non
  28923 4.78%:  should totally be working on science rather
  28924 4.78%:  already know enough to be
  28925 4.78%:  need to write a book about this because non
  28926 4.78%:  could totally see that being science future
  28927 4.78%:  guess you could write that in a book to
  28928 4.78%:  really need to get on that thesis
  28929 4.78%:  really should get back to that

  28931 7.85%:  would like to be the first to rule out any chance
  28932 4.78%:  already know enough about this subject to be not
  28933 4.78%:  would like that to be true for reasons!!

  28940 7.24%:  guess they could be real if the entire
  28941 4.78%:  really need to figure out what the easiest
  28942 4.78%:  need to check that out because if
  28943 4.94%:  need to check that out because if true

  28947 4.78%:  think you just ruined one of the two last
  28948 4.78%:  think you just found the correct answer to a logical
  28949 4.78%:  feel like you just said that there
  28950 6.76%:  feel like you just said that there are
  28951 4.78%:  feel like that would count as an

  28976 4.77%:  need to figure out how to license these
  28977 4.77%:  feel like you just raised the chance
  28978 4.77%:  really think we should just be
  28979 4.77%:  totally just learned science right then
  28980 4.77%:  think you just learned about science too late bro
  28981 4.77%:  think the answer to all our life
  28982 4.77%:  need to start wearing clothes to
  28983 4.77%:  need to get out of the way because this joke

  28986 4.77%:  hate to be the one to ruin your grand
  28987 4.77%:  think we found tonight
  28988 4.77%:  think that just turned
  28989 5.14%:  think that just turned science
  28990 4.77%:  need to think about that before we can rule
  28991 4.77%:  really need to look into that because if so we
  28992 4.77%:  feel like you just changed the state

  29002 4.77%:  really need to think about this before we lose

  29036 4.76%:  think we just found a science teacher!!
  29037 4.76%:  need to figure out a way to be in
  29038 59.54%:  need to figure out a way to be in on that joke
  29039 19.76%:  need to figure out a way to be in on that joke!!

  29044 4.76%:  need to figure out a way to look at science
  29045 4.76%:  think we just found the secret to cancel
  29046 4.76%:  feel like you just ruined the one shot
  29047 4.76%:  need to think about this because for real now
  29048 4.76%:  can totally get behind this new future
  29049 4.76%:  like your idea better now than the one about our
  29050 4.76%:  could totally see that being true for a sec
  29051 4.76%:  would like that to be the case but only because non
  29052 4.76%:  should totally write books about it
  29053 4.76%:  think you just ruined a whole lot of careers
  29054 4.76%:  would like to say that last
  29055 5.50%:  would like to say that last thing
  29056 4.76%:  think we should be careful not to be racist to
  29057 4.75%:  think we just figured out all non
  29058 4.75%:  need to think about this longer before we all
  29059 4.75%:  can totally get on board with this for once
  29060 4.75%:  think you just beat the science debate!!
  29061 4.75%:  need to figure out a way to ruin
  29062 6.86%:  need to figure out a way to ruin that one
  29063 4.75%:  need to learn about science history real
  29064 4.75%:  think we just figured out a real reason they
  29065 4.75%:  need to write an entire book about you because

  29067 4.75%:  hate to break this to you but friend
  29068 4.75%:  should write a book about all these un
  29069 4.75%:  really need to look into that science because
  29070 4.75%:  should write that on a stick
  29071 4.75%:  would like to see your article on that subject once
  29072 4.75%:  need to write a book about this but change
  29073 4.75%:  can see how that could be a source of energy but
  29074 4.75%:  really should write better
  29075 13.79%:  really should write better science
  29076 4.75%:  was just about to look
  29077 13.95%:  was just about to look into
  29078 7.96%:  was just about to look into the
  29079 7.52%:  was just about to look that

  29081 4.75%:  think you just created the coolest new life
  29082 4.75%:  feel like you just changed our science
  29083 4.75%:  would like that to be the case for one single
  29084 4.75%:  think you just learned science for real!!
  29085 4.75%:  really should write that science book before
  29086 4.75%:  think we should be careful not to turn
  29087 4.75%:  hate to be the one to ruin a science break
  29088 4.75%:  need to talk to you about things!!
  29089 4.75%:  need to go think about that before you
  29090 9.58%:  need to go think about that before you ruin
  29091 4.75%:  need to talk to all the science guys now!!
  29092 4.75%:  like your idea better than how
  29093 4.75%:  think you figured out the secret to an
  29094 4.75%:  need to talk to you after the show because our
  29095 4.75%:  think we just had a great
  29096 4.75%:  need to get back to you on this before
  29097 9.31%:  need to get back to you on this before the
  29098 6.41%:  need to get back to you on this before science
  29099 4.75%:  feel like that theory could be wrong too because
  29100 4.75%:  really need to get on that science bro
  29101 4.75%:  like this theory better because no one can fact
  29102 4.75%:  just figured out another way to think
  29103 4.75%:  hate to be the one to ruin your life but we
  29104 4.75%:  feel like there should be a giant button
  29105 4.75%:  need to figure out a way to look that
  29106 4.75%:  forgot to write that one
  29107 4.75%:  need to figure out what colour these are so
  29108 4.75%:  should totally write a book about this r
  29109 4.75%:  think this could be our only answer
  29110 4.75%:  need to write an essay about it before
  29111 4.75%:  would be really into that being the case just for once

  29113 4.75%:  was just gonna eat lunch
  29114 6.79%:  was just gonna eat lunch but
  29115 4.75%:  just heard the
  29116 4.74%:  already know enough science to fill
  29117 4.74%:  really think we need to settle on this
  29118 4.74%:  need to get back to the library soon
  29119 11.75%:  need to get back to the library soon because
  29120 4.74%:  just learned about that theory like 
  29121 4.74%:  think we just found our secret to being
  29122 4.74%:  like your idea better than the one for
  29123 4.74%:  think you just wasted all
  29124 4.74%:  hate to be the one to say it and
  29125 4.74%:  can totally get on board this new
  29126 4.74%:  think we just found a real honest
  29127 4.74%:  hate to break this to you because we
  29128 4.74%:  could totally see that working because of the
  29129 4.74%:  think science just found a way to create
  29130 4.74%:  need to figure out how to steal all your science break
  29131 4.74%:  feel like you just got the better end
  29132 4.74%:  need to write a book about this before nature
  29133 4.74%:  need to think about this one before we get
  29134 4.74%:  need to figure out how to turn a
  29135 14.64%:  need to figure out how to turn a theory
  29136 20.44%:  need to figure out how to turn a theory like
  29137 4.74%:  forgot to include that one when
  29138 4.74%:  feel like this could be correct but
  29139 4.74%:  think you just created a real science where
  29140 4.74%:  would like to hear about this non
  29141 4.74%:  need to get back to the library because who
  29142 4.74%:  think you should get a license
  29143 14.43%:  think you should get a license before
  29144 6.46%:  think you should get a license to
  29145 4.74%:  really need to look into this before the news
  29146 4.74%:  really need to look further into the science just
  29147 4.74%:  should write a book about these not real
  29148 6.11%:  should write a book about these not real flying
  29149 4.74%:  was totally right and
  29150 4.74%:  hate to be the bearer of good news but you sure talk
  29151 4.74%:  need to talk to you about how there
  29152 6.66%:  need to talk to you about how there are
  29153 4.74%:  really should write a science book before the
  29154 4.74%:  need to figure out a way to hire
  29155 4.74%:  like that theory because it agrees
  29156 4.74%:  totally just learned about science the
  29157 4.74%:  already know enough about science for their
  29158 4.74%:  need to talk to you about other science
  29159 4.73%:  like your idea better now because of the cool
  29160 4.73%:  just thought of a brand new science career to
  29161 4.73%:  really need to get back to school so
  29162 4.73%:  need to write a book about the science of really
  29163 4.73%:  would like to be the first guy to see a
  29164 4.73%:  would like that to be correct because there
  29165 4.73%:  really need to think about that soon
  29166 4.73%:  can totally get behind that bro
  29167 27.18%:  can totally get behind that bro science
  29168 4.73%:  already know enough about science to see fl
  29169 4.73%:  feel like that theory is correct
  29170 4.73%:  cannot breathe right now because life just took
  29171 4.73%:  hate to be the bearer of good news but yours
  29172 4.73%:  think you should be on stage at
  29173 4.73%:  really need to get back to science later
  29174 4.73%:  think you just rewrote the canon
  29175 4.73%:  really think we just found a
  29176 4.73%:  really think we just found the coolest giant!!
  29177 4.73%:  think we just agreed
  29178 45.22%:  think we just agreed on the first
  29179 35.70%:  think we just agreed on the first real
  29180 10.65%:  think we just agreed on the best
  29181 9.58%:  think we just agreed on the first actual
  29182 8.38%:  think we just agreed that
  29183 8.04%:  think we just agreed on the correct
  29184 7.19%:  think we just agreed on the first really
  29185 8.42%:  think we just agreed on the first really cool
  29186 6.56%:  think we just agreed that science
  29187 5.02%:  think we just agreed on science
  29188 4.76%:  think we just agreed on science for
  29189 4.73%:  really need to look into this further because on
  29190 4.73%:  hate to break it to you bro but we don
  29191 4.73%:  would like to be the first one to see one
  29192 4.73%:  think we just changed our current beliefs
  29193 4.73%:  think we should be careful not to raise
  29194 7.87%:  think we should be careful not to raise your
  29195 4.73%:  think you just blew science bro
  29196 4.73%:  think you just wrote a better screen
  29197 4.73%:  guess that could account for like
  29198 4.73%:  think you just got there first and
  29199 5.36%:  think you just got there first and now
  29200 4.73%:  think we just figured out not only the real role
  29201 4.73%:  forgot about that theory because science blew
  29202 4.73%:  think you just blew a giant hole clean
  29203 4.73%:  think you just found the reason we all get to
  29204 4.73%:  just thought of a billion better
  29205 11.46%:  just thought of a billion better ways
  29206 6.93%:  just thought of a billion better ways dark
  29207 4.73%:  would like to hear the rest of your bat
  29208 4.73%:  need to figure out how to turn this ob
  29209 4.73%:  would like to see your notes for
  29210 8.26%:  would like to see your notes for that lecture

  29213 10.38%:  think you just hit on a reason for
  29214 4.73%:  think we just found our real calling
  29215 4.73%:  hate to break it to you but as long
  29216 4.73%:  need to write a book about this cos
  29217 4.73%:  need to tell this theory to science blog
  29218 4.73%:  think you just rewrote all of science here!!
  29219 4.73%:  guess that could be a real
  29220 4.73%:  just had the science
  29221 4.73%:  think you found the answer because
  29222 4.72%:  think you should be first on
  29223 4.72%:  was totally right before about their
  29224 4.72%:  think you just found the reason we call it
  29225 4.72%:  thought you were a science n
  29226 21.84%:  thought you were a science nerd but
  29227 14.24%:  thought you were a science nerd too

  29237 4.72%:  think we just changed our beliefs
  29238 4.72%:  need to tell the science guys about the
  29239 4.72%:  feel like that could be the correct answer in 
  29240 4.72%:  just got really
  29241 7.05%:  just got really scared
  29242 6.71%:  just got really scared there
  29243 5.03%:  just got really turned
  29244 6.09%:  just got really turned on there
  29245 5.42%:  just got really turned on!!
  29246 4.72%:  feel like this could be a story
  29247 4.72%:  just thought of a way to tell science
  29248 4.72%:  can totally see where this one
  29249 4.72%:  should write a science book for that one
  29250 4.72%:  need science to figure out how to tell you
  29251 4.72%:  think you just got shot down into
  29252 4.72%:  feel like we should be trying
  29253 36.28%:  feel like we should be trying to contact
  29254 20.79%:  feel like we should be trying to contact these bro

  29263 4.72%:  think you just changed our first
  29264 10.74%:  think you just changed our first contact
  29265 4.72%:  need to write a science book really fast to
  29266 4.72%:  already know enough science about the subject!!
  29267 4.72%:  could totally see that working out so
  29268 4.72%:  need to get on this theory now because it
  29269 4.72%:  already know enough science to rule out the first
  29270 4.72%:  can totally see how that could be object
  29271 4.72%:  would listen to that theory for science!!
  29272 4.72%:  would like that to be the case because cool
  29273 4.72%:  think that would be a totally
  29274 4.72%:  think we just found the secret to being your

  29278 4.72%:  think you found the secrets to
  29279 4.72%:  really need to figure out how to be less into
  29280 4.72%:  would listen to this theory for at
  29281 4.72%:  really need to talk to science writers
  29282 19.91%:  really need to talk to science writers about
  29283 4.72%:  think you just changed all our beliefs a
  29284 4.72%:  think we just found our best theory in
  29285 4.72%:  really need to get a
  29286 10.99%:  really need to get a better
  29287 8.22%:  really need to get a science

  29294 4.72%:  totally just learned about science now!!
  29295 4.72%:  like your ideas better than the one about us
  29296 4.72%:  need to write a book because that is the c
  29297 4.72%:  need to start calling this whole
  29298 4.72%:  really think we need to start science
  29299 4.72%:  forgot to check the current
  29300 4.72%:  should write books
  29301 20.35%:  should write books about
  29302 10.24%:  should write books about that
  29303 6.78%:  should write books about that!!
  29304 4.72%:  feel like we just got closer to an
  29305 4.72%:  need to think about this closely before agree
  29306 4.72%:  think we just found out the only correct
  29307 4.72%:  think we just found the reason you gotta
  29308 4.72%:  thought you were science bro
  29309 10.38%:  thought you were science bros!!
  29310 8.64%:  thought you were science bros before

  29348 4.71%:  really need to think about this one faster
  29349 4.71%:  just learned about this theory like 
  29350 4.71%:  would like to say that is not the
  29351 4.71%:  need to see that
  29352 4.80%:  need to see that theory
  29353 4.71%:  already know enough about this subject to con
  29354 4.71%:  think you just created the best alien race for
  29355 4.71%:  would like this to be real because
  29356 6.56%:  would like this to be real because then
  29357 4.71%:  need to know about this before this
  29358 4.71%:  forgot to include that because we
  29359 4.71%:  think science just found out that all
  29360 4.71%:  need to write about this all
  29361 4.71%:  need to get back to the library before it sh
  29362 4.71%:  like your ideas better when no

  29366 4.70%:  think we just found the last corner
  29367 4.70%:  need to figure out how to say this to
  29368 4.70%:  need to figure out what non

  29551 4.68%:  can totally see that being true while
  29552 4.68%:  already know enough about science but these
  29553 4.68%:  can totally see how the
  29554 5.57%:  can totally see how the science
  29555 4.68%:  was just about to take you to

  29680 4.66%:  need to know about this before tonight
  29681 12.78%:  need to know about this before tonight because
  29682 4.66%:  hate to be the one to be wrong about a science
  29683 4.66%:  thought we could finally be
  29684 4.66%:  need to figure out a way to tell those
  29685 11.15%:  need to figure out a way to tell those science
  29686 4.72%:  need to figure out a way to tell those science bro
