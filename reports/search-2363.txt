1.57%:  just figured out how to be a real science bro
1.56%:  need to go write a science book!!
1.56%:  just thought of a way to trick
1.56%:  just created a new theory of science out
1.55%:  thought you were fake but
1.55%:  feel like that would just
1.55%:  would like that theory to be real
1.55%:  think we found a
1.55%:  just got hit by a bullet of
7.82%:  just got hit by a bullet of science
3.00%:  just got hit by a bullet of science!!
2.08%:  just got hit by a bullet of science and
1.55%:  forgot all about the other
1.55%:  totally forgot there was science
1.98%:  totally forgot there was science behind
1.55%:  think we should tell
1.55%:  should write a science book to counter
2.26%:  should write a science book to counter that
1.75%:  should write a science book to counter that!!
1.55%:  really gotta
1.55%:  should totally write the
3.13%:  should totally write the book
1.55%:  think you just created science that
1.55%:  just called you out for talking science when
1.55%:  think you just won the debate for real science!!
1.55%:  kinda thought
3.53%:  kinda thought about
1.55%:  could totally be wrong about the science of this!!
1.54%:  think we just found a science that

1.48%:  think we should totally get
1.48%:  think you just bought a
1.48%:  think you just won the deb
1.48%:  just created a theory about
1.48%:  should write that book about

1.07%:  need to think about the
1.07%:  think you just won a science battle
1.07%:  need to go to the science library for the
1.07%:  just thought of science and now
1.07%:  just figured out how to talk science theory
1.07%:  could totally see that working on
1.07%:  thought you were a science bro and not

1.07%:  just thought of a way to take
1.07%:  forgot about science and
1.07%:  thought you said science
1.07%:  just found out there are other
1.07%:  forgot to think about all the ways science
1.07%:  think science has
1.07%:  just got hit by another science fact

0.98%:  forgot to think about how
0.98%:  need to go back to the future with
0.98%:  just got a new theory for black
0.98%:  could totally be right about the non
0.98%:  just figured out why there are no
1.46%:  just figured out why there are no black
0.98%:  think you just won the science race of our
0.98%:  could be talking about real science theory
0.98%:  could totally go with
1.24%:  could totally go with that!!
0.98%:  just figured out how to create a theory
0.98%:  think we should go tell
0.98%:  think you just altered the science
0.98%:  should write a science lecture book!!

0.97%:  just blew your science right out the roof!!
0.97%:  like that better!!
0.97%:  feel like science just got 
0.97%:  just had an org
0.97%:  could write a science book about those

0.97%:  could totally write a science book just about
0.97%:  would like to return to the subject of bro
0.97%:  just went through a
0.97%:  thought you cared about real science not
0.97%:  could be totally wrong about the first

1.41%:  think the world just got 
0.97%:  think that could be your
1.65%:  think that could be your best
0.97%:  could be totally wrong about science after
0.97%:  could be wrong about all the science just for the
0.97%:  should really get back to that
1.00%:  should really get back to that science
0.97%:  like how you just turned that
0.97%:  just figured out where all that black
0.97%:  could be wrong about the science here but also
0.97%:  really just figured out the whole science
0.97%:  forget how
0.97%:  would like to be a fly
6.98%:  would like to be a fly on that
0.97%:  think you just created science out
4.34%:  think you just created science out of whole
3.91%:  think you just created science out of nowhere

0.96%:  think you just got all of science down
0.96%:  feel like that would just be science
0.96%:  feel like science just got the
0.96%:  think we all just found science our
0.96%:  could be wrong about all these science
0.96%:  just thought of a way to trick science
0.96%:  need to start science
3.04%:  need to start science blog
0.96%:  think you forgot
0.96%:  thought science was about reject
0.96%:  just thought of a brand new science lecture
0.96%:  would totally go for that because then science
0.96%:  just figured out how to cheat science!!
0.96%:  think that could be our answer to
0.96%:  could write a science book just about that one
0.96%:  just figured out that all the science we
0.96%:  need to go write that science
0.96%:  could be wrong about the last one but
0.96%:  should totally write a book about the science!!
0.96%:  think you just got real science bro
0.96%:  totally just figured out what one
0.96%:  could be wrong here
1.01%:  could be wrong here but
0.96%:  could be wrong about the science here but at
0.96%:  like that theory best
0.96%:  think you should call science
2.31%:  think you should call science about
0.96%:  forgot you were a science bro until
4.16%:  forgot you were a science bro until just then

0.96%:  think we all just found science to
0.96%:  could totally be wrong about these other
0.96%:  need to figure out what you
0.96%:  could get into
1.22%:  could get into that!!
1.03%:  could get into that theory
0.96%:  think the science world just got an
0.96%:  will take that theory and
0.96%:  should write a science lecture book about
0.95%:  just figured out how to be real
0.95%:  was looking
2.17%:  was looking for that
0.97%:  was looking for the
0.95%:  totally just figured that one

2.29%:  thought you were cool before but
0.95%:  refuse to think about how long
0.95%:  should go write
17.66%:  should go write a book about that!!
2.27%:  should go write a science
2.76%:  should go write a science book
1.61%:  should go write that
3.39%:  should go write that book

0.95%:  just got hit by a truck!!
0.95%:  could totally be right about what
0.95%:  think you just changed real science to better
0.95%:  forgot about black holes and they
0.95%:  totally just learned about science

0.95%:  thought you were about science and facts
0.95%:  think we just found the great
0.95%:  thought you were still around!!
0.95%:  think you just beat science!!
0.95%:  kinda forgot about science
0.95%:  would like that to be the subject of our science
0.95%:  could be wrong about all of science but that theory
0.95%:  feel like the science world just got a bunch
0.95%:  just figured out how to attack
0.95%:  think science just got a whole lot real
0.95%:  should totally write that book for
2.72%:  should totally write that book for science
1.96%:  should totally write that book for science ner
0.95%:  could be wrong about all the science but it
0.95%:  just blew science out
0.94%:  totally just broke science through
0.94%:  just got really turned on there
0.94%:  think that would be science

0.94%:  always figured that
0.94%:  can totally see that working for the science bro
0.94%:  need to figure out how to use
1.73%:  need to figure out how to use that
1.04%:  need to figure out how to use science
0.94%:  could write books
12.72%:  could write books about that
15.31%:  could write books about that!!
5.16%:  could write books about that theory
10.11%:  could write books about that theory!!
1.31%:  could write books about the
2.95%:  could write books about the science
1.48%:  could write books about the science of that

0.94%:  feel like you just grabbed
0.94%:  could totally be on the
2.92%:  could totally be on the right
0.94%:  would like to close
0.94%:  just figured out how to look
0.94%:  should totally be the
1.70%:  should totally be the one to figure
0.94%:  think you just brought science to new
0.94%:  totally figured
1.31%:  totally figured out the
2.27%:  totally figured out the nature
1.13%:  totally figured out the answer
0.94%:  hate to burst your balloon there but
0.94%:  totally should write about
0.94%:  totally just won the science debate for our
0.94%:  just got called out on the science
0.94%:  just thought of a science book to
22.26%:  just thought of a science book to write called
1.40%:  just thought of a science book to write and
0.94%:  really need to get out of town
0.94%:  just thought of a better way science could kill
0.94%:  feel like you just changed both
6.86%:  feel like you just changed both science
2.57%:  feel like you just changed both our
0.94%:  feel like you just blew science out
0.94%:  totally forgot we could just
0.94%:  would totally be on
0.94%:  just got science hard on
0.94%:  just got turned on by science talk for
0.94%:  could be wrong about all of the science but this
0.94%:  think we found out about the
0.94%:  forgot about that while
0.94%:  think you just got all of the science!!
0.94%:  just thought of a brand new science lecture to
0.94%:  would like to say that that
0.93%:  could be wrong about the science but not the
0.93%:  totally just won the debate
0.93%:  think you just blew science out of all
0.93%:  think we all just heard
1.17%:  think we all just heard science
0.93%:  think you just blew science to
0.93%:  really need to talk to science about how
0.93%:  think you just changed all of our science!!
0.93%:  would like to forget
1.82%:  would like to forget that
1.60%:  would like to forget that you
1.12%:  would like to forget that just
0.93%:  could totally use
1.97%:  could totally use that for
1.29%:  could totally use that for a science
0.94%:  could totally use that for science
0.93%:  thought about it before but
0.93%:  totally just broke through science
0.97%:  totally just broke through science and
0.93%:  just thought of an idea!!
0.93%:  think science just got better for
0.93%:  think you just changed science 
0.93%:  just figured out what both science
0.93%:  would like to share
0.93%:  just got called out by a science bro who
0.93%:  would totally go to
0.93%:  think we just found out that all
1.42%:  think we just found out that all science
0.93%:  think you forgot to breathe
0.93%:  would really rather not be
0.93%:  totally just thought of a science word
0.93%:  just thought of a word
0.93%:  forgot all about that science!!
0.93%:  need to work on that theory for
3.38%:  need to work on that theory for science
1.22%:  need to work on that theory for science!!
0.93%:  totally forgot about those
0.93%:  forgot that you could
0.93%:  just figured out a way to be the
0.93%:  totally forgot about what
0.93%:  could be wrong about that for

0.93%:  just broke the world
0.93%:  really should get to
2.07%:  really should get to know
1.57%:  really should get to work

0.93%:  think science just got totally
0.92%:  would like to further
0.92%:  think you should go for
0.92%:  think you just won the bet!!
0.92%:  think you just created a whole science of
0.92%:  always forget about the other
0.92%:  could write a book about science that
0.92%:  just figured out how to relate
2.11%:  just figured out how to relate science
0.92%:  could be wrong about that one but
0.92%:  would like to be the last one
0.92%:  think you just brought science to bear and

0.92%:  really need to talk about this further
0.92%:  should totally write science fact book
0.92%:  think we just got real
2.36%:  think we just got real science
0.92%:  need to think about the science
0.92%:  totally should write a book of

0.92%:  need to think about that really
0.92%:  need to go to the science library to learn
0.92%:  totally just ruined science for the
2.50%:  totally just ruined science for the whole
0.92%:  like the sound of your science better than actual
0.92%:  just got yelled
2.37%:  just got yelled at for
2.24%:  just got yelled at for science
0.91%:  could write a science blog

0.91%:  just figured out a totally
0.91%:  could write a science book for the
4.07%:  could write a science book for the general
0.91%:  just thought of it at
0.91%:  can just about
0.91%:  think you just science fact
0.91%:  could go
2.31%:  could go for that

0.91%:  would like that to be true about
0.91%:  would like to hug that
0.91%:  think you just rewrote the science fact
0.91%:  could totally be wrong about that one

1.18%:  think we found out the true
0.90%:  just figured out a totally new science
0.90%:  would argue that if
0.90%:  should totally go to
1.56%:  should totally go to science
0.90%:  just got another theory
1.19%:  just got another theory for
0.90%:  just figured out how to talk science ner

0.88%:  could write a best
0.88%:  really just wanted to look at the
0.88%:  think you just beat the science out

0.87%:  could be wrong about this other
0.87%:  would like to note that just
0.87%:  need to think about that because
0.87%:  could totally be right about another

0.85%:  should tell
0.97%:  should tell you
1.56%:  should tell you about
0.93%:  should tell you about the

0.83%:  just thought of a better way science could look
0.83%:  hate to be the one to bust your world
0.83%:  think you just earned the cool
0.83%:  could totally be right about one or
0.83%:  would like that to be canon

0.83%:  should write that science book you
0.83%:  thought you looked nice
0.83%:  was looking for a better

0.83%:  forgot the whole
0.83%:  feel like you just beat
0.83%:  was talking to you
0.83%:  forgot to rule that out because dark
0.83%:  think you found the source
0.83%:  should write a book about theory
0.83%:  totally just thought of black

0.80%:  just created a new theory of both
1.75%:  just created a new theory of both science
0.80%:  feel like you just argued
0.80%:  really need to go back to just
0.80%:  could be wrong about all the science this one
0.80%:  totally forgot the dark
0.80%:  should write a book about science after
0.80%:  need to write a science book just to call
0.80%:  would totally go there!!

1.41%:  should write a book about current science that
0.79%:  just figured out how both
1.78%:  just figured out how both science
0.79%:  just got turned on by science for about
0.91%:  just got turned on by science for about three

0.78%:  like the sound of that way
14.13%:  like the sound of that way better!!
0.78%:  just got called out for science by the

0.78%:  would just like to be clear that the science
0.78%:  think you forgot the
1.37%:  think you forgot the word
0.78%:  really should get a
0.78%:  really think we could
0.78%:  just got a new theory for all

0.78%:  really need to think about how to argue
0.78%:  feel like you just won that
0.78%:  forgot you were an
0.78%:  always forget about science!!

0.78%:  like you better now than
0.78%:  think you just won the debate tour
0.78%:  just got called out on science theory
0.78%:  totally just figured out how to be real science
0.78%:  think science just got really hard!!

0.78%:  thought you were into science and
0.78%:  really regret
0.78%:  really thought it would be just
0.78%:  need to talk to all the other science bro
0.78%:  looked into that before

0.78%:  think you just brought one
0.78%:  forgot all about how
0.99%:  forgot all about how dark
0.78%:  forgot all about that theory we

0.78%:  thought you were a fake
0.78%:  can totally get on board with those
0.78%:  would totally agree that
0.78%:  just thought of a way to kill science once
0.78%:  just found out that the
0.78%:  need to get back to the library for science
0.77%:  really should write that science
1.89%:  really should write that science book
0.91%:  really should write that science book after
0.77%:  just figured out how to tell science teacher
0.77%:  just thought of like a
0.77%:  could write books about the science that
0.77%:  totally just broke the fourth
0.77%:  forgot about all these
1.75%:  forgot about all these other
0.77%:  thought you liked science better

0.77%:  figured that out just by
0.77%:  just got really worried about science
0.77%:  hate to break it to you d
0.77%:  should totally write a book of science but
0.77%:  really need to figure out how to bust
0.77%:  think science just found out we
0.77%:  think that could be our new science for
0.77%:  just got an idea for a better theory!!
0.77%:  forgot to include all that science
0.77%:  think you just brought science on
1.50%:  think you just brought science on board

0.75%:  reject that out of hand as
0.79%:  reject that out of hand as being
0.75%:  think you should get to
0.75%:  could be wrong about a lot of science then
0.75%:  hate that you know about science

0.74%:  just broke the theory
1.22%:  just broke the theory of rel
0.74%:  totally just figured out how there can be a
0.74%:  need to get back into science for
0.91%:  need to get back into science for real

0.74%:  just went through like four
0.74%:  totally just broke through science and into
0.74%:  need to figure out how to break that
0.74%:  should totally write a science bro book
0.74%:  just thought of a way to be a science

0.65%:  could write books about that science
0.65%:  need to go back to the library so
0.65%:  just figured out science all at
0.65%:  just figured out both how
0.65%:  just found a way to get
0.65%:  think we all just learned about the science of our
0.65%:  looked into that!!
0.65%:  forgot all about the black
0.65%:  hate to break this to you fellow science d
0.65%:  totally just won the science fight!!
0.65%:  kinda just blew
0.65%:  think we should totally forget science
0.65%:  think science just got cool for the
0.65%:  forgot about the recent dark
0.65%:  clearly need to get out
0.73%:  clearly need to get out of
0.88%:  clearly need to get out of science
0.65%:  would like that to be the real
0.65%:  think you just won a bet

0.65%:  hate to break it to all you science ch
0.65%:  gotta write that science book
0.65%:  think you just got real for real

0.64%:  just figured out a whole
0.64%:  think you just freed
1.25%:  think you just freed science
0.64%:  think we just got the science
0.64%:  just thought of a new band
0.64%:  just thought of a way around

0.64%:  think you just tore down
0.64%:  really just wanted to take
0.64%:  forgot that you know science
0.64%:  could write a science book that only
0.64%:  forgot about black holes but they
0.64%:  really just figured that

4.23%:  really just figured that one out!!
0.64%:  could write a book on these
0.64%:  just won the science fight!!
0.64%:  could be wrong about all of science but that is
0.64%:  think our theory
0.89%:  think our theory just
0.94%:  think our theory just got real
0.86%:  think our theory just got science
0.64%:  just had like
0.64%:  need to go back to the library to learn science

0.64%:  could totally be wrong about these!!
0.64%:  could totally be the first science bro
0.64%:  really need to figure out how to hack

0.64%:  think you just blown
0.64%:  should totally be working at
0.64%:  think you just counter
0.64%:  just figured out the science on
0.64%:  should write a book about the true science
0.64%:  bet you could get
1.06%:  bet you could get a science
0.64%:  could totally be right about both of
0.64%:  could really use a hug

0.64%:  really should know that
0.64%:  cannot tell
1.34%:  cannot tell you how glad

0.64%:  would like to note that the science
0.64%:  would like to hear the
20.55%:  would like to hear the rest of your
5.03%:  would like to hear the rest of your science
0.64%:  was born to be

0.73%:  was born to be a science guy
0.64%:  think you just won the science dollar
0.64%:  could be talking to the future when
0.64%:  wrote that book!!
0.64%:  just thought of a killer counter
0.64%:  think you just won science bro!!
0.64%:  just won the science battle for
0.64%:  should totally write the book on
0.64%:  totally just figured out science alone
0.64%:  really thought it would just be a
0.64%:  forgot to include that whole
0.64%:  think science just created
0.64%:  should go back
0.64%:  think you better go
0.64%:  wrote this
0.64%:  think science just got way cooler than
1.00%:  think science just got way cooler than before
0.64%:  should write a book about the science of un
0.64%:  like that theory so
0.64%:  think you just won the global science debate for real
0.64%:  could be wrong about all this you
0.64%:  totally wrote that joke
0.63%:  thought you were still on break

0.63%:  need to go to the library for science!!
0.63%:  thought you were still out
0.63%:  think our science teacher just got real
0.63%:  could be wrong about all of science but this theory
0.63%:  totally should be working for science
0.63%:  should write a book about science but tell
0.63%:  think you just won science factual
0.63%:  could write a book of
1.99%:  could write a book of science
0.63%:  think you just found science that
0.63%:  just thought of a better book idea
2.79%:  just thought of a better book idea!!
0.63%:  feel like you just let science through
0.63%:  just thought about science for like 
0.63%:  clearly need to start looking for science
0.63%:  totally forgot there could be a
0.63%:  thought for sure science would be able to track
0.63%:  forgot about all the other ways science could be true
0.63%:  forgot that science works
0.63%:  just thought of a new totally
0.63%:  just argued
1.08%:  just argued with
0.75%:  just argued with science
0.63%:  could be wrong about this but yeah
0.63%:  could write a book about all these science
0.63%:  really need to lock
0.63%:  should write a science book for all
0.63%:  thought you would be on
0.63%:  hate to be that guy but if
0.63%:  totally just figured out how al
0.63%:  hate to burst your balloon but the science of
0.63%:  thought you were nice but
0.63%:  just figured out that when
0.63%:  think you just got all of the science cred
0.63%:  thought you were just friend
0.63%:  hate to be wrong about this but you
0.63%:  thought for certain you would not
0.63%:  just blew your entire dark
0.63%:  think you just blew science out of the cold
0.63%:  think our science just got harder
0.63%:  got this
0.63%:  totally wrote this
0.63%:  should write a book about science but then call
0.63%:  really should know better than to go to
1.22%:  really should know better than to go to science
0.63%:  would just like to be clear that no
0.63%:  thought for certain nobody
0.63%:  just told
1.82%:  just told you that
0.96%:  just told you there

0.88%:  just told you there are
0.65%:  just told you there were
0.63%:  could totally see how
0.63%:  think you just created real science bro
0.63%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but not
0.63%:  totally just thought of a new science break
0.63%:  do not know about this guy but
0.63%:  thought you were just a science bro before!!
0.63%:  think we just created a science theory out
0.63%:  just figured out that science really
0.63%:  forgot science is
1.00%:  forgot science is allowed
1.12%:  forgot science is allowed to be
0.63%:  just got hit by a double wh
0.63%:  just got turned on to science for like
0.63%:  think you just rewrote all the science on
0.63%:  clearly need to write that

0.63%:  forgot you could be
0.86%:  forgot you could be this
0.63%:  feel like that could go
0.63%:  just thought about science and now
0.63%:  think you just heard a science fact
0.63%:  could get into that theory!!
0.63%:  can totally see that working for other
0.63%:  could talk
11.27%:  could talk about this theory
10.92%:  could talk about this for the
7.14%:  could talk about that
6.66%:  could talk about science
9.82%:  could talk about science for
53.42%:  could talk about science for hours!!
5.24%:  could talk about science for the

0.63%:  should write a book about the only science fact
0.63%:  was about to reject
0.63%:  think you just learned how to science!!
0.63%:  think you could be on the
0.63%:  think you just learned science!!
0.63%:  just figured out how black hole
0.63%:  just can
0.63%:  just got an idea for science theory
0.63%:  was totally talking to
0.63%:  think you just forgot what colour
0.63%:  think you just won the race to be
0.63%:  just thought of a new science and
0.63%:  told you these
0.63%:  could be wrong about this science but
0.63%:  would like to be clear that the
0.63%:  just got a new science theory that could be
0.63%:  just got owned by science for
0.63%:  really need to go talk
0.63%:  totally should be a science writer for the
0.63%:  thought you were a friend not
0.64%:  thought you were a friend not a science

0.63%:  forgot to rule that out because science!!
0.63%:  need to figure out how to carry
0.63%:  need to figure out how the
0.90%:  need to figure out how the science
0.63%:  bet you think
0.63%:  could be right all
0.63%:  should write a science book for younger
0.63%:  just had one of the great real
0.63%:  just broke through science and reality to
0.63%:  just blew all our science right out the fr
0.63%:  should write about that one
0.62%:  just got an idea of
0.62%:  just got burned by science for
0.62%:  think you just changed all science about
0.62%:  do not know about science but this
0.62%:  think we could totally
0.62%:  sure would like to be able
0.62%:  could be wrong about all of the science but that is
0.62%:  just got a science boner for like
0.62%:  think you found the true secret
0.62%:  would like to be best
0.62%:  just got a new theory about life
0.62%:  feel like that would be a
0.62%:  need to start wearing
0.62%:  would really rather not get into the
0.84%:  would really rather not get into the science
0.62%:  forgot about all the other weird
0.80%:  forgot about all the other weird science
0.62%:  need to go back to the science library to
0.62%:  totally just blew their
0.62%:  forgot about the entire subject
0.62%:  forgot to talk about science
0.62%:  should get a science book written for
0.62%:  think you better call the
1.08%:  think you better call the science
0.62%:  clearly need to write a book to
0.62%:  just thought of a new book about science
1.06%:  just thought of a new book about science called
0.62%:  would totally go for that because science!!
0.62%:  think you just won the science battle for real!!
0.62%:  think you just hat
0.62%:  like how you just brought science to bear
0.62%:  forgot that the answer could be science
0.62%:  forgot all about this dark
0.62%:  hate to break this to you but we all
0.62%:  could be wrong about the science but totally
0.62%:  just killed the theory of rel
0.62%:  will go
0.62%:  should totally write to
1.09%:  should totally write to the science
0.62%:  could totally write the science
0.62%:  should get a science book written!!
0.62%:  would totally forget this
0.62%:  need to talk to this science teacher
0.97%:  need to talk to this science teacher!!
0.62%:  think you just rewrote all of science to be true!!
0.62%:  could really go for a hot
0.62%:  could be wrong but that is
0.62%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but only
0.62%:  feel like you just went too
0.62%:  think you should let
0.62%:  just hit
0.62%:  feel like you just brought down a
0.62%:  think you just called out the
0.62%:  totally forgot there was a bunch
0.62%:  think we should forget
2.77%:  think we should forget about
3.09%:  think we should forget about science
0.81%:  think we should forget about all
0.62%:  like that better than regular science
0.62%:  would just like to be clear that you are not
0.62%:  just thought of a new science to create
1.07%:  just thought of a new science to create!!
0.62%:  really just figured out science!!
0.62%:  just wrote a science book and you thought
0.62%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to science bro
0.62%:  need to tell you about black
0.62%:  should write a book about all the funny
0.62%:  could be wrong about this but the only
0.62%:  just talked about science for an
1.35%:  just talked about science for an hour
0.62%:  just totally forgot about science!!
0.62%:  need to get back to science sooner!!
0.62%:  could be totally wrong about just
0.62%:  would argue that science is
0.62%:  think you just won the science degree
0.62%:  just talked about science while
0.62%:  need to go back to the fr
0.62%:  figured out the answer to both
0.62%:  totally just thought of a new science book deal
0.64%:  totally just thought of a new science book deal!!
0.62%:  really need to figure out how to attack
0.62%:  should tell you that
0.62%:  would totally be right
2.69%:  would totally be right about
0.62%:  forgot about the black body
0.62%:  really just wrote that out for
0.62%:  think we all just found a great
1.10%:  think we all just found a great science
0.62%:  really think we should go to outer
0.62%:  would be the first to agree
0.62%:  just totally thought of a new science idea
1.76%:  just totally thought of a new science idea!!
0.62%:  forgot you were a science bro until that
0.78%:  forgot you were a science bro until that just
0.62%:  could get into science
0.63%:  could get into science after
0.62%:  just thought about it real
0.62%:  could talk about science for the whole
1.34%:  could talk about science for the whole rest
0.62%:  just took the
0.62%:  would buy tickets to a science
0.62%:  could be talking to science
0.62%:  think you just won the science r
0.62%:  just went through an
0.62%:  can just hear you
0.62%:  totally just figured out we
0.62%:  reject that theory for no
0.62%:  just figured out how to be the science
0.62%:  was totally right about one
0.62%:  think we just got a theory for
0.62%:  really should work on better
0.62%:  just got hit by a car
0.62%:  was about to call you out
3.24%:  was about to call you out for being
1.19%:  was about to call you out for being the
0.62%:  think you just changed all science for real!!
0.62%:  just got an idea for another web
0.62%:  should write that science book real
0.62%:  just figured out how to be totally science
0.62%:  think you just got too science
0.62%:  thought for sure you knew
1.09%:  thought for sure you knew better
0.62%:  should write a science book but not
0.95%:  should write a science book but not really
0.62%:  really need to figure out how to block science
0.62%:  just thought of a tr
0.62%:  could be wrong about this all
0.62%:  think you just got all of science on board
0.62%:  want to hear
0.62%:  really just wanted to look for
0.62%:  thought you were a real science bro
0.62%:  think you just rewrote all of science and taught
0.62%:  would totally go for that because it
0.62%:  just got an idea of what
0.61%:  should write a book of science that reject
0.61%:  think you just wrote our
0.97%:  think you just wrote our science
0.61%:  could be wrong about this for real
0.61%:  totally just forgot how
0.61%:  thought you worked for science but

0.61%:  think we just turned
4.10%:  think we just turned science
0.61%:  need to go to the science lab
0.61%:  should write about that before
0.61%:  told you there was no
0.61%:  think you just retro
0.61%:  could write a science book just on
6.96%:  could write a science book just on that theory
1.24%:  could write a science book just on that!!
0.78%:  could write a science book just on that one
0.61%:  just figured out what that book
0.61%:  could be wrong about that but there
0.61%:  just blew your idea

0.98%:  think you need to be careful about what science
0.76%:  think you need to be careful what
0.58%:  just felt
0.58%:  should write a book of science but
0.58%:  just figured out the way
0.58%:  totally forgot about these
0.58%:  thought you were all fake bros until
0.58%:  just thought of a really bad book
0.76%:  just thought of a really bad book title
0.78%:  just thought of a really bad book title!!
0.58%:  need to talk to you about this for science!!
0.58%:  would argue that your science
0.58%:  clearly need to look further
0.58%:  totally just thought of a brand new book
0.58%:  think we found our latest
1.97%:  think we found our latest science
3.25%:  think we found our latest science theory
3.76%:  think we found our latest science theory!!
0.97%:  think we found our latest theory
0.88%:  think we found our latest science theory to
0.58%:  just noticed you were
0.58%:  should write a science book but only after
0.58%:  gotta take
0.58%:  think you forgot to tell
0.58%:  forgot that you were still

0.58%:  could be right about all the fake
0.58%:  feel like we just had our
0.58%:  forgot one
0.58%:  think you just grabbed the science ball
0.58%:  think you just brought science too far and we
0.58%:  just got way
0.58%:  feel like science just got cooler than
0.58%:  think science just got real for you
0.58%:  really should write a book that
0.58%:  really think we just found the true
0.58%:  think you just argued for the real
0.58%:  clearly need to write a book just
0.58%:  think you just got science real
0.58%:  forgot to rule out that because
0.58%:  really need to figure out who just
0.58%:  think our science just got way cool
0.58%:  should totally write to science
0.58%:  think you just flew
0.58%:  looked that
0.58%:  thought you were all fake until
0.58%:  think we just found our totally real
1.02%:  think we just found our totally real science
0.58%:  think you just created the real
0.58%:  reject this out of hand but only
0.58%:  do not know the
0.58%:  just figured out what to tell science
0.58%:  could write a science book about all
0.93%:  could write a science book about all these
0.58%:  really would
0.58%:  just got better
11.11%:  just got better at science
6.77%:  just got better at science!!
1.13%:  just got better at science and
0.75%:  just got better at science for
0.96%:  just got better at science for real
0.72%:  just got better at science and you
0.69%:  just got better at science while
1.13%:  just got better at science while you
0.58%:  should totally write a science fact book then
0.58%:  just got all the science!!
0.58%:  refuse to be outdone
0.60%:  refuse to be outdone by science

0.71%:  just got all the way out of bed
0.63%:  just got all the way out here
0.61%:  just got all the way out of the
0.58%:  could be totally wrong about science this
0.58%:  gotta think that
0.58%:  think you just lowered the bar to
0.58%:  just got turned on by science for the whole
0.58%:  forgot to tell you the science behind
0.58%:  really just thought of a new
0.58%:  just wrote a science book that you
0.58%:  think you just brought to
0.58%:  think you just won science bro battle
0.58%:  really should write a science book after
0.58%:  think you just got a science fact
0.58%:  think you just bought science
0.58%:  just won the science lottery for like a
0.58%:  hate to be this
6.83%:  hate to be this guy but
0.58%:  just thought of a totally cred
12.37%:  just thought of a totally credible science
2.28%:  just thought of a totally credible new

0.58%:  forgot all about the recent
0.58%:  think science just got a lot cool
0.58%:  really need to figure out what sort
0.58%:  need to write a book just to call
0.58%:  think we can
0.74%:  think we can all agree to
0.58%:  thought we could talk about real science for one
0.58%:  just forgot how to be certain about science
0.58%:  think you could just
0.58%:  really feel
0.58%:  would buy that!!
0.58%:  need to go back to the library just
0.58%:  think we just found our great science
0.71%:  think we just found our great science theory
0.58%:  think we found science!!
0.58%:  think we all just got our theory
0.60%:  think we all just got our theory of science
0.58%:  would not be against
0.58%:  could totally see that being a
0.58%:  like the sound of that really
0.58%:  think science just got way better all
0.58%:  just blew all your science out of the back

0.58%:  thought about it already
0.71%:  thought about it already!!
0.58%:  had better
0.58%:  can just about feel
0.58%:  really should think
1.37%:  really should think before
0.71%:  really should think about science
1.64%:  really should think about science before
0.58%:  hate to break this to all
3.31%:  hate to break this to all of science
3.42%:  hate to break this to all of science but
1.59%:  hate to break this to all of you but

0.58%:  feel like that just brought science one
0.58%:  just figured out all science by
0.58%:  could be wrong about the rest of science theory!!
0.58%:  forgot about the dark theory!!
0.58%:  can just hear the science
0.58%:  need to figure out what other
0.58%:  feel like you just brought a science
0.58%:  just talked to a real
0.58%:  would still argue that you
0.58%:  just thought of a way to corner
0.58%:  thought for certain you would be on
0.58%:  really need to go back to science now
0.58%:  forgot about all those science
0.58%:  thought for sure you were not
0.58%:  think you just brought down science fact
0.58%:  think we should totally be
0.58%:  would be the first science
0.58%:  need to go to the store
0.58%:  got science
0.58%:  should write science for
0.58%:  just wrote a science book about that
0.58%:  clearly need to work through
0.58%:  refuse to allow that to be science
0.58%:  could be wrong about all the science about
0.58%:  really need to get back into science just
0.80%:  really need to get back into science just for
0.58%:  feel like your
0.58%:  could be right about one of these!!
0.58%:  refuse to be wrong about the science
0.57%:  would like to go to that funeral
0.57%:  should totally write for the
0.57%:  forgot to say what dark
0.57%:  just talked to a science
0.91%:  just talked to a science guy
0.57%:  could really go for a t
0.57%:  forgot about that and now you
0.57%:  could be totally right about one
0.57%:  could be right about other
0.57%:  think you just threw science fact
0.57%:  think we all just got science harder
0.57%:  forget where
0.57%:  could be wrong about not
0.57%:  think you just heard science get blown
1.25%:  think you just heard science get blown out
0.57%:  gotta call the
1.23%:  gotta call the science
0.57%:  need to go work
1.27%:  need to go work on that
1.87%:  need to go work on that theory!!
0.59%:  need to go work on that science
0.57%:  thought you were for science and
0.75%:  thought you were for science and not
0.57%:  could write a science book just about all
0.57%:  think you just won that debate for
0.57%:  could write a book about just the
1.03%:  could write a book about just the science
0.57%:  sure would like to go
0.57%:  need to write that story
0.57%:  thought you cared about science before we
0.57%:  would like that to be the case but science
0.57%:  just got a new theory for both
0.77%:  just got a new theory for both science
0.57%:  think you just lowered the science
4.17%:  think you just lowered the science bar for
2.57%:  think you just lowered the science bar for all
0.90%:  think you just lowered the science bar to
0.57%:  could be wrong about the totally
1.62%:  could be wrong about the totally fake
0.57%:  just thought of a better way science could be broken!!
0.57%:  just created a science theory with
0.57%:  just thought of a really weird science book

0.57%:  forgot about all those dark
0.57%:  thought about it!!
0.57%:  need to tell the
0.79%:  need to tell the science
0.57%:  would still argue they are fake but
0.57%:  reject this theory on two
0.57%:  really need to figure out how to not talk
0.57%:  could be wrong about the history of science but let
0.57%:  just talked about science theory for the
0.57%:  think the world just got cool
0.57%:  totally just figured out how a
0.57%:  feel like we just got our
0.90%:  feel like we just got our science
1.70%:  feel like we just got our science on!!
0.57%:  think the science world just got a lot cool
0.57%:  could totally go for another
0.57%:  think science just found a way out
0.57%:  feel like that theory just got blown
0.57%:  need to tell you about science
0.57%:  forgot about all the weird

0.57%:  totally figured out the science
0.57%:  forgot about the science and

0.56%:  think science just got really cool for one
0.56%:  just got an idea for a better science theory
1.59%:  just got an idea for a better science theory!!
0.56%:  looked that one
0.56%:  just noticed your
0.56%:  could be wrong about this too
0.56%:  should really write that science book before
0.56%:  would just like to be clear about one
0.56%:  could write a book about the science just
0.56%:  just wrote an entire book about the
1.02%:  just wrote an entire book about the science

0.56%:  reject that theory based
0.56%:  think we just created science out
0.56%:  think you gotta
0.56%:  could be wrong about all the science but these
0.56%:  would totally eat that book
0.56%:  hate you for knowing these

0.53%:  could write a science book just about that one!!
0.53%:  should really get into
3.28%:  should really get into science
0.60%:  should really get into science before
0.53%:  feel like you just brought science to a battle
0.53%:  need to figure out why that
0.53%:  just got a new theory for that
0.53%:  could totally be wrong about these science
0.53%:  think we should call our science
0.53%:  just called you out for not being a real science bro
0.69%:  just called you out for not being a real science bro!!
0.53%:  just found out that all science
0.53%:  forgot to use
0.53%:  should totally be a science writer after
0.53%:  should totally write a book for ner
0.53%:  just figured out whether or not all
0.53%:  think we just had science
0.53%:  just figured out what all the science book
0.53%:  need to figure out how that joke
0.53%:  could totally see that working for science but

0.53%:  just got called out on science by a fr
0.53%:  hate to break this to our future
0.53%:  really should write a science book that
0.53%:  thought for sure science would be able to let
0.53%:  need to figure out how to steal all
0.53%:  really need to learn about science though
0.53%:  really need to get back on that
0.59%:  really need to get back on that science
0.53%:  just thought of a new science about
0.75%:  just thought of a new science about dark
0.53%:  should really get to

0.53%:  could totally write that on
0.53%:  really think we just found the science
0.53%:  think you just lowered the science bar too
0.53%:  just figured out what science can be
0.53%:  hate to be wrong about dark
0.53%:  just figured out what one
0.53%:  could be totally wrong about the science here but fr
0.53%:  would like that to be true for sure
0.53%:  forgot that science could still
0.53%:  just broke the fourth wall and you can
0.53%:  could be wrong about all the science before this!!
0.53%:  feel like that could be a story
0.53%:  would like to buy the
0.53%:  think you just went science
0.53%:  figured out the answer to all the science!!
0.53%:  think that could be totally
0.53%:  thought you left because
0.53%:  could be wrong about a lot of science but this
0.53%:  need to talk to you in
0.53%:  just thought of a new book and

0.53%:  could be looking
1.57%:  could be looking at the
0.53%:  just tri
0.53%:  just thought of a brand new science you
0.53%:  just figured out the science to a
0.53%:  should write a book about the science guy
0.53%:  forgot about the science theory!!
0.53%:  should totally write that book before science
0.53%:  really ought to write a book about science
0.53%:  forgot about that tiny
0.52%:  just thought of a science career!!
0.52%:  should totally work at

0.52%:  could talk about this for longer
0.96%:  could talk about this for longer than you
0.52%:  forgot to breathe
0.52%:  could be wrong about science for only
0.52%:  could be totally wrong about the science but if
0.52%:  could totally be the one who figures out science
0.74%:  could totally be the one who figures out science!!
0.52%:  always thought it could be fake
0.52%:  need to talk with you later

0.51%:  should really be working
0.82%:  should really be working on that
0.51%:  just thought of one better!!
0.51%:  need to go think about that because
0.51%:  refuse to allow science to und
0.51%:  think we should be careful not to go
0.51%:  would like for that to be the least
0.51%:  think we found the subject
0.51%:  think you just blew all our science to date
0.51%:  would like to buy that for one

0.51%:  just figured out what all three
0.51%:  think you just went too hard
0.51%:  forgot you weren
0.51%:  should write a book about the only true science!!

0.51%:  totally just found out how science
0.51%:  need to write a science book so
0.51%:  clearly forgot
0.51%:  better go
0.51%:  think you just won the science cred
0.51%:  just thought of a way to turn black
0.51%:  just got a theory that could
0.51%:  hate to break it to you!!
0.51%:  think you need to watch
0.51%:  really need to start looking for a job
0.51%:  think you just rewrote science for that
0.51%:  feel like the world just got that
0.51%:  just thought of a new book to buy
0.51%:  reject that out of hand as science
0.51%:  need to talk to you about the

0.51%:  would like that to be an
0.51%:  think you just got the science award for 
0.51%:  just had a great science
0.51%:  just got another science
0.51%:  really should get to work on science
0.51%:  could be the only
0.51%:  think we just created a science theory out of our
0.51%:  just forgot to
4.09%:  just forgot to breathe
1.60%:  just forgot to breathe!!

0.51%:  refuse to take you
0.51%:  need to think of a better way
0.51%:  do not like the
0.51%:  would buy that science book right
0.51%:  forgot about the totally real science
0.51%:  would call that a theory
0.51%:  would hate
1.38%:  would hate to think
0.87%:  would hate to be the
2.33%:  would hate to be the one to burst
3.98%:  would hate to be the one to burst your ball

0.65%:  would hate to be the guy
0.51%:  could totally see that working for the science bro
0.51%:  just forgot to breathe while
0.51%:  think our science just got harder!!
0.51%:  should totally write back
0.51%:  think you just need to go
0.51%:  forgot there was science behind
0.51%:  could just
0.51%:  really need to start backing
0.51%:  really need to talk about this science
0.51%:  think you should get a job at a science center for
0.51%:  forgot to include all that other junk

1.25%:  really ought to know about this before
1.18%:  really ought to know about that
0.55%:  really ought to know about these
0.51%:  think you just got a whole lot of
0.68%:  think you just got a whole lot of science

0.51%:  should totally get a job at science
0.51%:  clearly need to work out
0.51%:  think you need to be careful about science
0.51%:  could be wrong about the science but the only
0.51%:  just talked about science theory for three
0.51%:  need to go talk to the
0.91%:  need to go talk to the science
0.51%:  just found a new theory to
0.51%:  totally should write a book on science
0.51%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science in
0.51%:  just thought of a new role
0.51%:  thought for sure you wanted
1.20%:  thought for sure you wanted to talk
0.51%:  could talk about how
0.61%:  could talk about how that

2.27%:  could be wrong about the truth of reality
2.02%:  could be wrong about the truth of reality!!
0.51%:  just broke through to an
0.86%:  just broke through to an entire
0.50%:  just thought of real
2.31%:  just thought of real science
0.72%:  just thought of real dark
0.60%:  just thought of real science and
0.60%:  just thought of real science!!
0.53%:  just thought of real science to
0.83%:  just thought of real science to back
0.50%:  just won the science lecture
0.50%:  could write science books about that theory
1.07%:  could write science books about that theory!!
0.50%:  just got turned on by science all
0.50%:  was totally being
0.50%:  think you just won the science of our
0.50%:  thought science was only
1.16%:  thought science was only about
0.50%:  think there just
0.50%:  reject the notion of
0.50%:  thought about it for a second but really
0.50%:  feel like that just brought science and
0.50%:  think you just changed science to better allow
0.50%:  will say
0.50%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to your
0.50%:  could write a book about these!!
0.50%:  should write that on a book
0.50%:  was born to be the
0.50%:  just broke the whole
0.79%:  just broke the whole science
0.50%:  would like that to be the least
0.50%:  just talked about science for the whole article
0.50%:  could totally see that working on science
0.50%:  just wrote a science book and the
0.52%:  just wrote a science book and the only
0.50%:  hate you for knowing that because
0.50%:  just thought of it and you were
0.50%:  would like the
0.50%:  just thought of a new baby
0.50%:  think we all just got our science doctor
0.50%:  just figured out a science that
0.50%:  need to talk to this guy real
0.50%:  could be wrong about those little
0.50%:  just got turned into a science bro by
0.50%:  could be wrong about the last four
0.50%:  would rather eat
0.50%:  feel like science just had
0.50%:  can feel the ground
0.50%:  need to think about how to argue
0.50%:  just got an idea for another science lecture book
2.43%:  just got an idea for another science lecture book!!
0.50%:  feel like you just brought the science down on
0.50%:  would like to reject your
0.50%:  just broke science theory
0.50%:  thought you were real for so
0.50%:  forgot about all the science that would
0.50%:  thought you wanted to talk science before
0.50%:  really ought to think before
0.50%:  think you just got a bunch
4.27%:  think you just got a bunch of science

0.49%:  think science just turned
0.49%:  just thought about it for a
0.49%:  just figured out both why
0.49%:  think you just created the science for a
0.49%:  feel like you just got a lot
0.49%:  should write a book that reject
0.49%:  really should take better
0.49%:  could totally be working on science that
0.49%:  just fell down a rabbit hole onto
0.49%:  just got hit by a science truck and there
0.49%:  just thought of a way to be killed
0.49%:  need to get back into science just
0.49%:  think we should all go out to

0.50%:  used to think you were real
0.49%:  need to think about that all
0.49%:  just got owned by the
0.60%:  just got owned by the science
0.49%:  should totally go write that
0.68%:  should totally go write that science
0.49%:  need to start looking for a
0.49%:  totally bought
1.23%:  totally bought that for
3.52%:  totally bought that for a second!!
1.09%:  totally bought that for like
0.49%:  just figured out how to call the
0.49%:  think you just blew all other
1.92%:  think you just blew all other science
0.49%:  could go either
18.43%:  could go either way on that one!!

0.49%:  think you just rewrote the science around
0.49%:  think you just changed two science
0.49%:  would be the first to thank
0.71%:  would be the first to thank science
0.49%:  think you just created what science
0.49%:  think you just rewrote science to reflect
0.49%:  could be wrong about that one for
1.45%:  could be wrong about that one for sure
1.70%:  could be wrong about that one for sure!!
0.49%:  think you just got real science for real once
0.49%:  think you just blew science out of control!!
0.49%:  thought you were all fake bros too
0.49%:  was right about one
0.49%:  just figured out how to create another
0.49%:  really just thought of a new science
0.49%:  need to work on that science
0.49%:  really need to figure out what books
0.49%:  really need to get back to this
0.49%:  hate to be the first to call you wrong
0.49%:  just thought of a really cute science
0.49%:  thought you were science bros but

0.49%:  hate to be the guy to call
0.49%:  totally forgot that science could answer
0.49%:  need to figure out how to brush
0.49%:  really need to get back to science now
0.49%:  forgot about all the science in
0.49%:  think you just threw out a great
0.84%:  think you just threw out a great science
0.49%:  think our science has
0.49%:  need to go back to the future just
0.49%:  just created the theory of all
0.49%:  would totally be fine
0.49%:  forgot that this
0.49%:  just got turned on by science for like 
0.49%:  always forget that there
0.49%:  think we just created a theory of science out
0.49%:  just figured out why all the black
0.49%:  just thought of a way science could be broken to
0.49%:  could be wrong about this science theory
0.49%:  always forget that science could
0.49%:  refuse to look into that theory
0.82%:  refuse to look into that theory!!
0.49%:  just got really hot
0.59%:  just got really hot for
0.97%:  just got really hot for science
0.57%:  just got really hot for science!!
0.49%:  just told you what
0.49%:  thought you knew science too
0.49%:  just thought of about a
0.49%:  think we just created a science theory of
1.29%:  think we just created a science theory of our
0.49%:  just need to figure out how to break all
0.49%:  could be wrong on that last
0.49%:  think you should be a science bro
0.49%:  think we just got to the core of science and
0.49%:  thought you were cooler
0.49%:  hate to break this to you science ner

0.49%:  need to go to the science library just
0.49%:  need to get out of science club
0.49%:  really need to start being
0.49%:  forgot to tell you there was a science
0.49%:  really just thought of it!!
0.49%:  forgot to use science
0.49%:  forgot to rule out those
0.49%:  think you just found a science teacher
0.49%:  kinda want that
14.68%:  kinda want that to be true!!
0.70%:  kinda want that to be the
0.62%:  kinda want that to be true so
0.49%:  think you just won the science for real!!
0.49%:  think you just got all the science to be
0.49%:  need to call science right now before
0.49%:  just thought of a way to let
0.59%:  just thought of a way to let science
0.49%:  just think about science too hard for
0.49%:  just blew your entire science fact book

1.78%:  think you are about to change science
0.49%:  need to go buy
0.49%:  hate you!!
0.49%:  could use that theory for
0.49%:  just totally figured out another
0.49%:  think the world just got real for
0.49%:  just got called out by science in
1.89%:  just got called out by science in front

0.48%:  think you just got all of the science done
0.48%:  would like to be clear about
0.48%:  just got hit by the dark
0.48%:  could be totally wrong about the science for this
0.48%:  really need to focus
0.48%:  think you just found the greater
0.48%:  just figured out the only science
0.51%:  just figured out the only science that
0.48%:  could be right all the
0.48%:  need to write a science book for young
0.48%:  think you just won the science debate of our great
0.48%:  think you just created a science where all of
0.48%:  would totally forget to eat
0.48%:  think you just caught one!!

0.48%:  just threw out the
0.48%:  thought you were fake bros!!
0.48%:  forgot all about non
0.48%:  would like for that to be true real
0.48%:  kinda just thought about

0.48%:  think you just got real hot
0.48%:  thought you were all about deb
0.48%:  could be talking about real science just by
0.48%:  just found out how to be
0.48%:  think you just turned all the science for
0.48%:  would hate to think about
0.48%:  should totally work on that before
0.48%:  totally forgot to think

0.48%:  just went back
0.59%:  just went back through
0.48%:  just got an idea for a whole other
0.65%:  just got an idea for a whole other science
0.48%:  really want to go back to bed
0.48%:  need to get out of this country
0.48%:  thought for sure science would be able to beat
0.48%:  could be wrong about that science

0.48%:  thought of a
0.93%:  thought of a counter
0.78%:  thought of a better
0.74%:  thought of a better answer
0.64%:  thought of a better reason

0.51%:  thought of a new
0.48%:  need to get back to this later
0.95%:  need to get back to this later!!
0.48%:  refuse to rule that theory
1.63%:  refuse to rule that theory out!!
0.48%:  think you just forced science to get
0.48%:  think we found our true
0.48%:  should really be working on that science
0.48%:  could use a little
0.48%:  thought science was cool until you talked
0.48%:  thought you were a science fact
0.48%:  forgot to answer that!!
0.48%:  totally just wrote science fact
0.48%:  think you just found the core science

0.48%:  just got called out by another
0.58%:  just got called out by another science
0.65%:  just got called out by another science bro

0.48%:  just got all the way out of science and
0.48%:  think you just won the science bro battle for
0.48%:  think you just changed all of science better
0.48%:  think you just got the world a
0.48%:  could be wrong about the science that
0.48%:  would like that theory to be true for science
0.48%:  really need to go back to not
0.48%:  would like to be the science
0.48%:  could be totally wrong about this then
0.67%:  could be totally wrong about this then!!
0.48%:  just figured out what all the science break
0.48%:  know this theory
0.48%:  just need to know if
0.48%:  should write the book about
0.48%:  think you just created three
0.48%:  just figured out how the science really
0.48%:  should write a book about science to
0.48%:  really thought we could use
5.16%:  really thought we could use science
0.59%:  really thought we could use science for
0.48%:  totally just figured out how to be a black
0.48%:  just got a chill

0.48%:  just figured out that science only
0.48%:  just broke the whole science of
0.48%:  forgot that you were there
0.48%:  could write a book of science that
0.48%:  should totally be a science writer for one

0.48%:  could totally see that working for an
0.48%:  thought science was a
0.48%:  think we found the actual
0.53%:  think we found the actual science
0.48%:  think we just found real science to be
0.48%:  should write a book about science bro

0.50%:  just won the science for real
0.49%:  just won the science for today
0.48%:  think you just reached a
0.48%:  would like that to be a theory
0.48%:  forgot about the science that
0.48%:  forgot about the black holes and
0.48%:  would still argue that there
0.48%:  feel like you just turned a
0.59%:  feel like you just turned a science
0.48%:  totally just won science for real
0.48%:  want that to be the
0.48%:  could be totally wrong about that one
0.48%:  cannot be
0.48%:  had to
0.48%:  would like to see that on the
1.29%:  would like to see that on the science
0.48%:  forgot to tell you earlier that
0.48%:  like the sound of your science but

0.48%:  need to think about that science
0.72%:  need to think about that science for
0.48%:  hate to break it to your science bros but
0.47%:  could be wrong about it
0.47%:  like what
1.64%:  like what you just
0.47%:  should totally write about science
0.47%:  like the sound of that but now
0.47%:  need to talk to this guy before

0.47%:  refuse to rule out any
0.47%:  think we just got an
0.47%:  hate it when you get all
3.76%:  hate it when you get all science
0.47%:  feel like that just turned science
0.47%:  feel like that just changed science
0.47%:  can totally see that working for science but
0.47%:  totally should write science fact
0.47%:  could totally write a book of science that
0.47%:  forgot you could talk
0.47%:  just got the idea for a science lecture
0.47%:  think you just got that science
0.47%:  feel like you just changed our science
0.47%:  thought for sure science couldn
0.47%:  need to talk to the guy who first
0.47%:  need to talk to you right now before

0.47%:  forget how to
4.65%:  forget how to breathe
1.73%:  forget how to breathe!!
0.47%:  just thought of a brand new science break
0.47%:  think you need to be careful about who
0.47%:  think we just found your science
0.47%:  just thought of nine
0.47%:  totally just thought of real science and now
0.47%:  was about to get really
0.47%:  think you just won science for re
0.47%:  used to think you were too
0.47%:  just got an idea for a book where the only
0.47%:  just told you about the
0.47%:  would be the first to be
0.47%:  think you just changed all of science to be about two
0.47%:  need to get to the library to
0.47%:  just got science hard on you!!
0.47%:  would be the first one to tell
0.47%:  was totally right about science
0.47%:  think you just got cold
0.47%:  will take that theory to science and
0.47%:  think you just won the science bet for
0.47%:  could talk about giants for three
0.47%:  should write a book that totally
0.47%:  just thought of a way to tell dark
0.47%:  should really think
0.71%:  should really think about science
1.55%:  should really think about science before
0.61%:  should really think before
0.47%:  think you just blew science and
0.47%:  just got an idea for how the
0.47%:  could write a science book just on the
0.47%:  used to think you were the science
0.47%:  just figured out how to totally rock
1.18%:  just figured out how to totally rock science
0.47%:  really thought about it for once
0.47%:  just got a science boner you
0.47%:  cannot wait
1.67%:  cannot wait for
4.41%:  cannot wait for science
2.73%:  cannot wait for the science

0.83%:  cannot wait for the science to
0.49%:  cannot wait for the book
0.47%:  should write a science book about only
0.91%:  should write a science book about only the
0.47%:  just figured out why science can be
0.47%:  think you just won that debate for real
0.60%:  think you just won that debate for real!!
0.47%:  just figured out a way to control
0.47%:  forgot this theory
0.47%:  just talked about science with an
0.47%:  thought it was fake
0.49%:  thought it was fake too but
0.47%:  think you just found that science
0.47%:  just blew science right out the back end
0.47%:  was about to tell you the
0.47%:  thought you knew all
3.23%:  thought you knew all about science
1.48%:  thought you knew all about science before
0.78%:  thought you knew all about science!!
0.53%:  thought you knew all about science and
0.47%:  just got an idea for another science theory
1.83%:  just got an idea for another science theory!!
0.47%:  think we just totally found the
0.47%:  just got turned into a science bro for
0.47%:  thought you were into science before!!
0.47%:  just got trick
2.52%:  just got tricked by science
0.80%:  just got tricked by a science
0.52%:  just got tricked by science!!
0.47%:  just thought of a science to
0.47%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science theory!!
0.47%:  should totally write a book but then
0.47%:  totally just had a science org
0.47%:  forgot all about the dark theory
0.47%:  just figured out how to track
0.47%:  would like to note that before
0.47%:  just wrote a really
4.57%:  just wrote a really good science
2.21%:  just wrote a really good science article
3.19%:  just wrote a really good science article!!
1.99%:  just wrote a really good science book

0.47%:  could write a book for
1.16%:  could write a book for that
0.93%:  could write a book for that!!
0.89%:  could write a book for that theory
0.56%:  could write a book for science
0.47%:  forgot that other
0.47%:  just need to write
0.47%:  could be wrong about that first
0.47%:  thought you were just a science bro for
0.47%:  could really go for a sn
0.47%:  would rather be a
0.47%:  just talked about science for the whole article!!

0.47%:  really need to go to the wash
0.47%:  think you just blew out the candle
0.47%:  really should be working on better

0.56%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier today
0.91%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier today!!
0.47%:  forgot to rule out black holes and white
0.47%:  think you just got called out on science
0.47%:  should write a book about science not
0.47%:  could write a book just on that one
0.47%:  think he
1.56%:  think he just blew
1.12%:  think he just called
1.00%:  think he just blew our
0.59%:  think he just blew your
0.55%:  think he just got
0.47%:  forgot to tell you there was science
0.67%:  forgot to tell you there was science behind
0.47%:  finally got
0.47%:  just figured out that all other
0.77%:  just figured out that all other science
0.47%:  would hate to be the first to
0.47%:  just wrote an entire book for the
0.47%:  just talked about science with you for 
0.47%:  just created a new theory!!
0.47%:  could really go for one
0.47%:  could totally write that for

1.04%:  really forgot about that until
0.56%:  really forgot about this
0.47%:  thought of a better answer!!
0.47%:  need to figure out what science looks
0.47%:  feel like you just brought science to the br
0.47%:  hate to be the one to ruin
0.47%:  should write a science book for three
0.47%:  should really write a science book but
0.47%:  should really write a science book but then
0.47%:  just figured out that other
0.47%:  could be wrong about all these other fant
0.47%:  forgot about the science world
0.47%:  could be wrong about the science but if
0.61%:  could be wrong about the science but if that
0.47%:  just forgot how to talk!!
0.47%:  think you just changed to science bro
0.47%:  think you just rewrote the science!!
0.47%:  just figured out the two
0.47%:  really just want to go back to before
0.47%:  feel like that should go
0.47%:  figured out the science
0.47%:  could write a book just about science
0.47%:  think you just let science out
8.58%:  think you just let science out of the bag!!
1.18%:  think you just let science out of the bag and
0.47%:  reject this theory out of a
0.47%:  would like that to be true but science has
0.47%:  just blew your science right out of the ocean and
0.47%:  could be the first guy to know that
0.47%:  just thought of a new and totally
0.47%:  just talked about science with you for an
0.47%:  really just wanted to get to
0.47%:  think we all just agreed on science

0.46%:  clearly need to talk about science with
0.46%:  just wrote an entire science blog
0.46%:  just figured out how to clear the
0.46%:  just found out where all the science
0.46%:  think for once science
0.46%:  just got really into science for one
0.46%:  could be talking to a real science
0.46%:  just talked about science for longer than you were
0.46%:  should write a book of that
0.46%:  forgot about science and now
0.46%:  just broke science theory with
0.46%:  thought about it for one second!!

0.46%:  could be totally wrong on this!!
0.46%:  just created a theory of science to
0.46%:  think you just rewrote the balance of our
0.46%:  think you just found science a whole
0.46%:  just thought of a way science can be turned
0.46%:  should totally write a book for the science genre

0.46%:  thought you were secret
0.46%:  need to figure out how to science that real
0.46%:  feel really good
6.40%:  feel really good about this

0.46%:  just figured that out by
0.46%:  should write a book about the great science
0.46%:  could be wrong about all of the science but they
0.46%:  thought science was only for
0.46%:  think we all just got our science theory
0.49%:  think we all just got our science theory for
0.46%:  could be talking about science when
0.46%:  could be right after
0.46%:  really need to know about this science
0.46%:  need science
0.70%:  need science to figure
2.90%:  need science to figure out what
2.18%:  need science to figure out how
2.03%:  need science to figure out what colour

0.46%:  would rather you not tell
0.46%:  think you just told science how
0.46%:  would like to enter
0.53%:  would like to enter that

0.46%:  would still argue that your
0.46%:  should write a book about truth
0.46%:  hate you for being such
0.46%:  forgot there were still
0.46%:  just found a theory
0.46%:  really like the sound of that but science
0.46%:  just blew science right out the front
2.76%:  just blew science right out the front door!!
0.46%:  could be wrong about your
0.46%:  think we just found out there are
0.46%:  just figured out that non
0.46%:  think you just turned all the science we
0.46%:  just figured out how to beat all the science bro
0.46%:  think you just caught an
0.46%:  just thought of a better ac
0.46%:  think you just brought real science to a debate of
0.46%:  just broke through science and into actual

0.46%:  think you just let out
0.46%:  forgot that when
0.65%:  forgot that when you
0.46%:  need to look this theory
0.46%:  would rather not think of
0.46%:  think you found us
0.46%:  just got hit by a science truck and now there
0.46%:  just broke through into
0.46%:  would like that theory to be real!!

0.46%:  just figured out not only that
0.46%:  could totally write another
1.39%:  could totally write another science
2.88%:  could totally write another science book
2.50%:  could totally write another science book!!
0.81%:  could totally write another book!!
0.46%:  think we just learned science!!
0.46%:  just created the science theory of all
0.46%:  just thought of a totally new role

2.32%:  just blew your entire science out the back door of
2.29%:  just blew your entire science out the back of
0.45%:  just created a new theory for science to look
0.45%:  think we just got science done
0.49%:  think we just got science done!!
0.45%:  forgot we already
0.45%:  clearly need to work on that
0.45%:  feel like we just brought science and
0.45%:  now
0.45%:  just got turned on by a science bro
0.45%:  would totally go see that science
0.45%:  could write a book about you!!
0.45%:  just figured out how real science
0.45%:  could be wrong about the first 
0.45%:  just figured out that what science
0.45%:  would argue that if you
0.45%:  can totally see that working for our science!!
0.45%:  forgot about that theory we
0.45%:  should write a book of totally
0.45%:  just figured out the hole
0.45%:  need to tell you how
0.45%:  just looked into the ab
0.45%:  told you those
0.61%:  told you those were fake
0.45%:  should write a blog about the
1.18%:  should write a blog about the science
0.45%:  could totally be wrong about just
0.45%:  think you just learned how to argue science
0.45%:  really should take that job
0.45%:  just thought of a new science related book
0.45%:  clearly need to write a science book or
0.45%:  could be totally wrong about our
0.51%:  could be totally wrong about our entire
0.45%:  forgot about dark theory
0.45%:  should totally get back
1.12%:  should totally get back into
9.75%:  should totally get back into science
4.37%:  should totally get back into science!!
1.14%:  should totally get back into science before
0.58%:  should totally get back into science after
0.51%:  should totally get back into science now
0.45%:  think we should totally go for a
0.45%:  think you just touched on a science
0.45%:  hate to break the news to all of
3.35%:  hate to break the news to all of science
4.72%:  hate to break the news to all of science but
1.37%:  hate to break the news to all of you but
0.79%:  hate to break the news to all of science but you
0.52%:  hate to break the news to all of science but your
0.45%:  think we just found truth
0.45%:  do not care

0.46%:  do not care about your
0.79%:  do not care about your science
0.45%:  wonder if science
0.45%:  could be wrong about another science
0.85%:  could be wrong about another science theory
0.67%:  could be wrong about another science theory!!
0.45%:  wrote that book and
0.45%:  thought you were into science but
0.45%:  should totally write a book about current
5.50%:  should totally write a book about current science
0.45%:  just thought of a science lecture idea
0.68%:  just thought of a science lecture idea!!
0.45%:  hate to break it to you but we should
0.45%:  should totally go work for science
0.45%:  just broke the world!!
0.45%:  just thought about science for once and
0.45%:  could be wrong about the rest of science in
0.45%:  think you just got the real science of
0.45%:  just thought of a really bad counter
0.45%:  should write a book about the science you
0.45%:  thought you were just a doctor
0.45%:  think you just got the science down
0.45%:  think you should get a science fact
0.45%:  can feel the truth
0.45%:  think we just created science out of our
0.45%:  thought you were just nice
0.45%:  could not think
4.06%:  could not think of a better theory
1.20%:  could not think of a better science
1.08%:  could not think of a better use
0.95%:  could not think of a better way to be
0.88%:  could not think of a better re
0.87%:  could not think of a better science theory

0.54%:  could not think of a better theory!!
0.53%:  could not think of a better way to argue
0.48%:  could not think of a worse theory
0.45%:  totally figured out where
0.45%:  just got called out for science theory
0.45%:  thought about it real
0.45%:  just got hit by the science truck!!
0.45%:  forgot to think about what science
0.45%:  totally just ruined the
0.45%:  totally forgot about science until
0.45%:  just need to figure out how to h
0.45%:  feel like you just won the science gold
0.45%:  think you just rewrote all the science bro
0.45%:  thought you cared about science as well!!
0.45%:  forgot to tell you where
0.45%:  would argue that they are still
0.45%:  totally forgot to include the science
0.45%:  think we just found a real theory
0.45%:  really should write that science book one
0.45%:  just got idea
1.16%:  just got idea for science
0.97%:  just got idea for science career
0.74%:  just got idea for a science
0.72%:  just got idea for a new theory
0.63%:  just got idea for new

0.54%:  just got idea for new book!!
0.51%:  just got idea for new science career
0.45%:  think we can all agree science
0.84%:  think we can all agree science just
0.45%:  just thought of an anal
0.45%:  really think we should go after
0.45%:  would like to teach
0.45%:  was trying to be
0.45%:  should get a science book written by a
0.45%:  was about to tell you there
0.45%:  should totally be a science writer for once!!
0.45%:  think that could be one
0.45%:  just figured out how to h
0.45%:  think you just rewrote the science of cel
0.45%:  need to figure out how to talk science all
0.45%:  just got a new idea for lunch
0.45%:  think you just got all the science award for
0.45%:  need to go throw
0.45%:  just thought of it you
0.45%:  hate it when you talk about science for
0.45%:  need science to figure out what colour that
0.45%:  do not like your
0.45%:  do not like your face
0.45%:  refuse to debate with
0.45%:  hate to break it to you but we all
0.45%:  just got a new theory for science bro
0.45%:  just thought of it and science
0.45%:  totally just figured out the law
0.45%:  totally just figured the
0.49%:  totally just figured the whole
0.45%:  could write a book on that science
0.45%:  just figured out how science can be totally real
0.45%:  thought you were about science!!
0.45%:  should totally write a book about un
0.45%:  just figured out what a lot
0.45%:  forgot about the cold
0.45%:  think we just created an
0.45%:  need to go back to your
0.45%:  just figured out not only the whole
0.45%:  thought you were all about science facts not
0.45%:  will go to
0.70%:  will go to the science
0.45%:  really should write a book on the
2.17%:  really should write a book on the science
0.45%:  could get really
3.52%:  could get really into that!!
0.92%:  could get really into that science
0.81%:  could get really into science
0.45%:  could be talking about science for hours here
0.66%:  could be talking about science for hours here!!
0.45%:  totally should write that book before
0.45%:  thought you were science friends but
0.45%:  feel like science just got harder to
0.45%:  just figured out the core science
0.45%:  feel like you could be
0.74%:  feel like you could be onto
0.45%:  was looking for an
0.45%:  think you just got around the
0.45%:  think you just changed science fr
0.45%:  was like
0.68%:  was like totally
0.45%:  need to get back to the science library for
0.45%:  could totally be a science hero
0.50%:  could totally be a science hero!!
0.45%:  need to write a blog about
0.45%:  forgot to look under that
0.45%:  reject that theory too
0.45%:  just went through all of science and you
0.45%:  cannot wait for science to be
0.45%:  would like that to be true oh
0.45%:  just thought of a way science could be like 
0.45%:  should totally write a science teacher book for
0.45%:  thought you were all science facts
0.45%:  really ought to think about science
0.45%:  like the cut of your jet
0.45%:  could really go for a ste
0.45%:  think you just created a better science of
0.45%:  clearly need to take
0.45%:  think you just rewrote all of science to the
0.45%:  totally just got burned
0.45%:  really want dark
0.45%:  just figured out another way to call
0.45%:  think you better watch
0.45%:  just got a new theory for science to think
0.45%:  feel like we just caught
0.45%:  just wrote a science book before lunch!!
0.45%:  think we just got further
0.45%:  just figured out why science took
0.45%:  always thought it could be an
0.45%:  think our science teacher forgot about
0.45%:  should write a book for science that
0.45%:  could be wrong about the truth of science
0.45%:  would like that to be science fact so
0.45%:  just figured out the new
1.57%:  just figured out the new theory
0.45%:  just figured that out when
0.45%:  really should get on
0.52%:  really should get on that science
0.45%:  just had a new
1.63%:  just had a new theory
11.34%:  just had a new theory about
4.04%:  just had a new theory for
1.61%:  just had a new theory of
1.33%:  just had a new theory of science
0.65%:  just had a new theory about science
0.62%:  just had a new theory of science!!
0.45%:  just thought of a new colour to
0.45%:  need to call you later!!
0.45%:  need to figure out how to turn back
0.45%:  hate how you just turned science
0.45%:  feel like you just brought science onto
0.45%:  need to figure out what all the colours
0.45%:  feel like just about
0.45%:  just thought of a science related to
0.45%:  think that could just about
0.45%:  just talked to a science guy!!
0.45%:  just blew your entire science out the back of a
0.45%:  think you just changed all science for a
0.45%:  agree
1.54%:  agree with you for
2.88%:  agree with you for once
2.69%:  agree with you for once!!
1.20%:  agree with you!!
0.45%:  thought for sure science would be able to nail
0.45%:  just need to figure out how to clone
0.45%:  think you just got a real
0.45%:  could totally write a book of these
0.45%:  could totally be working for science
0.45%:  really need to get to work on this science
0.45%:  forgot to include that lo
0.45%:  could talk about science for three
1.20%:  could talk about science for three hours!!
0.63%:  could talk about science for three whole
0.45%:  should totally write one
0.45%:  should write a book about the only real
1.55%:  should write a book about the only real science
0.45%:  need a
0.45%:  would like to say there
0.45%:  think you just cured all of science at the
0.45%:  just figured out how to better science!!
0.45%:  forgot about that theory in
0.45%:  just figured out how to not talk
0.45%:  just got an idea for the book
0.45%:  hate to sound like your
0.45%:  just figured out what a theory
0.45%:  should really go to science
0.49%:  should really go to science con
0.45%:  choose not
0.45%:  already wrote
0.45%:  forgot about the one theory
0.44%:  think you just brought order
0.44%:  think you just fell down a hole
0.44%:  should write a science fact book to
0.44%:  thought you were still a science
0.49%:  thought you were still a science bro
0.44%:  would like to argue that the
0.44%:  really should get back into the
2.32%:  really should get back into the science
0.44%:  just wrote a science book in the
0.44%:  think you just got all of science done!!
0.44%:  think we just found all the science to
0.44%:  just figured out how to beat science at
0.44%:  forgot all about the whole science
0.44%:  think science just won the battle
1.23%:  think science just won the battle for
0.66%:  think science just won the battle for our
0.44%:  clearly need to work on science
0.44%:  just got really into science and
0.44%:  should get back to the lab before
0.44%:  totally forgot about the rules
0.44%:  just figured out how to learn science
0.44%:  like that one better than
0.44%:  only
0.59%:  only thought
1.50%:  only thought about
1.21%:  only thought about dark
0.44%:  hate to be the one to burst your science world
1.80%:  hate to be the one to burst your science world ball
0.44%:  should write a science book but for
0.44%:  just thought of a real counter
0.44%:  just got called out by a science book for
0.44%:  think you just got called out for the
0.44%:  think we all just found your
0.44%:  thought you were out of science cards
0.49%:  thought you were out of science cards!!
0.44%:  think you just caught science
0.44%:  just killed science for the whole
0.44%:  feel like science just got real!!
0.44%:  really just want to be right for the
0.44%:  need to figure out what other science
0.44%:  would like to see your science on
2.63%:  would like to see your science on that!!
0.44%:  thought you were too cute for
1.30%:  thought you were too cute for science
1.02%:  thought you were too cute for science!!
0.44%:  would like you to shut the
0.44%:  forgot to think about outer
0.44%:  was looking at
0.44%:  just figured out the science to all three
0.44%:  wrote that book about
0.44%:  just found a way to be both
1.53%:  just found a way to be both right
0.44%:  just figured out how to enter science
0.44%:  think you just changed real science for our
0.44%:  think we found the secret to your
0.44%:  could be wrong about this but holy freak
0.44%:  think you just rewrote the front
0.44%:  think we just found science to be really
0.67%:  think we just found science to be really cool
0.47%:  think we just found science to be really cool!!
0.44%:  thought you were fake bros until
0.44%:  forgot the whole reason
0.44%:  just found out why
0.44%:  hate that you just broke down
0.44%:  just got hit really

0.44%:  could be wrong on this!!
0.44%:  should buy
0.65%:  should buy a ticket
6.88%:  should buy a ticket to the science
1.15%:  should buy a ticket to that
1.49%:  should buy a ticket to that science
0.54%:  should buy a ticket for
2.60%:  should buy a ticket for that science

0.44%:  just called you out for being a science bro when
0.44%:  totally just broke science and now the
0.44%:  could totally write that book for
1.31%:  could totally write that book for science
0.44%:  think you just rewrote the science about
0.44%:  can just feel the science
0.44%:  could totally be wrong about the science here but for
0.44%:  think we just found both
0.50%:  think we just found both science
0.44%:  feel like that theory just got science
0.44%:  would like to say that the science of
0.44%:  really need to get a
0.47%:  really need to get a job
0.44%:  could totally write a book for the

0.44%:  just thought of a rad science
0.44%:  just wrote a science book for you!!
0.44%:  just figured out how to be a tr
0.44%:  can feel the science world shaking
0.44%:  wonder if the
0.44%:  think we all just agreed to science for
0.44%:  should write a book about all the f
0.44%:  really liked
0.44%:  think you were born just to tell
0.44%:  think you just got all of science to blow
0.44%:  need science to figure that

0.51%:  just got an idea for new science theory
1.16%:  just got an idea for new science theory!!
0.44%:  need to go think about that science
0.44%:  need to talk to other
0.44%:  feel like you just went through science and
0.44%:  would just like to be clear that none
0.47%:  would just like to be clear that none of you
0.44%:  totally just broke down
1.38%:  totally just broke down the science

0.50%:  totally just broke down the fourth
0.44%:  hate that you figured
0.44%:  need to figure out what a
0.44%:  just thought of a way science can be like
0.44%:  need to figure out how to clone

0.44%:  really thought it would be because
0.51%:  really thought it would be because of
0.44%:  think you just forgot to turn
0.44%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to a science
0.44%:  refuse to take your call

0.44%:  would kill
0.56%:  would kill to hear
1.00%:  would kill to hear that
0.49%:  would kill for
1.33%:  would kill for that
32.68%:  would kill for that to be true!!
2.94%:  would kill for that to be the
18.29%:  would kill for that to be the case!!
2.10%:  would kill for that to be true because
2.05%:  would kill for that theory
40.28%:  would kill for that theory to be true!!
1.85%:  would kill for that to be true but
1.16%:  would kill for that to be the case but
0.80%:  would kill for that to be true just
0.44%:  thought science was about to be
0.44%:  thought we talked about science last
0.44%:  think you just blew science out of the arena
0.44%:  feel really good about this joke now
1.11%:  feel really good about this joke now!!

0.64%:  just figured out how to be really cool at science
0.44%:  just totally blew the
0.52%:  just totally blew the roof
0.44%:  just created a science theory that will
0.44%:  was right there
0.44%:  just ruined the
0.44%:  could be wrong about any of that!!
0.44%:  need to talk to the guys
0.56%:  need to talk to the guys who run
1.24%:  need to talk to the guys who run science

0.44%:  think science just got a whole lot of
0.44%:  just think about science all
1.38%:  just think about science all day long!!
0.83%:  just think about science all the
0.44%:  would just like to note here
0.68%:  would just like to note here that science
0.44%:  just thought of a way black
0.44%:  just figured out the total
0.44%:  could be wrong about the other ones!!
0.44%:  think you just rewrote the science for a
0.44%:  forgot to count that in
0.44%:  just felt a chill go
0.44%:  just heard the future

0.44%:  started
0.50%:  started out
0.44%:  could totally see that working out for a
1.81%:  could totally see that working out for a science
0.44%:  just forgot about the entire science
0.44%:  thought we talked about your science
0.44%:  think you just brought down science for real!!

0.44%:  cannot tell whether
0.88%:  cannot tell whether you just
0.44%:  just figured out how to be eternal

0.44%:  used to think you were j
0.44%:  think you just wrote the science for
0.44%:  could be wrong but this
0.44%:  could be wrong but this theory
0.44%:  just blew all your science right out of the ocean and
0.44%:  could be wrong about that but it
0.44%:  think we just found the actual science to
0.44%:  totally just learned about science for
0.44%:  just freak
3.16%:  just freaked out about
1.79%:  just freaked out about the

0.43%:  just figured out that one!!
0.43%:  just got all the way to dark
0.43%:  forgot to think about science when
0.43%:  would kill to see
0.67%:  would kill to see that theory
0.48%:  would kill to see that on

0.43%:  feel like you just turned that science
0.43%:  think you just got out
0.43%:  would totally go on

0.43%:  could be totally wrong about the science here just
0.43%:  think we just got science all
0.43%:  totally forgot about the laws
0.43%:  should go to
2.91%:  should go to the library

1.41%:  just got a new theory about the science of dark
0.43%:  could be wrong about all of science but that one
0.43%:  just need to get back to science
0.43%:  just think of all the great
1.05%:  just think of all the great science
0.43%:  can just about feel the
0.56%:  can just about feel the science
0.43%:  need to write a science book just for that

0.43%:  could be wrong about the science but at the
0.43%:  like the sound of both
0.43%:  just found the one theory about
0.43%:  feel like the word
0.43%:  just figured out not only what all the
0.58%:  just figured out not only what all the science
0.43%:  forgot all about science and
0.43%:  think that could be true for
0.43%:  could totally be the first science author
0.43%:  totally just won the debate for
1.52%:  totally just won the debate for science
1.15%:  totally just won the debate for science!!
0.43%:  would like that to be the science fact

0.43%:  think science just got really hot
0.55%:  think science just got really hot for
0.43%:  think you just robbed science of the central
0.43%:  think you just won the science race to
0.43%:  could totally be a science writer for one

0.43%:  thought you were all talk
0.43%:  could be totally right about there
0.43%:  want to be dark
0.43%:  just broke science and now the
0.43%:  would like to be clear that those
0.43%:  would listen
4.74%:  would listen to that theory
2.20%:  would listen to that theory!!
1.99%:  would listen to that theory for
0.72%:  would listen to that lecture

0.43%:  could totally use that!!
0.43%:  feel like the world just got about a tr
0.43%:  thought you were outside
0.43%:  think we just changed science to
0.43%:  just talked about science to
0.43%:  feel like that could just be what

0.61%:  thought you worked in a science
0.60%:  thought you worked in a science lab
0.43%:  just thought of a way our science
0.43%:  should write a book on that one
0.81%:  should write a book on that one!!
0.43%:  just figured out how there can be a
0.43%:  just figured out not only how to be
0.43%:  should go tell the
1.20%:  should go tell the science
0.43%:  already knew
0.49%:  already knew about
0.45%:  already knew about this
0.50%:  already knew about this!!
0.43%:  could be wrong about all three
0.55%:  could be wrong about all three of those!!

0.43%:  should write a science book for to
0.43%:  would not only
0.43%:  just got an idea how
0.43%:  think you just changed real science for better
0.43%:  think you just won the gold for
0.44%:  think you just won the gold for science

0.43%:  should write a book about the only current
0.43%:  should totally write a science book about fr
0.43%:  think you just changed all of science a
0.43%:  could totally write a science book just for the
0.43%:  just thought of a real way
0.43%:  forgot to think about science because

0.52%:  should write a letter to the science book club!!
0.43%:  need to figure out how to say that back
0.43%:  could write a book about all the science just
0.43%:  hate to break it to us
0.43%:  think you need to focus
0.43%:  should totally write a science fact book or
0.43%:  need to write a story for
0.43%:  forgot that the answer could be science!!
0.43%:  think we just found a science theory!!
0.43%:  really just wanted to look through science
0.43%:  will go back
1.07%:  will go back to bed
0.51%:  will go back to the
0.58%:  will go back to the future
0.43%:  feel like that one

0.43%:  would like for that to be true but science
0.43%:  just thought of like twenty science
0.43%:  should write a book for that one
0.66%:  should write a book for that one!!
0.43%:  just figured out a new science
1.55%:  just figured out a new science theory
2.61%:  just figured out a new science theory!!
0.86%:  just figured out a new science theory that
0.43%:  really need to write science books!!
0.43%:  think you just created a science blog worth
0.43%:  just figured out what to be
0.43%:  totally forgot to answer the dark

0.43%:  get to
0.43%:  just got hit by a truck and
0.43%:  totally forgot about the world
0.43%:  just figured out what all the science con

0.43%:  can just feel science
0.43%:  just talked to science
0.43%:  thought you liked science facts but
0.43%:  think that could really
0.83%:  think that could really be true
0.43%:  should get back to you in
1.07%:  should get back to you in about
0.54%:  should get back to you in about three
0.43%:  thought it could be true
0.43%:  just noticed that you were
0.43%:  just thought of a way to kill science and
0.43%:  could be totally wrong about the science if
0.43%:  could be talking to you
0.43%:  forgot the best
0.43%:  thought you were real science bros but
0.43%:  should tell you about that
0.43%:  think you just brought all of science to bear to
0.43%:  really should write out
0.43%:  think that could just about be science
0.43%:  could be wrong about this but okay
0.43%:  hate to break this to you but science would
0.43%:  forgot about it
0.42%:  just got a new idea for the science
0.42%:  think you were just born to tell
0.42%:  think we found the real source
0.42%:  just wrote the science
0.42%:  was right about you
0.42%:  forgot all about this other
0.42%:  just figured out not only all the
1.07%:  just figured out not only all the science
0.42%:  think we need
1.15%:  think we need to call
0.96%:  think we need to go
0.69%:  think we need to call science
1.12%:  think we need to call science about
0.51%:  think we need to start
0.42%:  could be a science genius after
0.42%:  just fell down the rabbit hole about
0.42%:  really need to track
0.42%:  feel like you just wrote that science
0.42%:  do not care what you
0.59%:  do not care what you think
0.61%:  do not care what you think about
0.42%:  do not care what you just
0.42%:  thought you could not
0.42%:  like you!!
0.42%:  would argue that if that
0.42%:  thought you were just a friend to all
0.42%:  would look into that further because science
0.42%:  would not be at
0.42%:  reject that theory for now
0.42%:  forgot you were around
0.42%:  just thought of a new book to buy!!
0.42%:  just figured that out now!!
0.42%:  need to figure out how to let
0.42%:  should get back to you on that in about
0.42%:  would like that to be the case but only
0.42%:  clearly need to write science books about
0.42%:  think you just cleared science for
0.42%:  really do
0.56%:  really do think
0.52%:  really do think about
0.42%:  just figured out how to create real science
0.42%:  really ought to know about this science
0.42%:  really need to talk to a
0.42%:  would like that science to be taught
0.42%:  think you just won science or
0.42%:  forgot about that one but
0.42%:  think you just won all the science debate club
0.42%:  just freaked out at
0.42%:  think you just won the science battle before
0.42%:  feel a
0.70%:  feel a little
0.42%:  should get on

0.42%:  hate to be racist but you
0.42%:  really should work on that
0.42%:  think you just turned that
0.42%:  just thought of a new science you
0.42%:  would like that one to
0.66%:  would like that one to be true so
0.61%:  would like that one to be true!!
0.46%:  would like that one to be real

0.42%:  really thought it could
0.42%:  really just got owned
0.42%:  think you just cured all of the science!!
0.42%:  clearly need to start science
1.98%:  clearly need to start science blog
0.42%:  just figured out how to be real!!
0.42%:  can think of about three
0.42%:  think you just changed science to be better
0.76%:  think you just changed science to be better for
0.42%:  would like to say that for
0.42%:  think you just brought science fact down a
0.42%:  think you just lowered the bar of science to
0.42%:  really like the word
0.42%:  just thought of actual
4.39%:  just thought of actual science
1.12%:  just thought of actual science to
0.91%:  just thought of actual science!!
0.59%:  just thought of actual science and
0.42%:  really thought we settled
0.42%:  always thought it could be broken
0.42%:  need to start working at
0.42%:  should totally go write that book
0.43%:  should totally go write that book!!
0.42%:  hate it when science totally fuck
0.42%:  thought you were for real until
0.42%:  would rather not talk

0.42%:  just won the science battle of the year
0.42%:  totally forgot about the science answer
1.04%:  totally forgot about the science answer!!
0.42%:  could be wrong about this only
0.42%:  just found out where all the black
0.42%:  should go write a science book that
0.42%:  would like that to be fact
0.46%:  would like that to be factual science
0.42%:  thought science was about to finally
0.42%:  think we all just agreed to science for once

0.42%:  just got called out by a science bro on the
0.42%:  just need to go back to the library now
0.42%:  should look into that later
0.42%:  should write a science lecture book that only
0.42%:  think we just turned science theory
0.42%:  went
1.69%:  went through
0.71%:  went through all of
1.71%:  went through all of science
1.32%:  went through all of science just
1.14%:  went through all of science just to be

0.42%:  found out
0.91%:  found out about
0.43%:  found out about this
1.08%:  found out about this theory
0.42%:  thought for certain you were done
0.42%:  need to start talking about science before
0.42%:  should not
0.42%:  just got called out by another science bro for
0.42%:  should totally write out
0.42%:  really need to get back into science bros!!
0.42%:  think science just got all the way around
0.42%:  just figured out how to be not
0.53%:  just figured out how to be not only
0.42%:  need to think about how great

0.41%:  bet you thought science was all
1.84%:  bet you thought science was all about
0.41%:  just talked to the
1.24%:  just talked to the future
1.10%:  just talked to the future!!
0.41%:  thought you were all about science based
0.41%:  feel like we could both

0.41%:  just created a theory about how
0.41%:  figured out the source
0.41%:  think you just brought down a lot
5.61%:  think you just brought down a lot of science
0.76%:  think you just brought down a lot of science!!
0.41%:  could be wrong about all the science but the rest
0.41%:  need to talk to the other guys
0.41%:  think we just found the cut
0.41%:  think you just brought all of science to bear down
0.41%:  would like to see that on the front
0.41%:  just fell down a rabbit hole onto the

0.41%:  need to go back to the library for science!!
0.41%:  totally need to figure out who just
0.41%:  just figured out how to relate science to all

0.41%:  just won the debate!!
0.41%:  think you just rolled
0.41%:  think you just changed all our science to
0.41%:  reject that on
10.10%:  reject that on the grounds of science

0.92%:  reject that on the grounds of science but will
0.75%:  reject that on grounds
1.08%:  reject that on grounds of science
0.41%:  kinda just thought of a science
0.41%:  really need to think about other
0.41%:  should get on that before
0.41%:  just got idea for a new theory!!
0.41%:  just wrote science fact
0.41%:  just blew all our energy science

0.41%:  think you just got the science reward
0.41%:  should get a book
0.41%:  think you just blew all of our other
0.55%:  think you just blew all of our other science
0.41%:  hate to break it to all the science d

0.41%:  found the one
0.41%:  could be totally wrong about the science just
0.41%:  think you just drew
0.41%:  just blew all our science right the
0.41%:  could totally be a science hero right
0.47%:  could totally be a science hero right now but
0.41%:  think you just dec
0.41%:  like that theory a
1.61%:  like that theory a lot!!
0.41%:  hate to sound like a science
4.48%:  hate to sound like a science bro but
1.03%:  hate to sound like a science bro but that
0.81%:  hate to sound like a science bro but holy
0.44%:  hate to sound like a science bro here

0.41%:  hate to be the one to call
0.41%:  hate you for knowing that just
0.41%:  kinda forgot about that when

0.41%:  think you just brought forward one
0.41%:  really screw
0.41%:  always forget to think

0.41%:  know you just called
0.41%:  think we found a better
1.21%:  think we found a better theory
0.41%:  would like you to start
0.41%:  just thought of a way all science
1.30%:  just thought of a way all science could
0.43%:  just thought of a way all science could be broken
0.41%:  need to write a book of all
0.41%:  finally get
0.41%:  just figured out a way to both be
0.41%:  thought you were like science
0.41%:  could be wrong about all the science so
2.22%:  could be wrong about all the science so far!!
0.73%:  could be wrong about all the science so far but
0.41%:  wrote a science book that
0.41%:  just thought of a brand new science to be
0.41%:  think we just got science really
0.41%:  choose to ignore your
0.41%:  think you just brought science and cart
0.41%:  really wrote that book just
0.41%:  feel like that could just be your
0.41%:  like the sound of science better

0.41%:  just thought of an entire world
0.41%:  just blew your brain out of the
0.41%:  really just want to talk
0.41%:  think science just found out how to get really

0.41%:  forgot you can
0.41%:  just got a theory of
0.41%:  would be okay
0.41%:  could totally go for science

0.41%:  could totally be the first author
0.41%:  just forgot to breathe while you
0.41%:  think science just got really far

0.41%:  should write a science book to tell you
0.41%:  could write a science book full
0.41%:  just blew science right outta
0.64%:  just blew science right outta the freak
0.41%:  just thought of a new science role
0.41%:  think you just argued better science
0.41%:  totally forgot that could be science!!
0.41%:  clearly need to write that science book!!
0.41%:  know because
0.41%:  really need to figure out how to obsc
0.41%:  just got a science boner without
0.41%:  gotta find out where you
0.41%:  just called you out for talking science when there
0.41%:  forgot to tell you about the science behind
0.41%:  would like that to be true for real
0.41%:  totally want
0.54%:  totally want to be
0.41%:  like how you brought science to
0.41%:  need to figure out a way to turn
0.41%:  think you just got called out for a
0.41%:  just figured out another way black
0.41%:  just created a new theory of science on
0.41%:  could be wrong about the science but let
0.41%:  just figured out the only other
0.41%:  need to think about why
0.41%:  need to start working at a science
0.41%:  need to figure out how to roll that
0.41%:  need to write that theory
0.41%:  just need to figure out what other
0.41%:  just thought of a cool idea

0.48%:  just got turned on to a science
1.03%:  just got turned on to a science theory
0.55%:  just got turned on to a science theory for
0.41%:  think we just created science theory for
0.41%:  think you just got real real science
0.41%:  can feel your
0.41%:  just think you
0.41%:  was looking for that!!
0.41%:  just wrote science fan
0.41%:  think you could just be
0.41%:  would like that to be a real
0.87%:  would like that to be a real theory
0.65%:  would like that to be a real theory!!
0.41%:  just got idea for a new science theory
0.87%:  just got idea for a new science theory!!
0.41%:  hate to break the bad news to you but science
0.41%:  think you just got science hard!!

0.79%:  think you should get an actual science job before
0.78%:  think you should get an actual job
0.58%:  think you should get an actual science job for
0.41%:  could talk about this theory for a
0.93%:  could talk about this theory for a long
0.41%:  think that could just be science!!
0.41%:  get it
0.62%:  get it now!!
0.41%:  just hit the science
0.72%:  just hit the science lot
0.41%:  need to go think about that for way
0.41%:  could totally see that working for other
0.51%:  could totally see that working for other science
0.41%:  really need to think about how to react
0.41%:  forgot about science and reality

0.40%:  would like to hang out there for a sec
0.40%:  forgot to rule out the absurd
0.40%:  think we all just agreed that you
0.40%:  should write a letter to science guy about
0.40%:  would rather you not think
0.40%:  just got turned on to a science theory!!
0.40%:  totally just broke the science world!!
0.40%:  just thought of a way to retro

0.40%:  just bought a ticket on
0.48%:  just bought a ticket on the science
0.40%:  gotta call the science news
0.40%:  could be wrong about all the science there
0.40%:  just forgot to include that one
0.40%:  clearly need to look into that
2.10%:  clearly need to look into that further
3.10%:  clearly need to look into that further!!
0.48%:  clearly need to look into that!!
0.40%:  think we just created a theory of science all
0.96%:  think we just created a theory of science all our
0.40%:  just got a new theory for the science book
0.40%:  just got a science boner for once
0.40%:  think that just got real
0.40%:  would be the first to call you a
0.40%:  just blew your science right out of the balloon
0.40%:  think you just created science where
0.40%:  could be wrong about all the science here but it
0.40%:  could talk about the science of the
0.40%:  need to get to the science library for
0.40%:  could write a science blog about these
0.40%:  should totally be a science writer on
0.40%:  think you just found a science where
0.40%:  forgot all about this theory but
0.40%:  really think we just found our science
0.40%:  thought you cared about real science like
0.40%:  need to go to the library to learn science
0.40%:  thought you went
0.88%:  thought you went to science
0.40%:  forgot to think that
0.40%:  just got a new theory before
0.40%:  totally just found out what science
0.40%:  need to talk to the science bros!!

0.40%:  forgot to tell you that we
0.40%:  dun
0.40%:  hate to burst your balloon but if dark
0.40%:  really should write a science book for once

0.40%:  need to figure out how to back out
0.40%:  need to figure out how to crush science
0.40%:  hate you for knowing that better
0.40%:  hate to be the one to burst our
0.78%:  hate to be the one to burst our dark
0.40%:  really need to think about the science for
0.40%:  should be the one to write science fact
0.40%:  thought science was fake
0.58%:  thought science was fake too but
0.40%:  think our science teacher just told
0.40%:  really should get back to science before it
0.40%:  think you just caught a science
0.40%:  think science just got really real for about two
0.40%:  really think we just found out the science
0.40%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but it
0.40%:  just thought of a really cool new science!!
0.40%:  just thought of a really bad science lecture
0.40%:  just figured out how to be the only science bro
0.40%:  would like for that to be the case but no
0.40%:  wrote that book for
1.11%:  wrote that book for nothing
0.80%:  wrote that book for nothing!!
0.58%:  wrote that book for science
0.40%:  could be wrong about a lot of the science in there
0.89%:  could be wrong about a lot of the science in there but

0.40%:  think you just found two
0.40%:  think we just reached
0.40%:  clearly should
0.40%:  just thought of a black
0.40%:  thought science was about to let

0.40%:  could write a science book about the only
0.40%:  thought you were just like a
0.40%:  just totally forgot how dark
0.40%:  really like the sound of that now
0.40%:  would hug you for this

0.40%:  just thought of a new article about
0.40%:  call that the
0.40%:  want that to be true so bad you
0.40%:  need to talk to science about how
0.40%:  think you could just be onto

0.40%:  just thought of a double
0.40%:  thought about it and now
0.40%:  would like to go on the science
0.40%:  think you found the actual science
0.40%:  really ought to look
0.40%:  refuse to be the
0.40%:  tried

0.40%:  think we both just learned
0.68%:  think we both just learned about
2.99%:  think we both just learned about science
1.92%:  think we both just learned about science!!
0.85%:  think we both just learned about science for
0.40%:  sure would like to be a
0.40%:  could totally get into science for
0.40%:  should write a science fact blog

0.40%:  totally need to go back in
0.40%:  just got turned on by science for a while
4.70%:  just got turned on by science for a while there!!
0.40%:  just thought of a way better science
0.40%:  just got a new theory of science called
0.40%:  could be wrong about all that other junk
0.40%:  should write the science
0.40%:  would like to be the last guy
0.40%:  really should know about the
1.93%:  really should know about the science
5.64%:  really should know about the science before

0.40%:  think you just clar
0.40%:  just got science fact and
0.40%:  just figured out not only how all
0.58%:  just figured out not only how all science
0.43%:  just figured out not only how all the
0.52%:  just figured out not only how all the science
0.40%:  can think of a better word to
0.40%:  just got another idea for the
0.40%:  should totally get a job where
0.40%:  feel like we just got a lot
0.40%:  just thought of one way dark

0.40%:  could write a book on the science of the
0.40%:  kinda just thought of a new
0.41%:  kinda just thought of a new science
0.40%:  really thought about it for a second but no
0.40%:  think you should get on
0.40%:  just think of all the cool

0.40%:  think you just rewrote the end
1.42%:  think you just rewrote the end of science
0.53%:  think you just rewrote the end of science!!

0.50%:  refuse to think about all the science
0.39%:  feel like that would count as a
0.39%:  just figured that one out too
0.39%:  should write a book about science totally
0.39%:  thought you said before
0.39%:  thought you were real friends but
0.39%:  could totally write a science book one
0.39%:  just figured out how to talk to ner
0.39%:  thought it was already

0.39%:  think we just changed our science for
0.39%:  really just want to go back to bed for
0.39%:  just thought of a cool idea!!
0.39%:  should write a book about the utterly
0.39%:  just thought of a new science career and
0.39%:  think you just wrote a real science fact
0.39%:  really can
0.39%:  just got turned into the
0.39%:  would like that to be the future science

0.39%:  think science just found a real
0.39%:  think science just got called out for not
0.39%:  could totally be right about just
0.39%:  just thought of one too
0.39%:  hate you for that but
0.39%:  forgot about that but now you
0.39%:  should write a book of science!!
0.39%:  would like to start a science club for the

0.39%:  just got talked out of a really
0.39%:  would like to see the science that conf
0.39%:  think we found the true source
0.39%:  take that theory
0.39%:  just thought of a new science book title and you
0.39%:  feel like that should be your science
0.39%:  forgot that was the
0.39%:  need to follow that guy
0.39%:  could be wrong about all the science for one
0.39%:  hate you for this
0.39%:  really ought to write a science book!!
0.39%:  think science just got real real
0.39%:  could totally be on the wrong
0.39%:  think you just rewrote the science of gal
0.39%:  need to go think about these
0.39%:  should totally be working on that for

1.99%:  really wanted to be right
3.69%:  really wanted to be right about the
2.83%:  really wanted to be right for
24.78%:  really wanted to be right for once!!
5.43%:  really wanted to be right for once but
2.77%:  really wanted to be right for once about
0.49%:  really wanted to talk
0.44%:  really wanted to be right but
0.38%:  think you just rewrote all science bro
0.38%:  could be wrong about all the other tiny
0.38%:  think we all just found a better science to
0.38%:  would like to be your science teacher for just
0.38%:  think you just created our new science for
0.38%:  think you just laughed at science!!
0.38%:  only just figured that out when
0.38%:  thought you were into science fact
0.38%:  thought it was a joke but
0.38%:  think we just got real science for the
0.38%:  need to go work on science
0.38%:  just got another science theory
0.38%:  just figured out what all non
0.38%:  think you just got all the real
2.41%:  think you just got all the real science
0.55%:  think you just got all the real science bro
0.41%:  think you just got all the real science for
0.38%:  would like to argue that such
0.38%:  would totally get a
0.38%:  should be working
1.80%:  should be working on that
0.38%:  will start
0.38%:  think you found the worst
0.59%:  think you found the worst science
0.38%:  was looking for science
0.38%:  just wrote an entire book of science that could
0.38%:  can get behind that science
0.43%:  can get behind that science!!
0.38%:  think you should get science
0.38%:  forgot that the only
0.38%:  really do think that
0.38%:  really need to go back to the start
0.38%:  just figured out how to break all
1.95%:  just figured out how to break all the science
1.03%:  just figured out how to break all science
0.78%:  just figured out how to break all the science!!
0.38%:  thought you were on our
1.20%:  thought you were on our side!!
0.38%:  just blew all our science right out of the back end!!
0.38%:  think you just brought all of science a
0.38%:  think you just forgot about science!!
0.38%:  forgot about all the science you learned in
0.38%:  think you just brought down all of science better
0.38%:  clearly need to be
0.38%:  totally just wrote a science book right here and
0.38%:  thought you were bad at science facts
0.38%:  forgot to say that there
0.38%:  think you just caught all
0.91%:  think you just caught all of science
0.38%:  was like totally about
0.38%:  think you just changed out
0.40%:  think you just changed out of science
0.38%:  totally just figured out the science known
0.38%:  should write a book about science but only change
0.38%:  should really get on that science
0.38%:  need to start working for a
2.48%:  need to start working for a science
0.38%:  want to be the
1.01%:  want to be the first guy
0.38%:  should totally be the one to write
1.30%:  should totally be the one to write science
0.38%:  just got turned on by science for a little
0.38%:  used to think you were one
0.38%:  just figured out what science theory to
0.38%:  always forget to tell
0.38%:  forgot about the real answer
0.60%:  forgot about the real answer!!
0.38%:  thought it could only be true
0.47%:  thought it could only be true for a
0.38%:  could be right about all of science
0.38%:  just thought of a way science could re
0.38%:  could totally be right about just one
0.38%:  really wanted to be right for once about science
0.43%:  really wanted to be right for once about science!!
0.38%:  just figured out how to clean the
0.38%:  should write a book about the science but
0.38%:  just gotta
0.38%:  just totally forgot what science
0.38%:  just got an idea for how to cure
0.38%:  would argue they
0.41%:  would argue they are still
1.18%:  would argue they are still fake!!
0.47%:  would argue they are still fake bro
0.41%:  would argue they are still fake but
0.38%:  need to go think about that science for
0.38%:  just created a theory of science with no
0.38%:  just wrote a science article and got
0.38%:  could write that theory
0.38%:  think you just brought science on board for
0.38%:  think you just changed real science to a
0.38%:  feel like science just brought down
1.01%:  feel like science just brought down the cur
0.43%:  feel like science just brought down another
0.38%:  think you just won the science battle for a
0.38%:  think you just agreed that science
0.38%:  think you just created one for
0.38%:  could be wrong about all other science but
0.43%:  could be wrong about all other science but this
0.38%:  think you just rewrote all of science to be able
0.38%:  need to get to the science lab
0.38%:  just figured that one out all on
0.38%:  think our science teacher just got blown
0.40%:  think our science teacher just got blown out
0.38%:  call this one
0.38%:  reject this on
0.38%:  would look into that theory but
0.38%:  forgot about that theory once
0.46%:  forgot about that theory once!!
0.38%:  should write a science theory
1.43%:  should write a science theory book!!
0.54%:  should write a science theory book about
0.45%:  should write a science theory about
0.38%:  just killed science for real!!
0.38%:  just broke down crying there
0.38%:  thought you cared about science first
0.38%:  think you just caught on
0.38%:  think we all just created science!!
0.38%:  think you just rewrote the natural
0.38%:  think you just won a debate for science!!
0.38%:  forgot to think about how science
0.38%:  just found out there are two other
0.38%:  just got better at science for real!!
0.38%:  should write a science book about counter
0.38%:  could be the first one to know
0.72%:  could be the first one to know about
0.38%:  figured that one out on
0.38%:  think that would be a great
0.38%:  just really
0.38%:  just created a science theory about how
0.38%:  could write books about that science!!
0.38%:  could write a book on that science theory
0.63%:  could write a book on that science theory!!
0.38%:  like the sound of that science bro
0.38%:  hate to break it to you science world but
0.38%:  just got another science idea
0.86%:  just got another science idea!!
0.38%:  would like to hear about that!!
0.38%:  totally know that
0.38%:  could totally be wrong for the rest
0.38%:  feel the ground
0.38%:  feel the ground shake
0.38%:  just got all the way into
0.38%:  just got all science theory
0.38%:  just looked at
0.41%:  just looked at the night
0.38%:  hate to break this to future
1.04%:  hate to break this to future science
0.38%:  only just figured out where the
0.38%:  think you just found the tr
0.38%:  refuse to allow that to be science!!
0.38%:  just blew all our current
1.80%:  just blew all our current science
0.38%:  could totally write a book about just
0.38%:  totally forgot about the science rules
0.38%:  could be wrong about the science there but still
0.38%:  think you just learned about science there!!
0.38%:  totally forgot about the word
0.38%:  forgot about that and you blew
0.38%:  clearly need to write a science book on
0.38%:  should totally write a book on the future
0.45%:  should totally write a book on the future science
0.38%:  just figured out how to back
0.38%:  would like to go there!!
0.38%:  just thought of a way to be called
0.38%:  hate to burst your bucket
0.38%:  clearly need to write a science book soon
0.68%:  clearly need to write a science book soon!!
0.38%:  hate to break it to you fellow ner
1.09%:  hate to break it to you fellow nerds but
0.38%:  could not think of a better seg
0.38%:  just got a new theory for science that could
0.38%:  thought you were real for a sec
0.38%:  hate to tell you what science
0.38%:  really think that could be our best bet
0.57%:  really think that could be our best bet for
0.38%:  just figured out the three
0.38%:  just talked about science out
0.38%:  really just thought it
0.38%:  just figured out how to be both real
0.38%:  thought of it too
0.38%:  think you just further
0.38%:  just broke the fourth wall on
0.45%:  just broke the fourth wall on you
0.38%:  just figured out how they all
0.38%:  should look into that science
0.38%:  refuse to look at
0.43%:  refuse to look at the
1.48%:  refuse to look at the science
2.78%:  refuse to look at the science behind
2.34%:  refuse to look at the science behind your
0.42%:  refuse to look at that
0.38%:  would like to hear about that science
0.38%:  could talk about this non
0.38%:  really thought about it for a second but now
0.38%:  need to figure out how to absorb all the science
0.38%:  feel like that counts
0.38%:  just totally figured out what 
0.38%:  totally need to look
0.38%:  just had like three
0.38%:  just thought of a science book to read
0.58%:  just thought of a science book to read!!
0.38%:  forgot about that and you just
2.59%:  forgot about that and you just blew
0.38%:  feel like you just went through a ton
0.38%:  thought about it before and
0.38%:  really need to figure out how to clar
0.38%:  just figured out that 
0.38%:  feel like science just got a whole bunch d
0.38%:  just got a science boner for you!!
0.38%:  think you just forced a
0.38%:  just got called out by a science bro for the
0.38%:  looked through
0.38%:  should go back to the
0.73%:  should go back to the library
0.38%:  could totally write a science book of
0.38%:  just thought of a new science book deal
0.38%:  think science just got rad
0.38%:  just figured out both where
0.38%:  thought you wanted to be real science
0.63%:  thought you wanted to be real science bro
0.77%:  thought you wanted to be real science bros!!

0.38%:  should write a science lecture for you
0.38%:  think they just got real!!
0.38%:  really should get to work on the
0.69%:  really should get to work on the science
0.38%:  think you just elected
0.38%:  just got a bunch of dark
0.38%:  think you just brought all of science down cr
0.38%:  just got hit by a science truck of
0.38%:  need to figure out how to be a
0.70%:  need to figure out how to be a science
0.38%:  would like that to be the case for science to
0.38%:  think you found out what science
0.38%:  just thought of a cooler
0.38%:  think you were born for
0.53%:  think you were born for science
0.38%:  just found the weak
0.38%:  always forget about the non
0.38%:  think you were just born to science the
0.38%:  just figured out how to create another science
0.38%:  hate to break the news to all of you science
0.41%:  hate to break the news to all of you science bro
0.38%:  think you just got science done
0.38%:  should totally get into
2.58%:  should totally get into science
1.74%:  should totally get into science!!
0.46%:  should totally get into science before
0.38%:  hate it when science turns
29.96%:  hate it when science turns out to be real
74.56%:  hate it when science turns out to be real!!
1.87%:  hate it when science turns out to be real for
1.36%:  hate it when science turns out to be really

0.38%:  think you just cured all science wrong
0.38%:  would say there
0.38%:  really just figured out how to be
0.38%:  just blew science right the
0.38%:  should get a science job
0.38%:  forgot to tell the
0.38%:  just got totally science fact
0.38%:  would argue that science has
0.38%:  think you just won the science lecture gold
0.38%:  just found the science
0.38%:  figured you out!!
0.38%:  thought science was for ner
0.38%:  just got all the way to the end of a science book
0.38%:  legit
0.44%:  legit just
0.38%:  think we could all just
0.90%:  think we could all just agree
1.03%:  think we could all just agree that science
0.97%:  think we could all just agree to
0.43%:  think we could all just agree that you
0.38%:  only just figured out how to breathe
0.38%:  think you just ner
0.38%:  could totally get a
0.44%:  could totally get a science
0.38%:  should tell you that before
0.38%:  think you just got science on the face
0.38%:  just figured out how to tell an
0.38%:  think you just enabled
0.38%:  forgot about this science
0.38%:  think that would be cool
0.38%:  should totally get on that!!
0.37%:  can totally get behind that joke
0.64%:  can totally get behind that joke!!
0.37%:  think you just blew the science door
0.37%:  could be wrong about science for the only
0.37%:  just figured out where all the bat
0.37%:  need to go think about how science just
0.37%:  forgot that you were a science bro and
0.37%:  need to figure out how to take science
0.37%:  hate you for doing science
0.37%:  just got yelled at for science!!
0.37%:  think you just got science for real!!
0.37%:  forgot about the real dark
0.37%:  feel like you just burned
0.37%:  think he just called you
0.37%:  always thought if
0.37%:  think we found a real
0.37%:  think you just got all of the science down

0.37%:  do not like how
0.37%:  cannot wait for you
0.46%:  cannot wait for you to tell
0.37%:  just wrote a book about science

0.37%:  totally said
1.01%:  totally said that before
0.96%:  totally said that before!!
0.37%:  need to figure out how to rule
0.37%:  should write a science fan
0.37%:  really should get back on

0.75%:  totally just broke the whole science
0.39%:  totally just broke the whole science of
0.37%:  think you are about to get
0.37%:  think we should tell science about you
0.37%:  forgot that science was real
0.37%:  could see
8.91%:  could see that working

0.37%:  feel like you just brought science too hard at
0.37%:  was about to tell you to
0.37%:  just found out we
0.37%:  should write a book about only science
0.37%:  just got totally out
0.37%:  forgot to rule out the dark
0.37%:  really should write a book about counter
0.37%:  hate to break this to you gentle
0.37%:  forgot about all that other junk science you
0.54%:  forgot about all that other junk science you were
0.37%:  think we need to get
0.37%:  always forget about outer
0.37%:  just thought of an ultra
0.37%:  could be wrong about this but really
0.37%:  think we just changed science bro!!
0.37%:  think that could be our new best
0.37%:  like the sound of that about
0.37%:  should write a book about real science for
0.37%:  just figured out where all the k
0.37%:  created
0.37%:  think we should totally go science
0.37%:  really should know better than to argue science out
0.37%:  think our science teacher just got a
0.37%:  just thought of a related
0.37%:  thought you were a science fan but
0.37%:  just need to figure out how to tell black
0.37%:  need to borrow your black

0.37%:  just feel
1.57%:  just feel like that
2.27%:  just feel like that would
0.48%:  just feel like you
0.48%:  just feel like that theory

0.46%:  just feel like that would be too
0.44%:  just feel like that would be a
0.39%:  just feel like you could
0.37%:  could be wrong about the science history
0.37%:  wasn
0.37%:  think you just got down
0.37%:  really just thought of a better
0.37%:  should totally be a science book
6.86%:  should totally be a science book author!!

0.37%:  think for once you just blew
0.37%:  could talk about science for a
0.63%:  could talk about science for a long
0.58%:  could talk about science for a whole
0.37%:  would kill for that theory!!
0.37%:  think you just wrote one
1.10%:  think you just wrote one of the great
25.24%:  think you just wrote one of the great science
0.37%:  think science just found a theory

0.37%:  told you those were fake!!
0.37%:  just called you out for knowing science
0.46%:  just called you out for knowing science better
0.37%:  need to call science right now about

0.36%:  should write a book about you!!
0.36%:  feel like you just brought down an
0.36%:  could totally see that working for science bro
0.36%:  think we could all use
0.36%:  just figured out how to beat all the science ner
0.36%:  just got the c
0.36%:  was right there!!
0.36%:  bet you thought science could
0.88%:  bet you thought science could answer
0.70%:  bet you thought science could answer all of
0.36%:  always thought it could be rob
0.36%:  should write a blog entry about that for
0.94%:  should write a blog entry about that for science
0.36%:  just got hit by the science bullet and now
0.36%:  just wrote a science book for d
0.36%:  forgot all about that weird
1.31%:  forgot all about that weird theory
0.94%:  forgot all about that weird theory!!
0.36%:  like how that totally
0.36%:  need to get back to science for
1.78%:  need to get back to science for a while!!
0.36%:  need to call science!!
0.36%:  forgot you were such a science bro until
0.36%:  will go to the ends
0.42%:  will go to the ends of science
0.36%:  should really get a better

0.82%:  should really get a better science book
0.37%:  should really get a better job
0.36%:  think you just blew all the science for our
0.36%:  totally forgot that when
0.36%:  like your science better than actual
0.36%:  would hate to think of
0.36%:  could go for a sn
0.36%:  should totally write a science book there
0.39%:  should totally write a science book there!!
0.36%:  refuse to allow science to threat
0.36%:  could be right about all of science!!
0.36%:  think you just threw a science bullet
0.36%:  gotta tell you about dark
0.36%:  should totally get back into science for
0.36%:  forgot this theory!!
0.36%:  think science just told
0.36%:  really should write a book of science that
0.36%:  just wrote a science fact book in
0.36%:  hate to be the one to burst your bal

0.83%:  totally just got an idea for the
0.53%:  totally just got an idea for where
0.36%:  just figured out a whole other
0.36%:  should write a science book but there
0.36%:  really just figured that one out on
0.36%:  just got a new theory before lunch
0.36%:  just got called out by one

0.36%:  totally need to watch
0.36%:  would hug you so
0.36%:  think you just robbed all the fun

0.36%:  really just wanted to figure out a
0.36%:  totally wish
0.36%:  just called you fake without
0.36%:  gotta talk about
0.36%:  need to get out of science!!
0.36%:  really want to be right about there

0.36%:  think you were born just for
0.75%:  think you were born just for that
0.36%:  just totally thought of a new dark
0.36%:  just got called out by science ner

0.36%:  think science just got totally blown
0.36%:  found the lo
0.36%:  could be wrong about it all!!
0.36%:  should be the one talking about science for
0.36%:  think you just cured two
0.51%:  think you just cured two science
0.36%:  totally just broke science with one
0.36%:  think you just created a real science for the
0.36%:  just figured out the role that
0.36%:  totally just found a new
0.36%:  forgot about the current best

0.36%:  forgot about all the science books
0.36%:  reject this theory for now
0.64%:  reject this theory for now but
0.36%:  just wrote a science fact book that
0.36%:  could be talking about science theory but
0.36%:  need to get to work on this!!
0.36%:  think you just altered the current
0.36%:  just need to figure out how that rel
0.36%:  need to get back on the science bus

0.36%:  think we just got real science on
0.41%:  think we just got real science on our
0.36%:  just won the science battle of all
0.36%:  need to figure out how to steal science
0.36%:  think about you
0.36%:  would kill for that to be true because science
0.36%:  really should get to work on a
0.46%:  really should get to work on a science
0.36%:  just legit
0.36%:  think you just rewrote science bro
0.36%:  thought we could talk about science for one
0.36%:  thought you were bro
0.36%:  just figured out why all the science bro
0.36%:  just wrote a science book for the entire
0.36%:  feel like we should both
0.36%:  need to go back to the library for all
4.53%:  need to go back to the library for all the science
0.36%:  think you just wrote out science
0.36%:  think our science just got really real

0.36%:  think you should be a science blog
0.36%:  would like for that to be the best
0.36%:  hate to break the news but your science
0.36%:  just wrote that book!!
0.36%:  need to get back to the library so
0.36%:  should write a science lecture for the
0.36%:  forgot another
0.36%:  could be wrong about all of the science but at
0.36%:  think you just got the science reward for
0.36%:  should buy a ticket to science
0.36%:  could be talking about science theory here
0.49%:  could be talking about science theory here!!
0.36%:  just noticed you left
0.36%:  would kill for that to be the reason
0.36%:  think you just changed all our science fore

0.35%:  just thought of a non
0.35%:  just blew your science right out the back and
0.35%:  would like for you to be
0.35%:  just blew all our science out of orbit
0.35%:  think you need to start
0.35%:  like you for
0.35%:  thought you were lost
0.35%:  just broke through science to reality!!
0.35%:  totally should be working on that science
0.35%:  could totally go for an
0.35%:  think you just created the new science for our
0.35%:  would rate that as
0.35%:  just figured out how to beat all other science ner

0.35%:  hate to break it to you but such
0.35%:  would like to note that these

0.41%:  think we all just found the science to our
0.35%:  can totally get into
0.35%:  forgot about that lo
0.35%:  should totally write a book about science f
0.35%:  just got a really bad
0.35%:  just watched you
0.35%:  figured out the true
0.35%:  should get to
1.51%:  should get to the library

0.35%:  just had a full
0.35%:  forgot that there is
0.35%:  just went out
0.35%:  would just like to be clear on
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science on these

0.35%:  need to borrow your black light
0.35%:  think we both just got science
0.35%:  forgot to include al
0.35%:  clearly need to write a science book so
0.35%:  should write a book out
0.35%:  want to hug you so bad but
0.35%:  would not be able to think
0.35%:  thought you wanted to learn science facts

0.35%:  just found the giant
0.35%:  just got that theory
0.35%:  would buy this book
0.35%:  think you just brought science and all
0.35%:  gotta think about where
0.35%:  think you just changed science for bro
0.35%:  was born to be right
0.35%:  can totally hear
0.35%:  just blew your science out of orbit
0.35%:  totally just thought of a new book deal
0.36%:  totally just thought of a new book deal!!
0.35%:  should talk to you about that
0.35%:  feel like that would be too
0.35%:  really need to figure out how to scrub
0.35%:  could be wrong about their fake
0.35%:  should totally get a job with science
0.35%:  forgot that science could be real!!
0.35%:  think we all just found the true science
0.35%:  call this the
0.35%:  just got the idea for a whole
0.35%:  should write a science fact book real
0.35%:  would like to hang out there!!
0.35%:  think you are both
0.35%:  think you just threw out one
0.35%:  think the science just got really real for about

0.35%:  want to hug you so bad!!
0.35%:  forgot about that theory called
0.35%:  should go to science
0.35%:  would like to say that no
0.35%:  think you just won the battle of science bro
0.35%:  can totally do
0.35%:  kinda forgot about that science
0.35%:  think science just found a whole
0.35%:  totally just broke down the entire
0.52%:  totally just broke down the entire science
0.35%:  feel like that just brought science to
0.35%:  feel like that just brought science to a new
0.35%:  only just figured that out three
0.35%:  could totally see the
0.37%:  could totally see the science
0.48%:  could totally see the science working
0.37%:  could totally see the future
0.35%:  think you just changed all of science to be true to
0.35%:  really forgot about that science
0.35%:  just blew all your science right out of the boat
0.35%:  think you just created the new science!!
0.35%:  need to talk to a grown
0.35%:  need to write a science book that only
0.35%:  really need to get back to science now!!
0.35%:  could be wrong about this one science theory!!
0.35%:  figured out the answer to one
0.35%:  can totally get on board with both
0.35%:  wrote this before you
0.35%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole a
0.35%:  could totally go for a science where
0.35%:  can feel it
0.35%:  thought you were still a science bro!!
0.35%:  just thought of a science way to tell
0.35%:  like you better now that
0.35%:  thought you left dark
0.35%:  do not like where your
0.35%:  think we just bought
0.35%:  think you just got all the science award!!
0.35%:  just killed the science theory
0.35%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but they
0.35%:  could be totally right but
0.35%:  thought you were insult
0.35%:  should really get a job
0.35%:  should write a book about science but there
0.35%:  just got an idea for our
0.35%:  was about to get all
0.35%:  just thought of a new book you
0.35%:  need to go think about how true
0.35%:  really think we found
0.48%:  really think we found out
0.35%:  clearly need to figure out how to talk about science!!
0.35%:  just walked into another
0.35%:  really just thought about a
0.35%:  should write for the science
0.35%:  thought we could talk about science for a bit
0.35%:  could talk about nothing else but science
0.35%:  think you just got science factual
0.35%:  feel like you just won a
0.88%:  feel like you just won a science
0.36%:  feel like you just won a science battle
0.35%:  think you just got all the real science out
0.35%:  think we just heard
0.46%:  think we just heard science
0.35%:  like your cut
0.64%:  like your cut of the science
0.66%:  like your cut of the science dollars
0.35%:  just got all the science to
0.57%:  just got all the science to back
0.35%:  can barely follow that but it
0.35%:  hate to be that guy but science would
0.35%:  think you just rewrote all our science to be
0.35%:  like that better than regular old
0.35%:  reject this theory for not
0.35%:  just took a science theory
0.35%:  need to go to the library to search
0.35%:  just got science harder on
0.82%:  just got science harder on you!!
0.35%:  really just figured out how to talk
0.92%:  really just figured out how to talk science
0.35%:  just walked into a theory
0.35%:  forgot that this could
1.11%:  forgot that this could be true
0.60%:  forgot that this could be science
0.35%:  could write a book of these
0.35%:  think you just cured all science at
0.35%:  would like that to be the case for science!!
0.35%:  want to be a science teacher!!
0.35%:  just got owned by a science article
0.35%:  just broke your
0.50%:  just broke your brain
0.35%:  totally just heard science being
0.35%:  think you just got what
0.35%:  think you just blew science out of the danger
0.35%:  thought of a counter to
0.35%:  think you were just born to be a science educ
0.35%:  totally forgot about the search
0.35%:  really want to go to the
0.49%:  really want to go to the science
0.35%:  reject the notion that science works
0.35%:  forgot that there are still
0.35%:  can totally write science books
0.35%:  just figured out how to relate all
0.87%:  just figured out how to relate all science
0.35%:  would be the first to reject
0.35%:  forgot to eat lunch and
0.35%:  really just want to get
0.74%:  really just want to get back
0.35%:  could write books about that guy
0.35%:  could talk about science for hours right
0.35%:  think we all just agreed on science!!
0.35%:  really just thought about science for too
0.35%:  really just thought about science for like a
0.35%:  could be wrong about that other
0.35%:  could write a science book about the theory
0.35%:  think science just found a hole
0.35%:  just thought of a brand new science book you
0.35%:  think you just got too science for
0.35%:  just found out who
0.35%:  thought we all
0.35%:  would argue that if they
0.35%:  just wrote an entire book about science
0.35%:  just broke the entire world of science you
0.35%:  think you can
0.35%:  do not recall asking
0.77%:  do not recall asking for your
0.61%:  do not recall asking for your science
0.55%:  do not recall asking for science
0.35%:  should totally get out
0.41%:  should totally get out of science
0.35%:  should be talking about science theory
0.35%:  really hate to be wrong but that
0.35%:  really ought to write those
0.35%:  would just like to note that our
0.35%:  just blew all the science right out of your neck
0.35%:  do not want to be right!!
0.35%:  think you just changed science to better allow for our
0.35%:  think you just blew both science
0.63%:  think you just blew both science and our
0.35%:  forgot that you could just
0.35%:  just thought of ten really
0.35%:  used to be
0.35%:  could write that science book
0.35%:  would like that to be the case for science but
0.35%:  thought you just wanted to learn
0.35%:  just won the science lottery for a
0.35%:  really just figured out that there
0.35%:  totally just figured out both where
0.35%:  really thought we talked about science too
0.35%:  should totally be a science writer but
0.35%:  would not rule out this theory at
0.35%:  would like to best
0.35%:  should write a science book but before
0.35%:  could write a book about the science!!
0.35%:  just thought of a way science could be real bro
0.35%:  thought you cared about science jokes
0.35%:  just figured out that a
0.35%:  think you just created a new science for our
0.35%:  think you just argued for science
0.35%:  just thought of a better way science could learn
0.35%:  will grant
1.87%:  will grant you that
0.52%:  will grant you that one
0.45%:  will grant you the
0.35%:  feel like you just brought science to bear on that and
0.35%:  reject that theory on grounds of bull
0.35%:  could be wrong about all the science there!!
0.35%:  could be wrong about this but the science of
0.35%:  forgot about the weird
0.40%:  forgot about the weird science
0.35%:  just thought of a new book and it
0.35%:  should totally go back to the
1.46%:  should totally go back to the future
0.35%:  need to go back to that
0.35%:  feel like science just got an
0.67%:  feel like science just got an order
0.35%:  just blew that
0.82%:  just blew that theory to
0.67%:  just blew that theory out of our
0.35%:  need to figure out how to steal all your
0.40%:  need to figure out how to steal all your science
0.35%:  totally just had the science
0.40%:  totally just had the science break
0.35%:  bet you thought science was cool
0.40%:  bet you thought science was cool before
0.58%:  bet you thought science was cool before but
0.35%:  used to think that you were cool but
0.35%:  could be wrong about this one theory but
0.35%:  would like that last
0.35%:  used to think they were all
0.35%:  forgot about the real reason
0.35%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole to your
0.35%:  need to get to science
1.20%:  need to get to science school
0.41%:  need to get to science school!!
0.35%:  really should get to know the
0.43%:  really should get to know the science
0.35%:  thought you looked a
0.35%:  could be wrong about that for the rest
0.35%:  could be wrong for only
0.35%:  forgot about this but
0.35%:  just forgot about that
0.35%:  need to figure out how to hear
0.35%:  think you just blew all our science at
4.41%:  think you just blew all our science at once!!
0.35%:  think science just got way cooler and better
0.35%:  used to think your science
0.35%:  hate to break it to our science
0.35%:  need to call the science guys about that
0.35%:  think you just got a date
0.35%:  should be working on that!!
0.35%:  just got an idea for a theory where
0.35%:  feel like you just brought science to the land
0.35%:  really think we ought
0.35%:  just thought of a way science could be real in
0.35%:  forgot where
0.35%:  refuse to be the only
0.35%:  think our science just got really cool!!
0.35%:  think you just brought science down a floor
0.35%:  thought you were a dark
0.35%:  want to say
0.35%:  think science just got way cooler real
0.35%:  think you just changed science for real bro!!
0.35%:  could be wrong about the entire science of our
0.35%:  thought you were a bro science
0.35%:  just think of that
0.35%:  think we just changed our science for real
0.35%:  feel like you just brought another
0.35%:  told you there were no
0.35%:  feel really good about the work
0.35%:  think you just won the science race for a
0.35%:  just totally figured out black
0.35%:  thought you were out for dinner
0.35%:  forgot to tell you!!
0.35%:  feel like that could be just
0.55%:  feel like that could be just about
0.35%:  think you just got all of science!!
0.35%:  forgot the answer could be science!!
0.35%:  think we should tell science to get
0.35%:  hate to burst your balloon with
3.06%:  hate to burst your balloon with science
1.45%:  hate to burst your balloon with science but
0.35%:  just created an
0.35%:  just got fr
0.35%:  just figured out where all the corn
0.35%:  think you just won the science battle of our era
0.38%:  think you just won the science battle of our era!!
0.35%:  thought of a better way
0.35%:  totally just figured out how to back
0.35%:  think you just argued better for
0.35%:  just got a science boner while
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science for the rest
0.35%:  just created a new science for
0.35%:  wrote a science article about
0.35%:  just thought of a killer science lecture!!
0.35%:  think you just got all the science ner
0.35%:  need to figure out how to sc
0.35%:  just figured that out all on

0.44%:  think you just ate all the science
0.35%:  just wrote an entire science book that
0.35%:  just got called a science bro by the
0.35%:  just figured out where black hole
0.35%:  feel like that could be our
0.35%:  just got owned by science for once
0.35%:  like your new
0.34%:  totally just figured out how to hack
1.67%:  totally just figured out how to hack science
0.34%:  forgot that was your
0.34%:  just called you out for not being there!!
0.34%:  think you just changed our science for better
0.34%:  would totally eat that book!!
0.34%:  hate you for knowing all that
0.92%:  hate you for knowing all that science
0.34%:  just blew all our science out the door!!
0.34%:  need to think about all the science for
0.34%:  think we just found out all there
0.34%:  think you just won the global science battle
0.41%:  think you just won the global science battle for
0.34%:  forgot about that science theory because
0.34%:  think you just got all the real science cred
0.34%:  need to get back into science so
0.34%:  think you just brought down all science to be
0.34%:  could talk about that science
0.34%:  should be angry that
0.34%:  see through your science trick
0.34%:  really need to figure out how to sh
0.34%:  think science just got hard
0.34%:  really need to watch out

0.34%:  think we can safely
0.34%:  could be looking at the future
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science for this
0.38%:  could be wrong about the science for this one!!
0.34%:  would totally not reject
0.34%:  always thought it could be true
0.34%:  just wrote a science book in three
0.34%:  just found out what real
1.77%:  just found out what real science
0.34%:  just broke through science to find
0.34%:  could be wrong about a lot!!
0.34%:  think you just blew science!!
0.34%:  just walked into the cool
0.34%:  was totally right about one of
0.34%:  just figured out how to eat all the cake
0.34%:  thought you were a friend not a science jerk
0.34%:  just noticed what
0.34%:  could write a book just to
0.34%:  could be totally wrong about their fake
0.34%:  think science just got a lot harder
0.34%:  think you just watched science get born before our
0.34%:  just wrote a theory about the
0.34%:  think we just learned about the science
0.37%:  think we just learned about the science of our
0.34%:  just thought of a way to trick all
0.34%:  really need to write that book soon
0.97%:  really need to write that book soon!!
0.34%:  thought you were te
0.34%:  just got all the credit for your science
0.34%:  used to think you were f
0.34%:  forgot they could absorb
0.34%:  really just wrote out
0.34%:  feel like you just got blown
0.34%:  think you just changed science to a
0.34%:  already know enough about science to be this
0.34%:  feel like that theory would just
0.34%:  think you just found how
0.66%:  think you just found how to get
0.34%:  forgot all about how science
0.34%:  would take
6.07%:  would take that theory
2.36%:  would take that theory to
0.51%:  would take that theory to science
0.36%:  would take that as
0.35%:  would take that theory so
0.38%:  would take that theory so far
0.34%:  need to write a science book just for you!!
0.34%:  feel like science just got cool and
0.34%:  should write about that on science
0.88%:  should write about that on science blog
0.42%:  should write about that on science blog!!
0.34%:  really need to look that
0.34%:  forgot about the three
0.34%:  feel like that theory just won science
0.34%:  forgot about the science and now
0.34%:  think you just rewrote all of science to turn
0.34%:  just created the theory of all science
0.34%:  forgot about the science rules
0.34%:  totally just figured out how to hack science!!

0.34%:  should totally write a book one
0.34%:  just got called out by the fr
0.34%:  forgot you could breathe
0.34%:  feel like you just watched a science
0.34%:  just got talked into a theory of science!!
0.34%:  was looking for that theory
0.34%:  could be wrong about science for the literal
0.34%:  thought science was all about not
0.34%:  need to go think about all these
0.34%:  just got called out for a theory
0.34%:  just watched the
0.42%:  just watched the science
0.34%:  think you just got real there for
0.34%:  think science just got harder for a
0.34%:  would like to just forget

0.41%:  would like to just forget that you
0.34%:  just took down
0.36%:  just took down the

0.34%:  would not be able to rule
3.46%:  would not be able to rule that out!!
0.67%:  would not be able to rule out
0.43%:  would not be able to rule that theory
0.42%:  would not be able to rule out the
0.34%:  just got science cred
0.34%:  would like to say to
0.39%:  would like to say to that
0.34%:  should write all
0.34%:  need to go write a book about that
0.77%:  need to go write a book about that!!

0.34%:  think you just allowed for the actual
0.34%:  really just wrote a science book and
0.34%:  should write a science book before that
0.40%:  should write a science book before that guy
0.34%:  do not care for your science tonight

0.34%:  think that just got real for
0.34%:  could be wrong about the rest of their
0.34%:  should really get into science!!
0.34%:  reject that theory too!!
0.34%:  totally just figured out how science can be real
0.34%:  think you need to follow
0.34%:  think you just wrote a real good
1.29%:  think you just wrote a real good science
0.34%:  like that theory better now
0.34%:  really ought to think about science before
0.34%:  thought you were black
0.34%:  would say the
0.34%:  think you just won the science bo
0.34%:  clearly need to write a book of short
0.95%:  clearly need to write a book of short science
0.34%:  just figured out what the really
0.63%:  just figured out what the really cool
0.54%:  just figured out what the really cool science
0.34%:  should write that book before science

0.34%:  just wrote a science book about the
0.34%:  think the only
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science but for real
0.34%:  forgot to call the
0.34%:  would like that theory to be real so
0.34%:  think we could all agree that you
2.35%:  think we could all agree that you just
0.34%:  forgot that was the current
0.34%:  think science just created a new theory

0.34%:  just got called out by fr
0.34%:  forgot they were real
0.34%:  just got all the way here for
0.34%:  just threw out a theory of science
0.34%:  think for the rest

0.34%:  think you just rewrote the global
1.53%:  think you just rewrote the global science
0.34%:  totally bought that!!
0.34%:  hate to break the news to you but if
0.34%:  just got the idea for a block
0.34%:  think we should be careful not to let our science go
0.34%:  just got a new theory for the science book!!
0.34%:  would like to further clar
0.34%:  really should know about that but
0.34%:  should write a book about all the funny science
0.34%:  just thought about a science idea
0.34%:  think that would count as science!!
0.34%:  could be wrong about the rest of science by
0.34%:  could be the first science bro
0.34%:  really need to consult

0.34%:  think you just got a science hard on
0.34%:  forgot to tell you about when
0.34%:  just need to go back to the library to
0.34%:  forgot about the last theory
0.34%:  just thought of a new race
0.34%:  need to talk to you for a sec
0.34%:  could be wrong about this one but that
0.34%:  could be wrong about all the science but those

0.34%:  feel like you just won science through
0.34%:  think you just rewrote a
0.34%:  think you just rewrote a science
0.34%:  do not know!!

0.34%:  reject this theory due
0.34%:  think you just brought science a
0.34%:  should really get out of science
0.34%:  think you just forgot where
0.34%:  sure would hate

0.41%:  sure would hate to be the guy
0.35%:  sure would hate to be that
0.34%:  wanna
0.34%:  could be wrong about all of science just by
0.34%:  hate it when you talk about science for longer
0.34%:  just killed that
2.42%:  just killed that theory before
0.52%:  just killed that theory!!
0.34%:  reject this theory out of anger
0.34%:  just got owned by a science bro
0.34%:  swear to god if they
0.34%:  just thought you wanted
0.34%:  just thought of new career
0.34%:  do not care about science
0.34%:  just blew all our science right out the back of beyond
0.34%:  need to go back to the library to answer
0.34%:  could write a book about the strange
0.34%:  would eat
0.37%:  would eat that
0.94%:  would eat that theory
1.21%:  would eat that theory for
0.34%:  just thought of a totally rad science book
0.34%:  just figured out that all the cool
1.07%:  just figured out that all the cool science
0.34%:  think you just changed our science for re
0.34%:  knew that theory
0.34%:  really need to figure out how to hurt
0.34%:  just created a theory to
0.34%:  just fell into
1.01%:  just fell into a black
0.34%:  would like for that to not
0.65%:  would like for that to not be the
1.14%:  would like for that to not be the case!!
0.44%:  would like for that to not be science
0.40%:  would like for that to not be true!!
0.34%:  could be on
0.50%:  could be on the
1.24%:  could be on the right
0.41%:  could be on the wrong
0.34%:  need to go think about the science for
0.34%:  just figured out what all the science talk on
0.34%:  thought for sure science would be a
0.34%:  totally forgot about the nuclear
0.34%:  just forgot to include the whole
0.34%:  need to go to the science library to learn about
0.34%:  killed the
0.36%:  killed the theory
0.34%:  would like to reject that theory for science!!

0.34%:  should really write that science book one
0.34%:  already know enough about this!!
0.34%:  could be wrong about this but there are only
0.34%:  just had a science bon
0.34%:  just called you out for talking science bro
0.34%:  need to talk about this theory!!

0.34%:  would say it
0.34%:  think you just watched a
0.61%:  think you just watched a science
0.34%:  refuse to think about where
0.34%:  just wrote an entire book for science called
0.34%:  need to figure out how to c
0.34%:  refuse to allow science to be brought into the

0.34%:  just got a science boner there for like
0.34%:  just wrote a science book before lunch and
0.34%:  feel like you just brought science to that
0.34%:  think you just got all our science for
0.34%:  need to go think about what science
0.38%:  need to go think about what science just
0.34%:  would rather not talk about this for
0.34%:  could be wrong about that but only
0.34%:  need to write a science blog about that
1.01%:  need to write a science blog about that!!
0.34%:  think we just found the science career
0.34%:  think you just altered science fact
0.34%:  used to think about
0.34%:  just burned
0.34%:  should totally write a science book about there
0.34%:  just totally figured out where the black
0.34%:  just got a new theory for science that could be
0.34%:  wrote a book about these
0.69%:  wrote a book about these flying
0.34%:  just got an idea for how to turn the
0.34%:  thought you would be able
0.34%:  just called you out for not being able to be
0.34%:  think you just heard an
0.34%:  think you just allowed science to enter
0.34%:  just created a theory for science to
0.34%:  forgot to include that really
0.34%:  think you just created one of the all
0.34%:  forgot about all the other junk
0.49%:  forgot about all the other junk science

0.34%:  just talked about science with another guy for once
0.34%:  could write a science book for teens that
0.34%:  clearly need to write a science book that just
0.34%:  forgot to rule that out already
0.46%:  forgot to rule that out already!!
0.34%:  forgot to think about all the ways science could be re
0.34%:  really should be a science teacher but
0.34%:  just got a new book deal for
0.34%:  should get to work on that article before
0.34%:  think we just got too
0.34%:  just got hit by a bunch

0.34%:  thought you were all about dis
0.34%:  just threw out science
0.34%:  really think we found out about
0.34%:  would not rule that theory
0.68%:  would not rule that theory out!!
0.34%:  cannot allow this theory to be
0.43%:  cannot allow this theory to be true
1.07%:  cannot allow this theory to be true!!
0.34%:  think you just rewrote the science of all our
0.33%:  think you just well
0.33%:  refuse to think about what science
0.42%:  refuse to think about what science could
0.33%:  think you just won the debate club for all
0.33%:  could really see
0.78%:  could really see that
9.14%:  could really see that working
10.31%:  could really see that working out
11.06%:  could really see that working out for
7.05%:  could really see that working!!

0.59%:  could really see that working for science!!
0.47%:  could really see that being
0.33%:  think you just got ahead
0.46%:  think you just got ahead of science
0.33%:  clearly need to talk about this further
0.33%:  should totally write a freak
0.33%:  would totally take that job
0.33%:  just got thrown
0.41%:  just got thrown into
0.36%:  just got thrown into a black
13.45%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science
3.43%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science!!
0.93%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science by
0.91%:  just got thrown into a black hole!!
0.52%:  just got thrown into a black hole by
0.34%:  just got thrown into a black hole by science
0.33%:  could write a science book just to tell you
0.33%:  just need to figure out how to carbon
0.33%:  totally just figured out science on
0.33%:  think you just blew all our science grant
0.33%:  need to take this
0.58%:  need to take this theory
0.33%:  totally forgot about the science rules!!
0.33%:  totally forgot about cold
0.33%:  totally just figured out the hole
0.33%:  just need to figure out how to cr
0.33%:  should totally write science book for
0.33%:  think you just found science what
0.33%:  forgot all about our
0.33%:  think we just found our career
0.33%:  think we just created another
0.76%:  think we just created another science
0.42%:  think we just created another science for
0.33%:  think you found our secret
0.33%:  thought you were for certain just
0.33%:  need to talk to your science teacher about how fr
0.33%:  think we should totally forget about our science
0.33%:  thought you were just not
0.33%:  thought for sure you knew better!!
0.33%:  just thought of it all at once you
0.33%:  think you just brought all of science on
0.33%:  just talked about science on
0.33%:  would take that theory out
0.33%:  forgot about that but yeah
0.33%:  feel like you just had to
0.33%:  think you just rewrote the rule
0.33%:  would like to start a science club about
0.33%:  totally forgot there were actual
0.40%:  totally forgot there were actual science
0.33%:  think you just wrote a real good science fact
0.48%:  think you just wrote a real good science fact there
0.33%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole back
0.33%:  clearly need to think of
0.33%:  just figured out science once
0.33%:  could be wrong about freak
0.33%:  could be wrong about all these other f
0.33%:  think you just called science wrong
0.33%:  just figured out where all the ant
0.33%:  feel like you just went through science to
0.33%:  would rather be the
0.49%:  would rather be the first
0.34%:  would rather be the last
0.33%:  think you just brought an old
0.38%:  think you just brought an old science
0.33%:  think you just won science bro battle!!
0.33%:  think we found our theory to
0.33%:  think science just got way harder for
0.33%:  could totally win a science grant
0.33%:  could be talking about science to
0.33%:  could write a book that theory
0.33%:  think you just freed the
0.33%:  totally forgot we could use that
0.33%:  really need to look into the
1.97%:  really need to look into the science
0.33%:  should get a job at the science centre or
0.33%:  do not want to hear your science right
0.33%:  just thought of it and you all
0.33%:  need to get on this theory
0.33%:  could be wrong about all of the science but they are
0.33%:  think you just got real science real
0.33%:  would like that to be the only reason
0.33%:  forgot you were on
1.58%:  forgot you were on the dark
0.66%:  forgot you were on the science
0.39%:  forgot you were on this
0.33%:  think you just found science all
0.33%:  just got a bunch of science theory
0.33%:  just figured out that not
0.55%:  just figured out that not only are black
0.33%:  forgot to close
0.33%:  totally should be working on science
0.33%:  should write a science lecture book for the
0.33%:  could be talking to a future science star here
0.33%:  need to figure out how to be science
0.33%:  would like to be one
0.49%:  would like to be one of the
0.33%:  think you just got science the
0.33%:  think you should be science fact
0.33%:  really just thought of an
0.33%:  think we just created a science theory to
0.33%:  could be talking about real science for re
0.33%:  think you just learned about science the
0.33%:  think you just brought all of science to bear on a
0.33%:  forgot about the black holes in outer
0.33%:  think you just found a better science to
0.33%:  should write a book about the science content
0.33%:  think these
0.33%:  just got called a science bro by another
0.45%:  just got called a science bro by another bro
0.43%:  just got called a science bro by another bro!!
0.33%:  just thought of a totally real
0.33%:  just figured out the new science
0.37%:  just figured out the new science theory
0.33%:  think science just got a lot harder!!
0.33%:  would not be able to rule out this
0.34%:  would not be able to rule out this theory
0.40%:  would not be able to rule out this theory!!
0.33%:  totally just figured out how to enhance
0.33%:  think you just rewrote all of science better
0.33%:  need to go back to the library but
0.33%:  just got called out by the science!!
0.33%:  really need to figure out how to subt
0.33%:  just thought of a way science could be eternal
0.33%:  think you just got to the core of all science and we
0.33%:  refuse to look into whether
0.33%:  feel like that theory was
0.33%:  should totally write a science book but for
0.33%:  just thought of it now but clearly
0.33%:  thought you said black
0.33%:  just ruined science for both
0.33%:  really should get a science book written for
0.33%:  should really get to work on a
0.41%:  should really get to work on a science
0.33%:  totally just figured out where the al
0.33%:  would kill to be
0.61%:  would kill to be that
0.33%:  wrote a science article!!
0.33%:  would bet that
0.33%:  told you science was boring
0.33%:  just broke down the science of the
0.33%:  hate to be the one to burst your big
0.33%:  need to figure out how to talk about science all
0.33%:  think science just got real cool
0.33%:  need to work on science facts
0.33%:  totally forgot we had a
0.33%:  could be wrong about this but thank
0.33%:  look forward to being eaten by those
0.33%:  hate it when science forces
0.33%:  just had a science theory
0.33%:  would hate to be the one to burst your frag
0.33%:  look forward to telling science about that!!
0.33%:  just told you all
0.38%:  just told you all about
0.33%:  forgot about the sun
0.33%:  need to talk about how
0.33%:  could get into that science
0.33%:  could be talking to the only other
0.33%:  just thought of a way science can be done
0.33%:  just got all the science bro
0.33%:  would listen to that lecture!!
0.33%:  just totally forgot about black
0.33%:  just got hit by a black
1.36%:  just got hit by a black hole of
4.02%:  just got hit by a black hole of science
1.61%:  just got hit by a black hole of science!!
1.32%:  just got hit by a black hole!!
0.55%:  just got hit by a black hole of science and
0.33%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier!!
0.33%:  already know enough about science to just be
0.33%:  could be the first guy to know about real
0.33%:  really wanted to be right for once but science
0.51%:  really wanted to be right for once but science just
0.33%:  think you should be careful to
0.33%:  should totally write a book for science ge
0.33%:  just got a science theory that
0.33%:  just called you science
0.33%:  forgot it
0.52%:  forgot it was science
0.33%:  think you just rewrote both
2.64%:  think you just rewrote both science
0.81%:  think you just rewrote both science and our
0.33%:  forgot to tell you the answer to dark
0.33%:  hate to burst your balloon of science but dark
0.33%:  just got an idea for the new science book!!
0.33%:  totally just blew our
0.46%:  totally just blew our entire
0.88%:  totally just blew our entire science
0.33%:  clearly need to figure out who
0.33%:  would like that to be on
0.33%:  just thought of a better colour
0.33%:  see what
0.33%:  could be totally wrong about the science here just for
0.33%:  should totally be working for the science centre!!
0.33%:  could be wrong about the science but that is really
0.33%:  just totally figured out how the real
0.33%:  really should get that
0.33%:  think we just got a theory about
0.33%:  totally just broke through science to
0.33%:  would like to start a science blog
0.33%:  forgot to rule out black holes in
0.33%:  look forward to telling the truth once
0.33%:  refuse to be outdone!!
0.33%:  should write a book about all the un
0.33%:  hate you for asking
0.34%:  hate you for asking that but
0.33%:  could totally get in
0.40%:  could totally get in on that science
0.33%:  should get a job at the science library
0.33%:  should write a book about science but all
0.33%:  could write a science book but
0.33%:  really need to get on
0.44%:  really need to get on that
0.45%:  really need to get on that science
0.33%:  would take that theory for
1.38%:  would take that theory for science
0.33%:  think you just found the la
0.33%:  went to school for that
0.33%:  think you should be able
0.97%:  think you should be able to get
0.65%:  think you should be able to get a science
0.43%:  think you should be able to get a job
0.33%:  just got all the way to the science
0.33%:  told you there was nothing to fear
0.33%:  really should get better at science!!
0.33%:  could be wrong about the science but at this
0.33%:  should totally write science book about
0.33%:  forgot there were actual
0.33%:  just created a science where
0.33%:  think we just found out the great
0.33%:  only just now thought about it
0.33%:  could be wrong about all of science but the
0.33%:  just figured out a way to re
0.33%:  feel like that would count as science rather
0.33%:  hate to break it to the world science
0.33%:  just wrote a science fact book about
0.33%:  would like to hear about your science
0.33%:  think you just won the global science debate club
0.33%:  sure would like to be the guy that
0.33%:  hate to think of
0.33%:  hate to be the one to bust your fr
0.33%:  do not know about this future
0.33%:  need to talk to you before
0.33%:  just killed science fact
0.33%:  could see that working out for the
0.33%:  think you just changed all science for re
0.33%:  think science just got really hard to
0.33%:  thought you were fun
0.33%:  totally forgot about the whole suck
0.33%:  hate to be the one to bust your black
0.33%:  should write the book on
0.33%:  already forgot about it
0.39%:  already forgot about it!!
0.33%:  think you just allowed science to change our
0.33%:  already know enough about science to settle
0.33%:  just thought of a really neat book
0.33%:  thought science was fake until
0.37%:  thought science was fake until you
0.33%:  think we both just found out science
0.33%:  totally just broke science for real though
0.33%:  could really get into that science book!!
0.33%:  think you just got the science bro award!!
0.33%:  thought you were just bored
0.33%:  could be wrong about the last bit there
0.33%:  just killed a
2.46%:  just killed a theory
2.77%:  just killed a theory about
2.40%:  just killed a theory about the nature
2.31%:  just killed a theory that
1.68%:  just killed a theory of
3.73%:  just killed a theory of science
2.16%:  just killed a theory of science!!
1.11%:  just killed a theory of the
1.05%:  just killed a theory of science that
0.51%:  just killed a theory that science
0.43%:  just killed a theory before
0.36%:  just killed a theory for
1.50%:  just killed a theory for science
1.06%:  just killed a theory for science!!
0.35%:  just killed a theory about what
0.33%:  just created a theory of light
0.33%:  like that theory better now!!
0.33%:  just wrote science fact into
0.33%:  thought you were bad at science before but not
0.33%:  figured out the answer to the science
0.33%:  would totally be for
0.93%:  would totally be for that!!
0.48%:  would totally be for this
0.33%:  think you just changed two of science
0.33%:  would just like to note that your science
0.33%:  was totally right to be
0.33%:  should write that science fan
0.33%:  thought you were bl
0.33%:  just thought about science and it
0.33%:  could really see that working out for the science!!
0.33%:  could be wrong about the science but for the rest
0.33%:  really got
0.33%:  should be talking to you about that
0.53%:  should be talking to you about that!!
0.33%:  think that would be a great science
0.33%:  like the sound of science that
0.33%:  was gonna do
1.13%:  was gonna do that joke
3.46%:  was gonna do that joke but
0.64%:  was gonna do that but
0.51%:  was gonna do that!!
0.33%:  hate to be that guy but wouldn
0.33%:  forgot how to science
0.33%:  totally just won the science debate club for
0.33%:  just created a new theory of science tonight
0.33%:  think the science just got too
1.36%:  think the science just got too real for a
0.57%:  think the science just got too real!!
0.34%:  think the science just got too real for once
0.33%:  should write a fan
0.33%:  feel like you just tr
0.33%:  need to go look at the
0.34%:  need to go look at the science
0.33%:  just got a new theory on the
0.33%:  like that guy
0.33%:  like how your science
0.33%:  hate to break the news to science but your
0.33%:  think we just got to the core of our
0.33%:  would really rather not take
0.33%:  can think of a better way
0.33%:  like how your face
0.33%:  totally just broke down the science of giant
0.33%:  totally forgot about how there are
0.33%:  would argue that no
0.33%:  just figured out both the real
0.33%:  think you just rewrote all of science and are
0.33%:  looked into that for
0.33%:  need to get to work on this theory!!
0.33%:  totally just broke the world!!
0.33%:  could totally be wrong about the science here but if
0.33%:  need to talk to this fellow about
0.33%:  think you just wrote the end
1.91%:  think you just wrote the end of science
0.82%:  think you just wrote the end of science!!
0.33%:  totally think we
1.13%:  totally think we should go
0.60%:  totally think we just
0.65%:  totally think we just found
0.62%:  totally think we just found out
0.48%:  totally think we should go for
0.45%:  totally think we should get
0.41%:  totally think we just found the
0.37%:  totally think we should be
0.33%:  thought you were still around to talk
0.44%:  thought you were still around to talk science
0.33%:  just wrote an entire book of science theory
0.33%:  think you just rewrote the fate
0.33%:  only just figured out the whole
0.33%:  thought science was done!!
0.33%:  could totally go for those
0.33%:  look forward to totally
0.33%:  thought you were just a science bro and
0.33%:  could totally write a book for teens
0.33%:  cannot wait for the day
0.50%:  cannot wait for the day science
0.33%:  can neither
0.33%:  forgot to count that one
0.33%:  really should get to know that
0.33%:  can just about handle

0.33%:  could see that working for a
0.33%:  could be wrong about any of this but the
0.33%:  need to talk to this guy for real

0.33%:  would like for that to be real so
0.33%:  was about to forget
0.33%:  think you just bought a lot
0.38%:  think you just bought a lot of science
0.33%:  will just
0.33%:  totally just figured out how to break science once
0.33%:  think we should be careful not to rule
0.33%:  think you just blew science out of the arena!!
0.33%:  just talked about science for longer than your
0.33%:  just thought of a science book title and
0.33%:  could totally be wrong about science but
0.33%:  think you just got too real!!
0.33%:  can think of at
0.43%:  can think of at least three

0.33%:  would argue that is not
0.33%:  feel really good about that joke now
0.68%:  feel really good about that joke now!!
0.33%:  forgot how to think about science and
0.33%:  totally forgot about what science
0.33%:  just thought of a way to rec
0.33%:  forgot to take the
0.33%:  just blew your entire science out of the back door!!

0.33%:  hate you for telling
0.33%:  think that would be really great
0.33%:  just got all the way out to
0.33%:  would like to see that on science
0.33%:  look forward to you telling us
0.33%:  would not rule that theory out for

0.33%:  just created a science theory that will be
0.33%:  could be wrong about all the science after this
0.33%:  think we just got science for
0.84%:  think we just got science for real
0.33%:  feel like we should try
0.39%:  feel like we should try to
0.33%:  could be wrong about a lot of shit but
0.33%:  think you just got one for the science board!!

0.33%:  think you just blew a science fact
0.33%:  should get out there
0.33%:  would argue that yes
0.33%:  forgot you were here!!
0.33%:  think you just one
0.33%:  could be wrong about little
0.33%:  could totally be wrong but

0.33%:  think you just grabbed the science crown outta
0.33%:  just freaked out that you
0.33%:  bet you thought science would let
0.33%:  think you just changed science two
0.33%:  forgot about black holes and they were
0.33%:  could be the first guy on
0.33%:  forgot about all the non
0.33%:  think you just blew science out of the great
0.33%:  do not like where you just
0.33%:  forgot that the science
0.33%:  just got science on you!!
0.33%:  should tell you what
0.33%:  feel like that theory could go
0.33%:  totally just figured out how to real
0.33%:  like that last
0.33%:  could see that theory working out real
0.33%:  just figured out how to control all science
0.33%:  thought you were just called
0.33%:  think you just forced a science
0.33%:  thought you wanted to be science bros but
0.33%:  need to go work on this

0.33%:  totally forgot about our science
0.33%:  hate that you just broke science for
0.33%:  would buy that science right
0.33%:  think we need to call the
0.56%:  think we need to call the science
0.40%:  think we need to call the science guys
0.77%:  think we need to call the science guys about
0.33%:  forgot to include that the

0.32%:  think you are just about
0.83%:  think you are just about to blow
0.42%:  think you are just about to change
0.67%:  think you are just about to change science
0.39%:  think you are just about the
0.32%:  could be wrong about three
0.32%:  really should write a book for science
0.32%:  do not care for your thought
0.32%:  really should know about science better than
0.32%:  could totally write another science book after
0.32%:  can tell you that
0.32%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but on
0.32%:  was totally right before and
0.32%:  went through all of science just to deb
0.40%:  went through all of science just to debunk a
0.32%:  just broke the entire world of science to
0.32%:  think you just created new science to
0.32%:  can think of at least two
0.32%:  think you just brought real science to bear down

0.32%:  just called you a fake bro to
0.32%:  just figured out how to science better!!
0.32%:  just talked about the science of light
0.32%:  already know enough about science to tell the
0.32%:  look forward to science telling us that one
0.32%:  just totally figured out both
0.32%:  think our science just got way harder
0.32%:  think we just got another
0.32%:  told you those were the
0.32%:  really should take that science
0.32%:  think you just won the debate for all science
0.32%:  thought we could use
0.36%:  thought we could use science
0.41%:  thought we could use science to finally
0.32%:  forget that you are the
0.32%:  should be talking about science not
0.32%:  think we all just heard science get
0.32%:  want to go to the future
0.32%:  totally just thought of a new science rock
0.32%:  think we all just changed science for real
0.32%:  just got hit by another science truck
0.32%:  look forward to telling science they can
0.32%:  want that to be true enough
0.32%:  should write a science blog about that one
0.98%:  should write a science blog about that one!!

0.32%:  refuse to allow science to take the
0.32%:  should write a science book for beg
0.32%:  need to figure out how to take all
0.32%:  forgot you could use science like
4.07%:  forgot you could use science like that!!
0.32%:  really just thought we
0.50%:  really just thought we could

0.32%:  was about to think
0.32%:  totally forgot that science is real!!
0.32%:  like the sound of the latter
0.32%:  could be totally wrong about the science or

0.32%:  need to think really
0.32%:  thought you were just nice to
0.32%:  think you just changed real science for bro
0.32%:  just created the theory of all science!!

0.31%:  forgot to include other
0.31%:  just got a really cool new idea for the
0.31%:  could be talking to future
1.00%:  could be talking to future science
0.31%:  forgot about the science already
0.31%:  thought you were for real!!
0.31%:  just blew all your science out the door!!
0.31%:  feel like the world just got science
0.31%:  look forward to the article on
0.31%:  hate to burst your dark light
0.31%:  thought you were a real science bro but
0.31%:  really ought to write that science
0.40%:  really ought to write that science book
0.31%:  think science just got harder for you
0.31%:  just thought of it and you blew
0.31%:  would like to just go
0.31%:  forgot you were still here and that
0.31%:  thought for certain dark
0.31%:  should totally work at science
0.31%:  would agree
0.31%:  feel a science
0.67%:  feel a science book
1.33%:  feel a science book burning
0.36%:  feel a science lecture
0.31%:  should go to the science lecture
0.31%:  really should get back to not
0.31%:  just need to know if you
0.37%:  just need to know if you thought
0.31%:  think science just got way cooler and better!!
0.31%:  should write a book about the science of regular
0.31%:  clearly need to write a book just about
0.31%:  hate that you just out
0.31%:  would totally go there for science
0.31%:  could write a book on all
1.07%:  could write a book on all the science
0.68%:  could write a book on all the science that
0.31%:  just thought of your entire science
0.31%:  think science just got better for real
0.31%:  can hardly
0.31%:  forgot that science isn
0.31%:  should write that book one
0.31%:  just figured out how the real science
0.31%:  need to write science books for a
0.31%:  think you just won science for three
0.31%:  can already feel
0.31%:  just thought of totally new
0.65%:  just thought of totally new science
0.31%:  want to be best
0.31%:  thought about it once
0.31%:  really should be the one to
0.31%:  totally just thought of science like
0.31%:  feel like that should get you
0.31%:  really ought to be careful
1.09%:  really ought to be careful about
0.43%:  really ought to be careful about who
0.39%:  really ought to be careful about how
0.37%:  really ought to be careful around
0.31%:  just fell down the rabbit hole back to science!!
0.31%:  refuse to talk about science until
0.31%:  think you just won the science debate for actual
0.31%:  forgot about black holes and science
0.31%:  gotta sit
1.67%:  gotta sit down for
0.88%:  gotta sit down!!

0.31%:  could really use a break
1.92%:  could really use a break right
3.23%:  could really use a break right now!!
0.31%:  should write a letter to the science blog
0.31%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole to our
0.31%:  need to go to the beach
0.31%:  think you just cleaned
0.31%:  totally just got science on
0.31%:  think we all just found true
0.31%:  think you just allowed science to reach
0.31%:  just figured out how all the non
0.31%:  think you should get a job on

0.31%:  cannot wait for science books
0.31%:  think you just rewrote science to agree
0.31%:  could really go for an
0.31%:  really thought about it but
0.31%:  just thought of a way to not be called
0.31%:  would like to note that for science
0.31%:  totally just figured out the known
0.31%:  really think we just found the real
0.31%:  really need to take a science
0.31%:  should write a book about ut
0.31%:  should write the science book
0.31%:  would rather not talk about such
0.31%:  think you just brought down all science for real
0.31%:  forgot you were there and
0.31%:  think you just unr

0.31%:  should really get back into science for
0.31%:  told you there were no such

0.31%:  could be looking at the answer
0.31%:  think you just forgot to call
0.31%:  forgot to do
0.31%:  just ignored all
0.37%:  just ignored all your
0.31%:  should totally write a book about free
0.31%:  should get to work on that science career

0.31%:  can totally get on board for this!!
0.31%:  refuse to think about how utterly
0.31%:  feel like the world has
0.31%:  could be wrong for the only

0.31%:  thought you looked cute in
0.31%:  should totally be a science teacher but for
0.31%:  just got science boner

0.31%:  totally forgot the answer could be science!!
0.31%:  could be wrong about the science for like
0.31%:  really thought for a second!!
0.31%:  think you just won the science debate for all our
0.31%:  think we just brought science fact to
0.31%:  should not be
0.31%:  could be wrong about all of science theory
0.31%:  should write a book before that
0.31%:  need to figure out how to let science
0.31%:  could write a book about your
0.31%:  thought for sure science would tell
0.31%:  could be wrong about all that other science
0.31%:  think you just created a new science for both
0.31%:  could be wrong about 
0.31%:  could totally write a science book for the rest
0.31%:  just really want to be
0.31%:  just totally thought of a science book
0.31%:  feel like the world just got a tr
0.31%:  just figured out how the science totally
0.31%:  just figured out where the cool
0.31%:  should write a science book for 
0.31%:  think we should totally go to science
0.31%:  just wanted to talk about science for once!!
0.31%:  just thought about it before
0.31%:  think we all better go
0.31%:  think you just had better
0.72%:  think you just had better science
0.31%:  just thought of a way to order
0.31%:  just thought of a way science could be real broken!!
0.31%:  need to talk to you about all
0.42%:  need to talk to you about all the science
0.31%:  just had like the cool
0.31%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science but
0.31%:  could be looking at a
0.31%:  think you just brought science fact too
0.31%:  need to talk to all the science bros!!
0.31%:  thought science was all about deb
0.31%:  feel like the science just got way too
0.43%:  feel like the science just got way too hard
0.31%:  feel like you just brought science to bear down
0.31%:  just got turned on to science while
0.31%:  better get
0.31%:  totally just figured out how science can be both
0.53%:  totally just figured out how science can be both real
0.31%:  think you just cured all of science to
0.31%:  forgot about this theory called
0.31%:  just got a science theory that could
0.31%:  was about to be really
0.31%:  need to call the science bro
0.91%:  need to call the science bros right
0.87%:  need to call the science bros right away
0.56%:  need to call the science bros about
0.31%:  could be wrong about all the science theory
0.31%:  thought of a better joke but
0.31%:  thought of a better joke but now
0.31%:  would rate this theory 
0.31%:  can totally get behind that for
0.60%:  can totally get behind that for science
0.58%:  can totally get behind that for sure
0.70%:  can totally get behind that for sure!!
0.48%:  can totally get behind that for science!!
0.31%:  just thought of it too and you
0.31%:  feel like you just thought science
0.31%:  think you just turned what
0.31%:  just got an idea for your
0.31%:  forgot to include all those other
0.31%:  forgot that science is really
0.31%:  just figured out how to talk science on
0.31%:  thought you were still back at
0.31%:  clearly need to think about what
0.31%:  think you just learned how to science better!!
0.31%:  think you should forget
0.47%:  think you should forget about
0.51%:  think you should forget about science
0.31%:  could write a book about that for science ner
0.31%:  could be wrong about the rest of you all
0.31%:  totally should be a science teacher for
0.31%:  think our theory just got science fact
0.37%:  think our theory just got science factual
0.31%:  forgot about dark bro
0.31%:  look forward to the science in that
0.31%:  thought of a counter to your
0.31%:  just forgot to breathe and
0.31%:  think you just got all of science done at
0.31%:  hate how you just took
0.31%:  cannot argue
1.01%:  cannot argue with that!!

0.33%:  cannot argue with your
0.47%:  cannot argue with your science
0.31%:  need science to figure out that answer
0.31%:  was talking out loud before but that
0.31%:  feel like our
0.51%:  feel like our science
0.50%:  feel like our science just
0.47%:  feel like our science just got way
0.53%:  feel like our science just got way cool
1.16%:  feel like our science just got way cooler!!
0.31%:  feel like our science just got real
0.31%:  just got a bunch of science bon
0.31%:  would like that last theory
0.31%:  just got the idea for a science book where all
0.31%:  forgot that they
0.31%:  should write a science fact book on
0.31%:  would like to be an
0.31%:  need to figure out how to alert
0.40%:  need to figure out how to alert science
0.31%:  just thought of a new cool
0.44%:  just thought of a new cool science
0.31%:  like to call that the
0.31%:  just got an idea for a science bullet
0.31%:  just want to be clear on
0.31%:  thought you liked science just
0.31%:  should totally get a job in science after
0.31%:  forgot about all the current
0.92%:  forgot about all the current science
0.31%:  just totally forgot how science
0.31%:  write
0.55%:  write science
0.31%:  want to go to the library!!
0.31%:  think we just found out science really
0.31%:  hate to break it to future
0.72%:  hate to break it to future science
0.30%:  just thought of a way science couldn
0.30%:  hate to be rude but holy
0.30%:  think you just rewrote all of science at the
0.30%:  just forgot that
0.37%:  just forgot that dark
0.30%:  laughed because
0.30%:  really should write a book before
0.30%:  just think of all the science you
2.77%:  just think of all the science you could be
0.51%:  just think of all the science you could get
0.30%:  feel like they could just
0.30%:  think the answer to all
0.58%:  think the answer to all our
0.46%:  think the answer to all of
1.59%:  think the answer to all of science
0.85%:  think the answer to all of science could
0.50%:  think the answer to all of our science
0.42%:  think the answer to all of your
0.38%:  think the answer to all your
0.33%:  think the answer to all our science
0.30%:  thought it would be really
0.30%:  think you just heard about
0.30%:  think you just watched science get born!!
0.30%:  just figured out how science can be totally broken
0.30%:  should be talking to the
0.30%:  should write that book for science!!
0.30%:  think we should all get out of our science
0.30%:  thought you were science but
0.30%:  totally forgot that could be an
0.30%:  think we all just agreed to science!!
0.30%:  totally just got an idea for how science
0.30%:  forgot about that because science!!
0.30%:  forgot about black holes but now they
0.30%:  could be the one
1.19%:  could be the one to finally
0.47%:  could be the one who
0.37%:  could be the one who figures
0.34%:  could be the one who finally
0.30%:  think the science just got way too real for once!!
0.30%:  just got a new theory that could be science
0.30%:  used to think we
0.30%:  totally just figured out how there can be no
0.30%:  think our science just got turned
0.30%:  would like to argue that the only
0.30%:  just figured out how to clear all the
0.32%:  just figured out how to clear all the science
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about the science of it
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about the fate
0.30%:  think we just got a theory of science!!
0.30%:  thought you were into dark
0.30%:  would argue that they are not
0.30%:  should totally write a book for science teacher
0.30%:  think you just won that debate for science
0.37%:  think you just won that debate for science!!
0.30%:  already thought of it
0.30%:  just got science yelled at!!

0.30%:  really should get back on that
0.30%:  thought you liked science as
0.30%:  like how the
0.30%:  should write a book on the science of all
0.30%:  just thought of a way science can tell
0.30%:  just blew all our science right outta here
0.30%:  swear to god if there really
0.30%:  should totally get back into science when
0.30%:  could totally be working on that
0.30%:  hate to be the one to burst your big dark
0.30%:  think we all just got the science
0.30%:  forgot about how science totally
0.30%:  hate you for knowing better
0.67%:  hate you for knowing better science
0.30%:  just got another idea for a theory
0.30%:  forgot all about dark theory
0.30%:  want to hug you and
0.30%:  would totally hang out in
0.30%:  think science just got a whole better
0.30%:  should totally write a science fact book to
0.30%:  just broke through all
0.30%:  would like to be a science guy
0.30%:  think you just bought a one
0.30%:  could be wrong about this science theory!!
0.30%:  think you just got real for science!!
0.30%:  forgot about all the science you just threw
0.30%:  think you just ate all the food
0.30%:  just figured out how to break all science!!
0.30%:  could write a science book on that one
0.30%:  could be right about a
0.53%:  could be right about a lot of science
0.30%:  think science just got really cool for three
0.30%:  could be right about so
0.30%:  just thought about science and it blew
0.30%:  just got called out for science on
0.30%:  just killed a theory about how
0.30%:  would not argue
0.30%:  just figured out what can
0.30%:  thought you were an actual science bro for
0.30%:  thought you cared about science all
0.30%:  would be the first to call that
0.30%:  just broke the law of nature
0.30%:  totally forgot that could be where
0.30%:  think you just got harder for
4.15%:  think you just got harder for science
1.63%:  think you just got harder for science!!
0.30%:  would look into that but there
0.30%:  could be wrong about all these but
0.30%:  need to work on the
0.69%:  need to work on the science
0.30%:  just figured out how all the real

0.33%:  just got thrown into the dark
0.32%:  just got thrown into the black
0.30%:  really need to figure out how to just talk
0.30%:  think science just got real hard
0.30%:  just figured out where all the cat
0.30%:  think you found out the
1.36%:  think you found out the secret
0.30%:  could be wrong about another theory!!
0.30%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to outer
0.30%:  just want you
0.30%:  just wrote a science blog

0.30%:  thought you were all science before!!
0.30%:  feel like science just let
0.30%:  could be wrong about real
0.48%:  could be wrong about real science
0.34%:  could be wrong about real science for
0.32%:  could be wrong about real life
0.30%:  could be talking about science here but then
0.30%:  thought you were a bro too
0.39%:  thought you were a bro too!!
0.30%:  think you just blew all the science around
0.30%:  was totally joking before but that one
0.30%:  clearly forgot to think
0.63%:  clearly forgot to think about the
0.53%:  clearly forgot to think about the science
0.30%:  do not recall agree
0.30%:  just got a whole bunch better
9.47%:  just got a whole bunch better at science
8.15%:  just got a whole bunch better at science!!
0.32%:  just got a whole bunch better at science for
0.30%:  think you just won the science b
0.30%:  need science to look
0.31%:  need science to look further
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about this but for
0.30%:  need science to figure out the
0.98%:  need science to figure out the truth
0.60%:  need science to figure out the truth!!
0.30%:  thought you were all about science and object
0.30%:  could totally be wrong about the entire fr
0.30%:  just heard you talking about science for once!!
0.30%:  hate to burst your science balloon there but
0.30%:  just got a really cool science idea for
0.48%:  just got a really cool science idea for the
0.30%:  would like to try
0.52%:  would like to try that
0.30%:  feel like you just got a science
0.30%:  would like to see the science on that but
0.30%:  feel like science just got real and
0.30%:  just thought of a brand new article to
0.30%:  just figured out the science to a theory
0.30%:  totally just ruined the science
0.30%:  just found out that light
0.30%:  can totally see it
0.87%:  can totally see it now!!
0.39%:  can totally see it!!
0.30%:  could win
0.50%:  could win the
0.48%:  could win the science
0.30%:  just wrote a science theory that
0.76%:  just wrote a science theory that could
0.41%:  just wrote a science theory that could be real
0.54%:  just wrote a science theory that could be real!!
0.30%:  just got science harder on you than
0.30%:  just need to think
0.79%:  just need to think about how
0.30%:  think you just found the science lo
0.30%:  think you just won the science degree!!
0.30%:  can see through you!!
0.30%:  think that just blew our
0.30%:  think you just found a science hole
0.30%:  should totally work on that!!
0.30%:  laughed at
0.35%:  laughed at your
0.57%:  laughed at your joke
0.78%:  laughed at your joke but

0.65%:  laughed at your joke but now
0.43%:  laughed at your joke but secret
0.33%:  laughed at your joke but then it
0.30%:  need to write a book real
0.30%:  think the science just got too real for once!!
0.30%:  think you just forward
0.30%:  just figured out the real role
0.30%:  should totally get back into science now!!
0.30%:  look forward to seeing the science you
0.30%:  should totally write science fact book about
0.30%:  totally just wrote a science book and then
0.30%:  think we just got science hard
0.30%:  think you just rewrote all of the science to
0.30%:  look forward to being eaten by a
0.30%:  forgot to include all other
0.30%:  need to get back to earth!!
0.30%:  thought you were all science but
0.30%:  just created a new theory of science right on
0.30%:  would like that to count
0.30%:  do not know about science but clearly this
0.30%:  think we found a real science
0.30%:  should write a book on the science of bull
0.30%:  look forward to being able to say the
0.30%:  just figured out how to be really cool at science!!
0.30%:  find that
0.30%:  should get back to the library now before
0.30%:  think you just got a hold of science
0.30%:  would like to be alone
0.30%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole to an
0.30%:  think you just got all the science fact
0.30%:  should really know better than to forget
0.30%:  look forward to all the science con
0.30%:  should totally write a book on science but
0.30%:  think you just created enough science for two
0.30%:  just got turned on by a science bro!!
0.30%:  would like that theory to be fact
0.30%:  look forward to the science lecture they
0.30%:  just now figured out that all
0.30%:  think you just touched science for
0.30%:  think you just rewrote science for that one
0.30%:  need to figure out how to sh
0.30%:  think you just got three
0.30%:  should write a science fact book or
0.30%:  should totally go to science con
0.30%:  should really get on that before
0.30%:  just figured out the way the
0.30%:  forgot about the nature
0.30%:  think you just burned a
0.30%:  could be wrong about the science in that but
0.30%:  always though
0.30%:  think you just went too far to
0.30%:  think you just got all of the science out
0.30%:  really just wanted to go on
0.30%:  could really get into that book!!
0.30%:  could totally be wrong about these freak
0.30%:  totally just thought of a real science book
0.30%:  could totally write that book for science!!
0.30%:  need to get back on this
0.30%:  could write a book about the science of just
0.30%:  just now figured out that the science
0.30%:  just got science yelled at for
0.30%:  should totally write a science for
0.30%:  really just need to figure out how to thank
0.30%:  think you should get a science job for
0.30%:  need to go to the science club
0.30%:  think you just got all of the science on
0.30%:  want you
0.30%:  totally just forgot about science!!
0.30%:  just figured out how to clear all science
0.30%:  need to take this theory to science
0.30%:  should write a science teacher
1.13%:  should write a science teacher book
0.78%:  should write a science teacher book!!
0.30%:  should write a science teacher book about
0.30%:  just thought of it all at once and
0.30%:  need to follow through
0.30%:  could talk about science for years!!
0.30%:  think our science just got all
0.44%:  think our science just got all the
0.31%:  think our science just got all the way to
0.30%:  feel like you just brought science to bear on an old
0.30%:  think you just brought all of science to a brand
0.30%:  think you just robbed science of that
0.30%:  think you just won a free bur
0.67%:  think you just won a free burger!!

0.30%:  think you just got called out for science!!
0.30%:  wrote a science book and it
0.30%:  just thought of a way to be all
0.40%:  just thought of a way to be all science
0.30%:  forgot about all the other science you
0.30%:  forgot about the one where dark
0.30%:  just got a science boner for the entire
0.30%:  just broke the entire world of science but
0.30%:  hate to break the news but science
0.30%:  could be talking about science after
0.30%:  would like for that to be a theory
0.30%:  should write a science blog for
0.30%:  do not know about that!!
0.30%:  just figured out how to science that
0.30%:  hate to be wrong but this
0.30%:  could totally be a genius
0.35%:  could totally be a genius!!
0.30%:  just got the theory
0.30%:  should get a job at the science centre for
0.30%:  just got idea for new theory!!
0.30%:  would like to hear you further
0.30%:  just got turned on by science after
0.30%:  just figured out how to be really ob
0.30%:  lost
0.35%:  lost track

1.35%:  lost track of where
1.02%:  lost track of the
0.94%:  lost track of where that
0.89%:  lost track of what you
0.54%:  lost track of where you
0.49%:  lost track of how
0.47%:  lost track of where the
0.38%:  lost track of whether
0.31%:  lost track of that
0.34%:  lost track of that theory
0.30%:  could totally be wrong about this for science
0.30%:  just freaked out the
0.30%:  should buy a ticket for the lot
0.30%:  really just thought about science for two
0.30%:  cannot tell you how right
0.30%:  think you just won the science club battle
0.37%:  think you just won the science club battle ro
0.30%:  used to think you were the science bro
0.30%:  need to talk to you further about science!!
0.30%:  was trying to talk
0.32%:  was trying to talk science
0.30%:  could be a science guy
0.30%:  think we all just learned a
0.30%:  just thought of a new science career you
0.30%:  look forward to selling
0.38%:  look forward to selling the
0.30%:  just called you out for talking science!!
0.30%:  need to talk to you through
0.30%:  would like to eat that theory!!
0.30%:  feel like science just got a bunch harder!!
0.30%:  forgot to notice
0.30%:  think you just forced the science to
0.30%:  bet you that
0.30%:  should write a book for other
0.30%:  forgot about dark theory!!
0.30%:  could totally be a giant
0.30%:  just thought of a way to science out
0.30%:  just blew all our science right outta the fr
0.30%:  could be wrong about the science but the last
0.30%:  just figured out how there can be science
0.30%:  just went through a full
0.30%:  just broke through into science
0.30%:  just got killed
2.26%:  just got killed by science
0.99%:  just got killed by science!!
0.30%:  could be talking to the future now
0.30%:  feel like you just brought the cool
0.30%:  thought for sure you were one
0.30%:  just want to be clear before you
0.30%:  forgot all about the dark theory!!
0.30%:  should go back to the future
0.30%:  just got the idea to
0.30%:  look forward to the science grant that
0.30%:  should totally write that book one
0.30%:  need to figure out how to buy a
0.30%:  would totally go for these
0.30%:  just got blown back into the future a
0.30%:  would totally take a
0.51%:  would totally take a course
0.30%:  think you just blew a bunch of science at
0.30%:  feel like science just won another
0.30%:  just got turned on by science real
0.30%:  really just figured out how to create
0.30%:  feel like science just got done
0.30%:  would buy that ticket
0.30%:  kind of want to hug
0.30%:  gotta science
0.30%:  hate to be the one to burst your buck
0.30%:  would like to count
0.56%:  would like to count that
0.30%:  could write a book on all these
0.30%:  clearly need to look further into that
0.30%:  totally just heard science talk
0.30%:  would like to see that on a science blog!!
0.30%:  should really work on better
0.30%:  should write a grant
0.36%:  should write a grant for
0.64%:  should write a grant for that!!
0.30%:  forgot that science could be totally
0.30%:  thought science was cool!!
0.30%:  refuse to think about how badly
0.30%:  look forward to the science lecture tonight!!
0.30%:  just think about science for
0.30%:  think you just turned all the science of
0.30%:  already thought of it!!
0.30%:  choose to forget
0.30%:  forgot about that joke
0.30%:  need to figure out how to tell black
0.30%:  think you forgot to breathe just

0.30%:  really need to think about what colour
0.30%:  think you just told a better
0.30%:  need to get on the
0.33%:  need to get on the science
0.30%:  totally just ruined science for the both
0.30%:  would be so into
1.69%:  would be so into that!!
0.93%:  would be so into that theory
1.53%:  would be so into that theory!!
0.30%:  need to get to work!!
0.30%:  really forgot about the science
0.30%:  just blew all your science right out the back and
0.30%:  refuse to let science ruin
0.30%:  would take that theory far
0.30%:  could see that working for about
0.43%:  could see that working for about three
0.30%:  just forgot about all
1.66%:  just forgot about all the science
1.04%:  just forgot about all the other

0.30%:  thought you were science for
2.36%:  thought you were science for a second!!
0.85%:  thought you were science for a second but
0.30%:  totally forgot about this dark
0.30%:  think you just changed science to be a lot
0.30%:  think we could all be
0.30%:  thought you were a science bro for like
0.30%:  think you just lowered the bar for science one

0.30%:  just noticed a
0.30%:  think you just blew science out of the garden
0.30%:  got it
0.30%:  think you just got all of science bro
0.30%:  think you just brought science forward 
0.30%:  was trying to talk science but
0.30%:  think science just won the debate of
0.42%:  think science just won the debate of our
0.30%:  do not care what science
0.30%:  should really go to the science fair
0.30%:  think you need to tell science
0.83%:  think you need to tell science about
0.30%:  always thought it could be one
0.30%:  should be a science teacher for
0.30%:  used to think they were cool but
0.30%:  look forward to nothing else
0.30%:  think you need to get out of science
0.30%:  thought you were real science but
0.30%:  should buy a ticket for that lot
0.30%:  can see through your dark
0.30%:  could get a
0.30%:  really think we should go out to
0.30%:  look forward to all your science
0.30%:  should get to work on a science article about
0.30%:  just got a new theory for all the science!!
0.30%:  thought you were bad at science for
0.30%:  think we just found out there really
0.30%:  would call this science
0.30%:  look forward to you telling us that
0.30%:  should really know about science
0.90%:  should really know about science before
0.47%:  should really know about science better
0.30%:  just found out the thing
0.30%:  forgot you know science
0.30%:  need to call the science book
0.52%:  need to call the science book authors
0.52%:  need to call the science book author
0.33%:  need to call the science book writers
0.30%:  could be wrong about science but not
0.30%:  just figured out a way to science the he
0.30%:  hate to break it to you all but we
0.30%:  need to talk to the guys who run science!!
0.30%:  would kill for that to be true but science
0.30%:  feel like you just changed who
0.30%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science related
0.30%:  think you just found the al
0.30%:  should write a book of science but call
0.30%:  could be wrong about all these tiny
0.30%:  just got all science on your behind!!
0.30%:  think you just won science bull
0.30%:  should totally write a science book at
0.30%:  should write a science book for the totally un
0.30%:  look forward to science trying that out
0.30%:  could totally win the freak
0.30%:  think you just created real science to
0.30%:  could totally see the science working that
0.30%:  need to buy tickets
0.93%:  need to buy tickets for
0.94%:  need to buy tickets for the science
0.47%:  need to buy tickets for that

0.51%:  used to think you were cooler than science but
0.30%:  cannot tell whether you just broke
0.80%:  cannot tell whether you just broke science
0.63%:  cannot tell whether you just broke science or if
0.30%:  should write a book before that guy
0.30%:  should write a book about science later
0.48%:  should write a book about science later!!
0.30%:  could be right about another
0.30%:  think you found our science teacher
0.30%:  feel like you just un
0.30%:  just got all science on you without
0.30%:  really need to think about the fact
0.30%:  feel like science just got a whole ton
0.30%:  forgot the whole science
0.30%:  forgot about black holes and neut
0.30%:  clearly need to work faster
0.30%:  could be wrong about all of science but at
0.30%:  think you just touched on a real
0.61%:  think you just touched on a real science
0.30%:  should get back to you on that before science
0.30%:  think we should go for
0.30%:  just thought of a science too
0.30%:  think we found our latest science theory to be
0.30%:  should write a book about science only
0.30%:  really do think about science too
0.30%:  thought you liked science not
0.30%:  think you just found a science lo
0.30%:  bet you could write that on
0.30%:  could really get into those
0.30%:  could see that theory working for a
0.30%:  think you just brought science to bear down
0.30%:  totally just figured out a new science!!
0.30%:  learned
0.66%:  learned about
0.32%:  learned about that
0.30%:  could be wrong about all the other fant
0.30%:  would like to hug your face!!
0.30%:  should write a science book that counter
0.30%:  look forward to that night
0.30%:  refuse to let dark
0.30%:  really should get back to science!!
0.30%:  forgot what the actual
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about fr
0.30%:  think you just created a new science of the
0.30%:  forgot to tell you there would
0.34%:  forgot to tell you there would be a science
0.30%:  need to start talking science
0.30%:  thought you were about to break
0.30%:  think you just found what all science
0.30%:  would like that to be a real science
0.65%:  would like that to be a real science theory
0.30%:  need to figure out how to carbon
0.30%:  think you just blew all the science and
0.30%:  really think we just found out there
0.30%:  reject all
0.88%:  reject all future
0.78%:  reject all future science
0.92%:  reject all future science until

1.34%:  reject all future science based on your
0.55%:  reject all future science based on that
0.30%:  reject all your
0.33%:  reject all your science
0.30%:  look forward to hunting
0.35%:  look forward to hunting these
0.30%:  would like to return to the surface
0.30%:  gotta write that science book!!
0.30%:  should be working on that science
0.30%:  just blew all our science right out the back of beyond!!
0.30%:  hate to break the news to you bud
0.30%:  was born to figure out that theory
0.30%:  just thought of a way to back
0.30%:  really should know better about science

0.30%:  think you just argued science for
0.37%:  think you just argued science for the
0.30%:  feel like you just robbed a
0.30%:  can totally get behind fake bro science
0.30%:  can totally get behind fake bro science!!

0.30%:  really think we should get a
0.30%:  just got all the science out
0.30%:  would hate to be right
0.30%:  just got science friend
0.30%:  just threw out a bunch
8.47%:  just threw out a bunch of science
1.60%:  just threw out a bunch of science and
1.37%:  just threw out a bunch of science to
0.79%:  just threw out a bunch of science at

0.38%:  just threw out a bunch of really
0.58%:  just threw out a bunch of really good
2.03%:  just threw out a bunch of really good science
0.32%:  just threw out a bunch of science to try
0.30%:  can totally feel
0.30%:  forgot to think about all those
0.30%:  really need to start looking for the
0.30%:  need to get back into the
1.58%:  need to get back into the science
0.30%:  just thought of a totally un
0.30%:  could totally be a science genius but
0.30%:  really need to figure out how to carbon
0.30%:  think you just won the science table
0.30%:  just got the idea for a new rock
0.30%:  just got all science on you with that

0.30%:  just got the chill
0.30%:  forgot you were around!!

0.30%:  forgot about the science rules!!
0.30%:  think you just won the global science race for
0.30%:  could be right about all that
0.30%:  should be talking to you about science!!
0.30%:  need to tell you about what
0.30%:  really wrote that book just for
0.30%:  totally figured out how science
0.30%:  just thought of ten science
0.30%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole on your butt
0.30%:  think you just grabbed the ball
0.30%:  think the science world just got cool
0.30%:  would think about that for about
0.30%:  would argue that they still count
0.30%:  can barely breathe for
0.30%:  really just want to hear
0.30%:  feel like science just got that
0.30%:  should write a book about all the science for
0.30%:  think we just got too real
1.22%:  think we just got too real for science
0.61%:  think we just got too real for science!!
0.30%:  would like for that to be the case but only
0.30%:  need to write that book real
0.30%:  do not know if you
0.41%:  do not know if you just
0.30%:  need to get to a

0.45%:  need to get to a black
0.94%:  need to get to a black hole
0.30%:  need to talk to you for a sec!!
0.30%:  could talk about science for an hour
0.30%:  really need to figure out how to str
0.30%:  just figured out what the real science break
0.30%:  really hate to be wrong about science
0.30%:  thought you were real dark about
0.34%:  thought you were real dark about science
0.30%:  just got an idea for a science web
0.30%:  would like to sl
0.30%:  could be talking to the future best
0.68%:  could be talking to the future best science
0.30%:  think you just brought a science fact down
0.30%:  think we got science
0.30%:  totally forgot about other
0.30%:  think you just won the science debate of a
0.30%:  really thought it would be one
0.30%:  forgot to watch
0.30%:  really need to think about what to
0.30%:  should write a book to tell future
0.30%:  need science to work
4.67%:  need science to work on that right
2.44%:  need science to work on that theory
0.99%:  need science to work on this
1.72%:  need science to work on this theory
0.57%:  need science to work on that because
0.53%:  need science to work on that for
0.49%:  need science to work on that!!
0.47%:  need science to work on that theory!!
0.30%:  need science to work on this theory!!
0.30%:  just got a really cool new idea for the science
0.30%:  thought you were for science and reason!!
0.30%:  totally got
0.30%:  think we should be careful not to be
0.30%:  look forward to your guest
0.29%:  think the science just blew your
0.29%:  think you just argued better for the
0.29%:  just figured out the way to science
0.29%:  just freaked out there
0.29%:  just thought of a science you
0.29%:  thought for sure science would notice
0.29%:  totally just thought of a world
0.29%:  just broke the entire world of science that
0.29%:  forget how to think
0.49%:  forget how to think about
1.21%:  forget how to think about science
0.51%:  forget how to think about science because
0.29%:  think you just changed science real
0.29%:  like that theory about
0.29%:  really wanted to get out of science
0.29%:  hate to break the news to you but all of
3.41%:  hate to break the news to you but all of science
0.34%:  hate to break the news to you but all of science could
0.29%:  thought you cared about science real
0.29%:  just got burned by science fact
0.29%:  should write a science f
0.29%:  look forward to either
0.29%:  need to get back in the
0.69%:  need to get back in the science
0.29%:  really need to talk to our
1.04%:  really need to talk to our science
0.29%:  just threw out a bunch of science to get
0.29%:  think science just went
0.29%:  think you just f
0.29%:  just blew all your science cred
0.29%:  would like that to be a real science theory!!
0.29%:  hate to be the science
0.68%:  hate to be the science guy around
0.67%:  hate to be the science guy but
0.29%:  just need to figure out how to be a science
0.29%:  could totally write a fr
0.29%:  would argue that the only reason
0.29%:  forgot about it!!
0.29%:  forgot to rule out all other
0.29%:  hate you for being such a jerk
0.45%:  hate you for being such a jerk about
0.29%:  could talk about this one for the
0.29%:  just noticed you forgot to breathe when
0.29%:  should totally write a science book for a bunch
0.29%:  like how your face just turned
0.29%:  thought you were just fant
0.29%:  just had a new theory!!
0.29%:  just got tricked by an
0.29%:  should go write about that on
0.29%:  thought about it for a second but only
0.29%:  think you just called for
0.31%:  think you just called for science
0.29%:  just talked about science with regular
0.29%:  would rate that theory about 
0.29%:  was really
0.73%:  was really looking
0.29%:  thought you were all about science and reject
0.29%:  just wrote you
0.36%:  just wrote you a science
0.29%:  think you just found her
0.29%:  could be wrong after all these
0.29%:  think you just called on
0.29%:  really like that science
0.29%:  would like that story to be true enough
0.29%:  just noticed that there
0.29%:  forgot you were the science one
0.46%:  forgot you were the science one!!
0.29%:  would like that to be the science of
0.29%:  bet dark
0.32%:  bet dark energy
0.29%:  feel like that could just about be
0.29%:  would call that an
0.29%:  think they just found
0.36%:  think they just found out
0.29%:  think we can all agree you
0.91%:  think we can all agree you just
0.40%:  think we can all agree you should
0.29%:  just broke the fourth wall by
0.29%:  totally just figured out science bro
0.29%:  think you just got real hot for science and
0.29%:  just talked about science with you for real!!
0.29%:  need to talk to you for a long
0.29%:  could totally be wrong about this here
0.31%:  could totally be wrong about this here science
0.29%:  feel like that could be science!!
0.29%:  think you just changed real science to be a
0.29%:  think you just heard science blow
0.29%:  thought for sure science would break
0.29%:  look forward to being able to lecture
0.29%:  look forward to all the science being re
0.29%:  really think there
0.29%:  should write the science book for
0.29%:  would like to close the
0.29%:  could be wrong about the science of it all but there
0.29%:  need to work on the science of
0.29%:  look forward to an
0.29%:  should really get on that book
0.29%:  gotta work
5.72%:  gotta work on that theory
4.60%:  gotta work on that theory!!
0.89%:  gotta work on that theory real
0.74%:  gotta work on that theory before
0.72%:  gotta work on that theory because
0.62%:  gotta work on that one
0.94%:  gotta work on that one!!
0.50%:  gotta work on this
1.42%:  gotta work on this theory
1.61%:  gotta work on this theory!!
0.44%:  gotta work on that science
0.42%:  gotta work on this theory before
0.35%:  gotta work on that theory for
0.79%:  gotta work on that theory for science
0.30%:  gotta work on that theory before science
0.29%:  always thought it looked cool but
0.29%:  just got a new theory about science called
0.29%:  really need to think about those
0.29%:  think we need to call our
1.18%:  think we need to call our science
0.29%:  do not know about your
0.38%:  do not know about your science
0.37%:  do not know about your science but
0.29%:  thought you were fake science bros until
0.29%:  really need to go talk to this
0.29%:  need to figure out how to science just
0.29%:  hate to break the bad news to you science
0.63%:  hate to break the bad news to you science bro
0.29%:  think we just changed science for our
0.29%:  just figured out how to take all the science on
0.29%:  really thought about it before just
0.29%:  just got blown out of the arena
0.29%:  think you just let a
0.29%:  think science just got called out on
0.29%:  just told you that gi
0.29%:  kinda forgot about you
0.29%:  would call that one
0.29%:  hate it when you talk to
0.29%:  think we just found both our
0.29%:  think you should run
0.65%:  think you should run for science
0.29%:  need to write a book about the
0.69%:  need to write a book about the science
0.29%:  could write a science book that tells
0.30%:  could write a science book that tells you
0.29%:  thought you wanted to be science bros for
0.29%:  could totally be wrong about this fr
0.29%:  think we just created a science theory for all
0.29%:  think you just had science
0.29%:  need to figure out how to bust
0.29%:  hate you for blowing
0.29%:  just figured out that we can all
0.29%:  was looking for science that could
0.29%:  thought you were d
0.29%:  just figured out that not only are we
0.29%:  need to know if
0.29%:  need to figure out how to buy science
0.29%:  could be wrong about that but the
0.29%:  thought science was totally done
0.29%:  think you just created enough science to blow
0.29%:  could be wrong about those fake
0.29%:  forget that you know science better
0.29%:  think you just created a new science to further
0.29%:  need to write all of
0.29%:  just figured out not only are
0.34%:  just figured out not only are there
0.29%:  just thought of a real world
0.30%:  just thought of a real world science
0.29%:  thought you were a robot
0.29%:  could totally be wrong about the science this
0.29%:  better call the
0.46%:  better call the science
0.29%:  could see that working for a science
0.29%:  could be the first science guy to know
0.85%:  could be the first science guy to know about
0.30%:  could be the first science guy to know about the
0.29%:  think you just wrote the great
2.45%:  think you just wrote the great science
0.29%:  thought you were a bro!!
0.29%:  would like to start a science club to
0.29%:  think you just burned the
0.38%:  think you just burned the roof
0.29%:  really thought we could just take
0.29%:  just figured the
0.32%:  just figured the whole
0.29%:  just thought of a new diet book!!
0.29%:  just blew all our dark energy
0.29%:  feel like you just brought science down a notch to be
0.29%:  think we just found our global threat
0.29%:  just got turned on to science baby
0.29%:  could be wrong about all the science before!!
0.29%:  just figured out science alone
0.36%:  just figured out science alone!!
0.29%:  just found a giant theory
0.29%:  totally just heard about
0.29%:  forgot to include that science theory!!
0.29%:  should write to
0.34%:  should write to science
0.29%:  clearly need to figure out a
0.29%:  could totally be the author
0.29%:  think you just blew all of our science to
0.29%:  really need to write science books for a
0.29%:  should totally be working on the
0.97%:  should totally be working on the science
0.41%:  should totally be working on the science of
0.29%:  forgot to include that when you
0.29%:  think you just brought all of science to a craw
0.29%:  just learned a
0.29%:  should totally be a science writer for that
0.29%:  forgot there was actual science under
0.29%:  just blew your entire science out the door
0.41%:  just blew your entire science out the door!!
0.29%:  just figured out the r
0.29%:  only just thought about it
0.29%:  thought it was science
0.29%:  think you just changed science for e
0.29%:  see your logic but
0.29%:  clearly need to write a science book so that
0.29%:  would take that theory as
0.29%:  should be the one talking to
0.29%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to another science
0.29%:  should totally go into science where
0.29%:  think you just won the science debate for about
0.29%:  was too
0.29%:  need to go to the library real fast
1.10%:  need to go to the library real fast!!
0.29%:  feel like you just bought the world
0.29%:  really should get on that book
0.29%:  totally just figured the whole science
0.29%:  wrote a story about that like
0.29%:  really should write that science book!!
0.29%:  hate you for knowing all the cool
2.54%:  hate you for knowing all the cool science
0.29%:  hate you for knowing all the cool science but
0.29%:  hate you for knowing about the science but
0.29%:  think there are
0.29%:  need to go to the bank
0.29%:  think you just wrote science fact there!!
0.29%:  would totally be the first science teacher
0.29%:  would hate to be that guy
0.29%:  need to go back to the library for that
0.47%:  need to go back to the library for that one!!
0.29%:  think you just won science for about
0.36%:  think you just won science for about three
0.29%:  think you just brought real science fact
0.29%:  told you so
0.29%:  want to hug you so hard but
0.29%:  think you just changed science or
0.29%:  could be totally wrong about science here but
0.29%:  forgot to ask about
0.29%:  just got hit by a fr
0.29%:  could be right about one other
0.29%:  should write a science book about that but
0.29%:  forgot about black holes in the
0.29%:  like the sound of that too
0.68%:  like the sound of that too!!
0.29%:  really just need to figure out how to black
0.29%:  should be the one to tell
0.29%:  cannot wait for dark
0.29%:  forgot to breathe!!
0.29%:  think you just won the global science debate tour
0.29%:  could talk about nothing for
0.44%:  could talk about nothing for hours
0.32%:  could talk about nothing for the
0.29%:  could be right about all these fake bro
0.29%:  told you science is
0.29%:  should go to the science centre for
0.29%:  really think that could be true for
0.29%:  forgot to call dark
0.29%:  forgot that you were here!!
0.29%:  should go to the science library!!
0.29%:  would like that to be the case only
0.29%:  think you just changed science all of
0.29%:  bet you just
0.38%:  bet you just thought
0.36%:  bet you just thought of dark
0.29%:  thought you were better at
1.12%:  thought you were better at science
0.29%:  cannot allow that
0.30%:  cannot allow that to be true
0.55%:  cannot allow that to be true!!
0.29%:  just figured out not only what the real
0.29%:  forgot the answer could be that science
0.29%:  think you just created a science too
0.29%:  reject that theory on grounds it
0.29%:  already regret
0.29%:  told you it was fake
0.34%:  told you it was fake!!
0.29%:  totally wrote that science
0.71%:  totally wrote that science book
0.48%:  totally wrote that science book!!
0.29%:  just got a whole bunch of dark
0.29%:  would like to turn
0.39%:  would like to turn that
0.29%:  just thought of a better way science could be like
0.29%:  would totally bet on that!!
0.29%:  think you just wrote a fr
0.29%:  should write a blog entry about that before
0.29%:  thought for sure science would be better
0.29%:  could be talking about science theory for
0.56%:  could be talking about science theory for hours
0.45%:  could be talking about science theory for hours!!
0.29%:  think we should totally get our
1.19%:  think we should totally get our science
0.29%:  refuse to think about that now
0.49%:  refuse to think about that now!!
0.29%:  think you just got too real for real
0.29%:  figured that out years
0.29%:  told you science was great!!
0.29%:  just thought of a way science could be non
0.29%:  forgot to include science theory
0.29%:  could talk about science for another twenty hours
0.29%:  just got really hot for dark
0.29%:  think you just charged
0.29%:  could be wrong about all of science theory!!
0.29%:  need to go work on that theory real
0.29%:  should really write a book about science for
0.29%:  forgot about the second rule
0.29%:  feel like you just ut
0.29%:  really should write science fact
0.29%:  really forgot about that whole science
0.29%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to science you
0.29%:  forgot there was one
0.29%:  thought you were on science break for
0.29%:  forgot to include that last one
0.66%:  forgot to include that last one!!
0.29%:  should really work on being
2.13%:  should really work on being better
15.88%:  should really work on being better at science
1.65%:  should really work on being better at science!!
0.39%:  should really work on being better about
0.33%:  should really work on being better at science fact
0.29%:  just totally figured out how to che
0.29%:  could totally write a science book on the
0.29%:  think you just science bro
0.29%:  just noticed you through
0.29%:  forgot to eat lunch while
0.29%:  look forward to all these
0.29%:  would like that to be a yes
0.29%:  could talk about science with other
0.29%:  thought you were kinda cute
0.29%:  think science just found actual
0.29%:  feel like that would change science just
0.29%:  would argue that those are not
0.29%:  hate to burst the dark
0.29%:  just totally thought of a new science book!!
0.29%:  think you just blew science a huge
0.29%:  could write a book about the journey
0.29%:  just figured out a way to tell science to
0.29%:  need to work on a
0.49%:  need to work on a theory
0.54%:  need to work on a theory for
1.74%:  need to work on a theory for that!!
0.45%:  need to work on a better
0.29%:  just gained
0.29%:  think you forgot that
0.29%:  should write a book about science f
0.29%:  just figured out black hole
2.64%:  just figured out black hole theory
2.59%:  just figured out black hole theory!!
0.29%:  was totally joking around but there
0.29%:  really thought for a second about
0.29%:  just finally
0.29%:  think you just changed all of science !!
0.29%:  always forgot
0.66%:  always forgot about the
0.29%:  really just wrote the
0.29%:  would totally be there
3.32%:  would totally be there for that!!
3.22%:  would totally be there for that science
1.11%:  would totally be there for that one
1.00%:  would totally be there for that one!!
0.79%:  would totally be there for that science!!
0.31%:  would totally be there for this
0.29%:  could be wrong on this but that
0.29%:  forgot what the letter
0.29%:  just talked about science for an entire hour
0.29%:  just figured out the science to a whole
0.29%:  think you just wrote three
0.40%:  think you just wrote three science
0.29%:  need to think about such
0.29%:  hate to break it to your face
0.29%:  was right about the fake
0.29%:  forgot to talk about why
0.29%:  need to call the science guys about that!!
0.29%:  think you just created a science for all
0.29%:  totally figured out the source
0.29%:  just need to figure out how that all
0.29%:  thought you were just a fake bro
0.29%:  could talk about these flying
0.29%:  just thought of a totally real science
0.29%:  could be wrong about science this
0.29%:  could be wrong about the rest of it but holy
0.29%:  just figured out all the science to the
0.29%:  could write a book about the truth of science
0.29%:  could be wrong about this at
0.29%:  totally need to get
0.45%:  totally need to get back
0.29%:  need to figure out how to talk science but
0.29%:  think you just robbed science of a bunch
0.29%:  reject that out of sheer
0.29%:  think you just went too hard for
1.34%:  think you just went too hard for science
0.29%:  think our science just found
0.29%:  just got all the science worked
1.41%:  just got all the science worked out for
0.68%:  just got all the science worked out for you
0.58%:  just got all the science worked out!!

0.33%:  just got all the science worked out in one
0.29%:  just heard a great theory of
0.60%:  just heard a great theory of science
0.52%:  just heard a great theory of science!!
0.29%:  just thought of a new science to learn about
0.81%:  just thought of a new science to learn about!!
0.29%:  just broke science with a
0.58%:  just broke science with a theory
1.81%:  just broke science with a theory about
0.29%:  think that could be true for sure
0.29%:  really thought we talked about science once
0.29%:  hate to be wrong about such
0.29%:  totally need to work on science
0.29%:  think you just created one for science!!
0.29%:  just got called out by science while
0.29%:  just got an idea for what to be
0.29%:  think you just found the science we all
0.29%:  thought you were neutral
0.44%:  thought you were neutral on dark
0.29%:  just got a totally new idea of
0.29%:  hate to do
0.92%:  hate to do this but
0.29%:  would totally go for those
0.29%:  already know enough about science to reject this fr
0.29%:  just figured out how science can be real
0.29%:  just ate
0.29%:  just wrote a science article on
0.33%:  just wrote a science article on the
0.29%:  really ought to know that
0.29%:  would like to get on
0.48%:  would like to get on that
0.31%:  would like to get on that bus
0.29%:  just got turned on by science which
0.29%:  thought you wanted science to
0.29%:  just got all the science without
0.29%:  would totally hang out there for
0.63%:  would totally hang out there for science
0.29%:  thought you were an adult science
0.29%:  could write a really great science book just
0.29%:  totally forgot about this new
0.29%:  just figured out what all the broken
0.33%:  just figured out what all the broken science
0.29%:  just blew science right out the back door of our
0.29%:  refuse to look at the science and
0.29%:  thought you wanted to be just
0.29%:  think you should go tell science
1.58%:  think you should go tell science about
0.29%:  just thought of a totally rock
0.29%:  should totally write a book of the
0.35%:  should totally write a book of the science
0.29%:  just got hit by a truck and now
0.29%:  thought you worked in science because
0.29%:  just got all the way into science
0.40%:  just got all the way into science before
0.29%:  hate to break this to all of science but you
0.29%:  think science just found out how to tell
0.29%:  need to go to the science library for a sec
0.29%:  think science just got really cool for about the
0.29%:  feel like you just brought science to a bar
0.29%:  could be wrong about all the science history
0.29%:  thought you were nuts for
0.29%:  forgot that the only reason
0.56%:  forgot that the only reason dark
0.29%:  just wrote a book on that theory called
0.29%:  only just now figured out that all science
0.29%:  just called you fake to
0.29%:  would like to be clear that no
0.29%:  could be wrong about all the science there but
0.29%:  just blew your science right out of the balloon!!
0.29%:  could argue
0.68%:  could argue with
2.52%:  could argue with that!!
1.76%:  could argue with that for
1.03%:  could argue with that but
0.68%:  could argue that
0.44%:  could argue with that one
0.69%:  could argue with that one for
0.50%:  could argue with that one!!
0.31%:  could argue with that for years
0.37%:  could argue with that for years!!
0.30%:  could argue that theory
0.29%:  would be the first one to call science
0.29%:  think the science just got real on

0.29%:  would like to be a guest on that
0.29%:  feel like science just went to
0.29%:  would like to counter
1.29%:  would like to counter that theory
0.29%:  need to talk to an

0.34%:  think we all just got burned by science for
0.29%:  really ought to know better
0.29%:  just thought of a better way dark
0.29%:  like the sound of that but let

0.28%:  refuse to think about what science could be
0.28%:  forgot science is totally
0.28%:  looked into that but
0.28%:  just thought of a science related career
0.28%:  just got called out by science fr
0.28%:  think we just brought science fact one
0.28%:  just walked into a science lecture for
0.28%:  think you just changed a lot of science!!
0.28%:  need to go think about what science really
0.28%:  think you just created the real science
0.28%:  forgot you could use that
0.28%:  thought you were a fake bro
0.28%:  could be wrong about the science of this one
0.30%:  could be wrong about the science of this one!!
0.28%:  think you just told a better science
0.28%:  will need
0.38%:  will need to consult
0.36%:  will need to look
0.30%:  will need to look further
0.28%:  just think about science and
0.28%:  think we could both agree
0.28%:  just figured out what the al
0.28%:  just talked about science without really
0.28%:  would totally agree but
0.28%:  think you just created another blog
0.28%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to a science
0.28%:  could be totally wrong about this fr
0.28%:  thought you were bad at science facts but
0.28%:  just got an idea for a book where they
0.41%:  just got an idea for a book where they turn
0.28%:  just broke through to a new reality!!
0.28%:  thought you were real and not
0.62%:  thought you were real and not just
0.28%:  would like that to be the best
0.28%:  think you just got blown out of the science race
0.28%:  need you to write that for
0.28%:  see through your science to
0.28%:  was totally joking before about not
0.28%:  was totally joking there but
0.28%:  thought you were killed
0.28%:  need to figure out how to really
0.28%:  just thought of a really nice science book
0.28%:  think you just won a science debate for all
0.28%:  could be talking about real science on
0.28%:  could be talking about science too
0.36%:  could be talking about science too!!
0.28%:  thought you were science factual
0.28%:  could talk about that for 
0.28%:  think you just changed all of science too!!
0.28%:  just called you fake!!
0.28%:  just figured that out alone
0.28%:  like you because
0.28%:  really just need to know about
0.28%:  need to take another
0.35%:  need to take another science
0.28%:  need to call the science folks
0.68%:  need to call the science folks right
0.88%:  need to call the science folks right away
0.41%:  need to call the science folks about
0.28%:  think you should turn
0.28%:  would rather be talking
2.66%:  would rather be talking about
1.15%:  would rather be talking about other
0.47%:  would rather be talking about the
0.28%:  just blew all your science right out of the boat!!
0.28%:  think you just rewrote the balance of all
2.07%:  think you just rewrote the balance of all science
0.97%:  think you just rewrote the balance of all science!!
0.38%:  think you just rewrote the balance of all science to
0.28%:  could be talking about science but also
0.28%:  think you just ground
0.28%:  could be totally wrong about our entire science
0.42%:  could be totally wrong about our entire science!!
0.28%:  figured that out because
0.28%:  thought you knew science before
0.28%:  think you just grabbed the ball out
0.28%:  look forward to that science article!!
0.28%:  thought we talked about all
0.28%:  think you just got a better
0.28%:  just broke science and now the future
0.28%:  really should know better than to go for
0.28%:  think the science world just got real for you
0.28%:  thought you were not a
0.50%:  thought you were not a science
0.85%:  thought you were not a science bro!!
0.36%:  thought you were not a science bro for
0.31%:  thought you were not a science bro but
0.28%:  think you found the secret to all our
0.28%:  forgot about all these other science
0.28%:  think you just science the
0.28%:  just got the idea to call
0.28%:  just broke science today!!
0.28%:  forgot that the answer to all
0.73%:  forgot that the answer to all science
0.28%:  think you just forgot about all the science!!
0.28%:  think you just drew the
0.28%:  look forward to the science article about the
0.28%:  just need to get back to the
0.71%:  just need to get back to the library
0.41%:  just need to get back to the lab
0.28%:  just argued with a science
0.28%:  laughed at you
0.28%:  just got d
0.28%:  look forward to telling the truth because
0.28%:  just ruined science for you all
0.28%:  think you just blew science out of the balloon
0.28%:  just talked about science for a long
0.28%:  think you just learned about the force
0.28%:  just won the science debate by
0.28%:  thought you were a little closer
0.28%:  hate to sound like a science guy
0.92%:  hate to sound like a science guy but that
0.28%:  really need to figure out how to b
0.28%:  think you just robbed science of all that
0.28%:  just blew all our science for
0.47%:  just blew all our science for the day
0.42%:  just blew all our science for today
0.31%:  just blew all our science for the year
0.31%:  just blew all our science for the day!!
0.31%:  just blew all our science for nothing
0.28%:  could be wrong about the reason
0.28%:  thought science was totally fake
0.28%:  should totally write a science book fact
0.28%:  cannot tell you how absurd
0.28%:  could be wrong about all of this you
0.28%:  could be wrong about the science but the joke
0.46%:  could be wrong about the science but the joke still
0.28%:  just got a new theory of science and
0.28%:  would not be against that
0.49%:  would not be against that theory
0.59%:  would not be against that theory!!
0.28%:  really should work on being better at science but
0.28%:  really need to work out the
0.93%:  really need to work out the science
1.55%:  really need to work out the science of that
0.45%:  really need to work out the science of this!!
0.40%:  really need to work out the science of that!!
0.35%:  really need to work out the science for
0.62%:  really need to work out the science for this
0.28%:  forgot about all the science words in
0.28%:  bet you could sell that for science
0.28%:  really just figured out that we
0.28%:  would kill to see that science
0.28%:  feel like that one should
0.28%:  feel like you just caught the
0.28%:  just need to write that
0.30%:  just need to write that book
0.28%:  totally forgot about this new science
0.28%:  want to be your science teacher for
0.28%:  really need to figure out how to jack
0.28%:  think we found a theory to
0.28%:  forgot what it
0.28%:  totally read
0.68%:  totally read that book
0.41%:  totally read that book!!
0.28%:  just figured out how to take all the science n
0.28%:  would like to here
0.28%:  do not know about the science there but clearly
0.28%:  always forget about science until
0.28%:  thought we could finally be
0.28%:  just figured out how to be a total
0.28%:  know there
0.28%:  feel like you just brought science down on
0.28%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to an
0.28%:  refuse to look into the
0.43%:  refuse to look into the science
0.28%:  just got turned on to science by a fr
0.28%:  just threw out a bunch of giant
0.50%:  just threw out a bunch of giant science
0.28%:  hate it when science turns out to be a
0.28%:  really need to think about that for 
0.28%:  think you just got science for the
0.28%:  forgot about all the science now
0.28%:  really need to go back to first
0.28%:  just figured out that one science theory!!
0.28%:  hate to break it to you and
0.57%:  hate to break it to you and science
0.28%:  think our science teacher was onto
0.28%:  think about that for
0.28%:  just figured out what color
0.28%:  could write a book on the theory
0.28%:  should write a science book about reject
0.28%:  just got way better
3.19%:  just got way better at science
2.20%:  just got way better at science!!
0.28%:  just got hit by a science bullet and now there
0.28%:  just got an idea for how to talk
0.28%:  wrote this book
0.31%:  wrote this book before
0.28%:  think the world just got about one
0.28%:  look forward to calling those
0.28%:  feel like you just got a whole
1.63%:  feel like you just got a whole bunch
0.28%:  need to talk to science guys about how

0.28%:  forgot to say there are
0.28%:  thought of a science
0.28%:  think you forgot about
0.34%:  think you forgot about the
0.28%:  totally just figured out the one science
0.28%:  forgot to think about science and
0.28%:  think we found our secret science
0.28%:  think you just brought science too near
0.28%:  should totally write a book on reject
0.28%:  think you just won the science debate club of
0.28%:  totally just won the science debate hour
0.28%:  just thought of a new science baby!!
0.28%:  got you there!!
0.28%:  thought you were real for like
0.28%:  just blew your science right out the back door on
0.28%:  totally feel
0.28%:  gotta think about what
0.28%:  thought you could be
0.34%:  thought you could be reason
0.28%:  could be wrong about the truth of all
0.28%:  want to be your science friend so

0.28%:  forgot there was another kind
0.28%:  kinda thought we
0.28%:  hate to sound like a science bro but there
0.28%:  totally just figured out the science we
0.28%:  could be wrong about all those other tiny
0.28%:  hate you for knowing all the best
1.13%:  hate you for knowing all the best science
0.28%:  really need to figure out how to science!!

0.28%:  think you just rewrote the science of cold
0.28%:  could be a giant!!
0.28%:  think you just blew all the science on our
0.28%:  could be wrong about this but oh
0.28%:  think our theory of science
0.85%:  think our theory of science just
0.76%:  think our theory of science just got blown
0.38%:  think our theory of science just got turned
0.28%:  just went through all of science to create
0.28%:  just told you science
0.28%:  think you just lowered the bar on science!!
0.28%:  think we gotta
0.28%:  just thought of a new body
0.28%:  think you just won the science bro debate of all

0.45%:  think we found our last science lecture
0.28%:  really should know better than to bet science
0.28%:  think you are a
0.28%:  forgot all about the recent theory
0.28%:  think you just found what to
0.28%:  could get really into that for
0.28%:  would totally be there for such
0.28%:  just figured out non
0.28%:  think you just blew all of science bro
0.28%:  really should get out of town
0.28%:  think you just created a new brother
0.28%:  really need to figure out what science books to
0.28%:  think we just found truth!!
0.28%:  think the word
0.28%:  just figured out where all that non
0.28%:  will do
0.31%:  will do science
0.28%:  think you just won our science battle ro
0.28%:  like you for the
0.28%:  need to watch science
0.28%:  forgot to say that when

0.28%:  would like to go on a
0.28%:  think you just brought down science or
0.28%:  forgot how to breathe and

0.28%:  totally just figured out how a science
0.28%:  figured out the secret about
0.28%:  thought about it for a second but no!!

0.56%:  should write that guy a book
0.43%:  should write that guy a letter!!
0.28%:  think you just brought science to bear to
0.28%:  forgot that science could be so
0.28%:  could be talking to the future science star
0.28%:  like that guy!!

0.28%:  used to think you were a science bro but then
0.28%:  think you just got a bunch of science to
0.28%:  would buy tickets for the
0.28%:  need to work on that theory a
0.28%:  think you just got another science award
0.28%:  would like that to be the current
0.28%:  really need to look into the science of what
0.28%:  just think about how
0.28%:  think we just touched
0.28%:  could be wrong about the science before
0.28%:  think we all just bought
0.28%:  just noticed how great
0.28%:  just wrote a book and then
0.28%:  just called you out for being the science
0.35%:  just called you out for being the science bro

0.28%:  need to talk to this guy later
0.45%:  need to talk to this guy later!!
0.28%:  would like to steal
1.16%:  would like to steal that theory
0.63%:  would like to steal that theory for
0.74%:  would like to steal that theory for science
0.39%:  would like to steal that theory!!
0.28%:  just figured out how to tell the cool
0.28%:  think you just heard a science fact get
0.53%:  think you just heard a science fact get blown
0.28%:  thought about it for only
0.54%:  thought about it for only a second but
0.28%:  just got all the way to the end for
0.28%:  just had a full blown
0.30%:  just had a full blown org
0.28%:  think you just created science to
0.28%:  hate that you just broke down all

0.28%:  feel like we should try that!!
0.28%:  really should be better about
0.28%:  think you are both wrong
0.28%:  thought you were for science but
0.28%:  should totally write a science future
1.08%:  should totally write a science future book
0.43%:  should totally write a science future book!!
0.28%:  just got hit by a car!!

0.36%:  think you just rewrote a bunch of science to tell
0.31%:  think you just rewrote a bunch of science to let
0.28%:  really just thought about science for no
0.28%:  was totally doing that before
0.28%:  hate to be the one to bring you all
0.28%:  could be wrong about at
1.03%:  could be wrong about at least three

0.33%:  could be wrong about at least one of
0.28%:  think you just won the dollar
0.28%:  think we just created science bro
0.28%:  would like to further note
0.29%:  would like to further note that science
0.28%:  need to talk to this guy for real!!
0.28%:  could argue that too
0.28%:  just got a whole bunch better at science for real
0.28%:  totally need to figure out how to crash
0.34%:  totally need to figure out how to crash science

0.29%:  just got one of the
0.28%:  think you just got real science!!
0.28%:  just called you out for being real
0.28%:  just figured out the science to black
0.28%:  would like for that to be the best science

0.29%:  just talked about science for a while there!!
0.28%:  forgot all about dark theory!!
0.28%:  really need to talk about gi
0.28%:  forgot to say that science
0.28%:  totally should write a science book or
0.28%:  just got hit by science fact
0.28%:  think you just won the science but
0.28%:  should get a job at the science center or
0.28%:  thought you just liked
0.43%:  thought you just liked science
0.28%:  think you just found the science error
0.28%:  look forward to using the science
0.28%:  hate to break it to ya

0.28%:  think you just learned how to be cool
0.28%:  totally need to figure out how to break
0.28%:  really think that could be our new
0.28%:  could write a story for
0.28%:  just got real science theory
0.28%:  look forward to hearing the science to
0.28%:  could totally be working on the science for
0.38%:  could totally be working on the science for the
0.28%:  should write a science book you
0.28%:  look forward to science telling us that you
0.28%:  just figured out where all the baby
0.28%:  think we just got real science!!

1.24%:  feel really bad about
0.28%:  look forward to trying out
0.28%:  thought you were real for a second but no
0.28%:  just wrote a theory of science that
0.28%:  just thought of science you
0.35%:  just thought of science you can
0.28%:  just figured out what the block
0.28%:  hate you because
0.28%:  thought you read science books but now
0.28%:  hate to break this to you but we could
0.28%:  cannot take
0.28%:  just got the fun
0.28%:  used to think you were cooler than science!!
0.28%:  just created a theory for science that
0.28%:  totally forgot it
0.42%:  totally forgot it was science
0.28%:  really thought we could use science to be
0.28%:  could say
0.49%:  could say that
0.28%:  totally forgot to use
0.33%:  totally forgot to use dark
0.28%:  could be wrong about the latter
0.28%:  was trying to talk about science
0.28%:  just got a science boner real bad

0.28%:  need to talk to all the science guys who
0.28%:  could totally be right about two
0.28%:  think you just learned how to be science
0.28%:  think science just got harder for all

0.28%:  just broke through all reality
0.28%:  think you just lowered the cool
0.28%:  just forgot all about how dark
0.28%:  just got a whole bunch of science on
0.28%:  need to learn about this

0.28%:  just got a whole bunch of really
0.28%:  totally wrote a book about this
1.00%:  totally wrote a book about this!!
0.28%:  just threw out a bunch of science like nobody
0.28%:  just threw out a theory about science
0.28%:  just got another idea for where
0.28%:  should write a book about the 
0.28%:  laughed out
0.28%:  need to figure out a way to talk
0.28%:  forgot you know about the
0.66%:  forgot you know about the science

0.28%:  think you just let science fall
0.28%:  should look that one
0.28%:  thought you were s
0.28%:  totally just figured out three
0.28%:  thought you worked on
0.28%:  think science just threw
0.28%:  should totally be working at the

0.28%:  should get into
2.05%:  should get into science
0.50%:  should get into science!!
0.28%:  feel like science just got way cooler to
0.28%:  just got called out by science for what
0.27%:  would think about that for a longer

0.27%:  just called you a fake bro in
0.27%:  just thought of a little
0.27%:  think we just found out they
0.27%:  think you just got a better science
0.27%:  could be talking about real science to
0.27%:  just talked about science for that
0.79%:  just talked about science for that whole

0.27%:  think you just won science at
0.32%:  think you just won science at large
0.31%:  think you just won science at the
0.27%:  thought for sure you were science
0.27%:  could write a book just to tell
0.27%:  should write a science book that no

0.27%:  just thought of a really rad science book to
4.01%:  just thought of a really rad science book to write!!
0.27%:  should write a science book but then all
0.27%:  think you just found a great career
0.27%:  just thought of a new science to build
0.27%:  forgot the only

0.27%:  just got an idea for how to che
0.27%:  was about to change
0.27%:  just blew your life
0.27%:  just figured out how to alter the science
0.27%:  could go on
0.61%:  could go on about
0.89%:  could go on about this all
0.73%:  could go on about this for the
0.45%:  could go on about that

0.27%:  feel like you just charged
0.27%:  need to borrow your black hole science
0.27%:  really just wrote out the
0.27%:  look forward to eating these
0.27%:  just thought of science to counter
0.27%:  gotta write a story

0.36%:  just got a whole bunch of better at science in
0.33%:  just got a whole bunch of better at science real
0.27%:  just figured out all at
2.31%:  just figured out all at once how
1.56%:  just figured out all at once why
1.55%:  just figured out all at once what science
1.36%:  just figured out all at once how science
1.32%:  just figured out all at once how to
1.03%:  just figured out all at once that
0.86%:  just figured out all at once how the
0.73%:  just figured out all at once why there

0.27%:  need to figure out how to shut all
0.27%:  just blew all your science out of the back door
0.27%:  only just now figured out the real
0.27%:  was totally right but
0.27%:  forgot there was a theory
0.61%:  forgot there was a theory about
0.27%:  thought you were just trick
0.27%:  forgot about that one while
0.27%:  would like to use
1.50%:  would like to use that theory
1.10%:  would like to use that theory for
0.51%:  would like to use that theory for science
0.27%:  just got turned on to the whole
0.32%:  just got turned on to the whole science
0.27%:  totally just broke through into
0.27%:  look forward to the science lecture that is
0.27%:  reject the notion that you
0.29%:  reject the notion that you would
0.27%:  do not know the science of
0.27%:  feel like you just wrote out
0.27%:  hate to agree
3.42%:  hate to agree with you but
0.29%:  hate to agree with you on
0.32%:  hate to agree with you on science
0.33%:  hate to agree with you on science but
0.27%:  was born to argue about
0.27%:  really need to work on those science
0.27%:  want to hug you!!
0.27%:  thought you liked science because
0.27%:  just got really into the science for the
0.27%:  just fell down a rabbit hole on
0.27%:  need to work on that theory real fast
0.70%:  need to work on that theory real fast!!
0.27%:  forgot to rule out that science
0.27%:  think you better watch out for science
0.27%:  need to think before
0.27%:  forgot you were a science bro until just that
0.27%:  hate to burst your flight
0.27%:  just got an idea for how to tell science
0.27%:  need to figure out how to sell science

0.27%:  would like to shoot
0.27%:  hate to be the guy to ruin
0.27%:  just got hit by one of the world
0.27%:  just got a new theory about science for the
0.27%:  think about that one
0.27%:  would like to close out
0.27%:  really just wrote that to
0.27%:  should write a science lecture book about that
0.50%:  should write a science lecture book about that!!
0.27%:  thought you cared about science for real!!
0.27%:  told you that science
0.28%:  told you that science was
0.27%:  think you just won a gold
0.27%:  truly
0.27%:  totally forgot there was other science!!
0.27%:  like your science better than the
0.27%:  think you were just born to be a great
0.29%:  think you were just born to be a great science
0.27%:  really need to figure out how to talk just
0.27%:  totally just figured out how to science black
0.27%:  think you just tore down the science
0.27%:  totally just wrote a book and
0.27%:  should go to the science centre!!
0.27%:  would be the first to call science
0.28%:  would be the first to call science on that!!
0.27%:  think we just learned about science for real
0.27%:  think you just won the science lecture tro
0.27%:  think you just blew out the candle of
0.46%:  think you just blew out the candle of science
0.27%:  created a theory
0.67%:  created a theory of science
0.27%:  forgot to call in
0.27%:  would still argue that theory
0.27%:  really thought about it!!
0.27%:  need to think about how true
0.27%:  want to go to the library and
0.28%:  want to go to the library and look
0.27%:  already bought
0.27%:  should write about that for science blog!!
0.27%:  think we just got a science
0.62%:  think we just got a science theory
0.31%:  think we just got a science theory!!
0.28%:  think we just got a science theory for
0.27%:  forgot to notice dark
0.27%:  just ignored all your counter
0.27%:  think you just forgot about all science
0.27%:  hate to burst your balloon of science but the
0.27%:  could write a book about all the science these
0.27%:  was born to figure out that dark
0.27%:  think you just blew science out of a hole
0.27%:  think that could just be real!!
0.27%:  think you just got the real science world
0.27%:  need to figure out how to break science
0.27%:  need to go to the science library or
0.27%:  think that could well
1.04%:  think that could well be true
0.88%:  think that could well be true!!
0.27%:  look forward to this science lecture!!
0.27%:  just called you on
0.27%:  would like for that to be true but science has
0.27%:  just figured out how to cheat on science by
0.27%:  was totally joking before but science can
0.27%:  know science
0.27%:  look forward to ret
0.27%:  just figured out the only real science
0.27%:  would like to see your science for
1.14%:  would like to see your science for that!!
0.44%:  would like to see your science for that one
0.47%:  would like to see your science for that one!!
0.27%:  thought science was fake too until
0.27%:  would like to return to the subject of baby
0.27%:  could talk about science for another hour
0.27%:  just called you out for knowing that
0.27%:  totally forgot that science works
0.27%:  need to go think about how science really
0.27%:  know you thought science
0.27%:  just thought of a way it could all be science!!
0.27%:  just got called out by the real
0.27%:  just wrote a science book for the general
0.27%:  think you just won the global debate!!
0.27%:  need to start looking for the
0.27%:  only thought about it
0.49%:  only thought about it for a
3.34%:  only thought about it for a second but
0.71%:  only thought about it for a second!!
0.45%:  only thought about it because
0.27%:  really need to talk to her
0.69%:  really need to talk to her about
0.27%:  just wrote a science book that changed your
2.42%:  just wrote a science book that changed your life!!
0.32%:  just wrote a science book that changed your entire
0.27%:  think we should forget science
0.27%:  could be totally wrong here but this
0.27%:  should go into
1.71%:  should go into science
0.41%:  should go into science!!
0.29%:  should go into science after
1.26%:  should go into science after all!!
0.27%:  just thought of two really cool
0.52%:  just thought of two really cool science
0.27%:  think we just found science truth
0.27%:  would totally go for this one
0.27%:  just thought of you in
0.27%:  forgot there was science behind all
0.27%:  kind of want that to be the case!!
0.27%:  totally just blew our friend
0.27%:  think we just found a science theory to call
0.27%:  need to talk to science now
0.37%:  need to talk to science now!!
0.27%:  just figured out how to talk science at a
0.27%:  was about to call the flying
0.27%:  need to figure out how to burn science
0.27%:  could talk for hours about giant bro
0.27%:  would argue that you are both
0.27%:  just wrote a book and then you
0.27%:  need to talk to the authors of science
0.27%:  just noticed that the
0.27%:  gotta look
0.74%:  gotta look into that!!
0.27%:  could talk about nothing else for a
0.27%:  should write a book about theory science
0.27%:  think we all just found our real
0.27%:  found the last
0.27%:  was totally right there
0.39%:  was totally right there!!
0.36%:  was totally right there for
0.27%:  think we just found our global theory
0.27%:  feel like that could be worthy
0.27%:  would like to hug you both
0.27%:  think you just turned all of science to
0.27%:  would like to return to the subject of a
0.27%:  just found out that all the
0.80%:  just found out that all the science
0.27%:  like the sound of the science
0.27%:  think we just found our science theory to
0.27%:  feel like you just doubt
0.27%:  feel like you just brought science to a halt
0.27%:  really need to look into the science of that
0.27%:  hate when
0.48%:  hate when science
0.45%:  hate when you
0.27%:  hate when you do
0.27%:  should get out of the science career
0.27%:  need to write books about science
0.27%:  think science just got all of
0.27%:  just figured out how to balance all science
0.27%:  look forward to science being really
0.27%:  can finally get
0.27%:  always thought it could be rubber
0.27%:  feel like you just blew a bunch
0.27%:  can say
0.66%:  can say without
0.75%:  can say without doubt

0.77%:  forget that you know about the science
0.27%:  totally just got blown
0.27%:  just blew all your science out of the dark
0.27%:  think you just lowered the bar too
0.27%:  like your science better than the actual
0.27%:  think our science teacher just got all
0.27%:  think you just won our debate for the
0.27%:  could write a book about the theory!!
0.27%:  hate to break it to us all but
0.27%:  totally just got owned!!
0.27%:  could be the first to know
0.65%:  could be the first to know about
0.58%:  could be the first to know about the
0.29%:  could be the first to know about the real
0.27%:  feel like science just got two
0.27%:  look forward to the science lecture on that being
0.27%:  just blew all our science right out of the boat
0.29%:  just blew all our science right out of the boat!!

1.49%:  refuse to go down that
289.94%:  refuse to go down that rabbit hole!!
0.94%:  refuse to go down that rabbit hole but
0.64%:  refuse to go down that rabbit hole you
0.27%:  would just like to be clear that the science of
0.27%:  think we all just agreed on the
0.27%:  just got turned on by science to
0.27%:  just created a working
6.69%:  just created a working theory of science
3.91%:  just created a working theory of science!!
3.51%:  just created a working theory of science that
3.28%:  just created a working theory of the
0.54%:  just created a working theory about
0.53%:  just created a working theory about the
0.37%:  just created a working theory of both
0.69%:  just created a working theory of both science
0.27%:  would like that to count as science
0.27%:  can barely breathe!!
0.27%:  could be right about all of that
0.27%:  think you just threw a log
0.27%:  was totally joking before but that one could
0.27%:  cannot tell you how delight
0.27%:  just hit on
0.27%:  just got hit by dark
0.27%:  just figured out totally
0.62%:  just figured out totally what
0.27%:  would rather be struck
2.53%:  would rather be struck by a falling
0.40%:  would rather be struck by a giant
0.34%:  would rather be struck by light
0.27%:  really should get back to science when
0.27%:  should totally be a science writer for the enc
0.27%:  like you but that was
0.27%:  was about to be like
0.27%:  just went through science to
0.27%:  feel like that could be wrong!!
0.27%:  finally get dark
0.27%:  should totally write a book for teenage
0.27%:  clearly need to start looking for a
0.32%:  clearly need to start looking for a job
0.27%:  should write a science book before that guy!!
0.27%:  could totally use that in a science
0.27%:  think you just let science out of the bag and we
0.35%:  think you just let science out of the bag and we all
0.27%:  just went through your entire science
0.27%:  bet you thought science would take
0.27%:  like the sound of that science but
0.27%:  could be wrong about the science but that feels
0.27%:  feel like you just brought science to town
0.40%:  feel like you just brought science to town and
0.27%:  should write a science book before they
0.27%:  should get out of the science r
0.27%:  just got hit by the science bullet of
0.27%:  thought you were still at
0.27%:  just blew all our energy on
0.43%:  just blew all our energy on that
0.27%:  just got called out for science bro
0.27%:  gotta talk to you later
0.27%:  forgot that you were born
0.27%:  totally just figured out what al
0.27%:  just got really into science before
0.27%:  just blew your entire god
0.27%:  just wrote a science book that could be true
0.27%:  only just figured out how science
0.27%:  do not recall asking you
0.27%:  need to write a book just to tell
0.27%:  could be right about these fake bro
0.27%:  thought you were just a real
0.27%:  reject that theory on two
4.17%:  reject that theory on two grounds
0.67%:  reject that theory on two grounds!!
0.27%:  think you just won the great debate for
0.29%:  think you just won the great debate for science
0.27%:  think we just had a great
0.27%:  think we found the cause
0.27%:  hate to be the one to burst all our science
0.27%:  wrote a book about this and
0.27%:  would think about that for years!!
0.27%:  think you just fell down science
0.27%:  would like to get that theory
0.27%:  would argue that both
0.27%:  just figured out that black hole science
0.27%:  should totally write that for science!!
0.27%:  should write a book about science but for
0.27%:  need to think about all these
0.27%:  need to talk about this to
0.27%:  think you just won the global race

0.27%:  wrote a science book and you
0.49%:  wrote a science book and you just
0.27%:  totally just figured out how 
0.27%:  think you just went full bro
0.27%:  really just wanted to be right about science
0.79%:  really just wanted to be right about science for
7.14%:  really just wanted to be right about science for once!!
0.27%:  would not be able to reject
0.42%:  would not be able to reject this
0.27%:  feel like that just got real science
0.27%:  totally just heard the future being
1.43%:  totally just heard the future being born!!
0.27%:  think you just brought science and al
0.27%:  look forward to that lecture in
0.27%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to science but
0.27%:  need to start talking to you
0.27%:  forgot to include that one but
0.27%:  really just figured out how black
0.27%:  only just now thought to
0.27%:  could be wrong about the fate
0.27%:  just figured out how to not be an
0.27%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole you are
0.27%:  could talk about science but
0.27%:  think you just won both
1.10%:  think you just won both science
0.27%:  forgot to rule out black holes in the
0.27%:  could be totally wrong about both science
0.27%:  could go either way on that one but
0.27%:  forgot you know about that
0.27%:  need to go call science
0.27%:  just thought of a science book you
1.51%:  just thought of a science book you can write
1.42%:  just thought of a science book you can write!!
0.27%:  think we just created science theory out
0.30%:  think we just created science theory out of our
0.27%:  really hate to be the first
0.27%:  think you just won science for the regular
0.27%:  just figured out where all that cool
0.52%:  just figured out where all that cool science
0.27%:  thought you were naked
0.27%:  just got all the science out of the
0.59%:  just got all the science out of the way in
0.49%:  just got all the science out of the way in order
0.46%:  just got all the science out of the way and

0.27%:  think you just changed two of our
0.27%:  kind of want that to be true because holy
0.27%:  do not know that
0.27%:  feel really good about this science
0.27%:  think you just bro science
0.27%:  should totally go into science now!!
0.27%:  could write a book about these really
0.27%:  need to go think about such
0.27%:  think you just rewrote all science fact
0.27%:  really want to reject
0.27%:  would like to get a science
0.27%:  forgot all about science and just
0.27%:  thought you were cool and science
0.27%:  should write a book about science but not really!!
0.27%:  hate it when science does
0.27%:  need to write a science blog!!
0.27%:  can feel the science world shaking!!

0.27%:  would not be the slight
0.27%:  think you just created a science to
0.27%:  told you science was the cool

0.27%:  just thought of a radical new science book
0.27%:  just got bored
0.27%:  need to tell you later how right
0.27%:  would like to be the last to hear
0.27%:  totally think we just found our
0.27%:  think you just got a free science
0.89%:  think you just got a free science lecture
0.51%:  think you just got a free science lecture!!
0.27%:  forgot about the black hole in your
0.27%:  said they
1.19%:  said they were fake bro
0.86%:  said they were fake!!
0.42%:  said they were fake but
0.27%:  think our theory of science just got real
0.27%:  need to talk with you for hours about science
0.27%:  think you just found science all the better
0.27%:  hate to burst your black

0.27%:  already knew about the
0.27%:  think you just went to the science
0.27%:  think you just got a new science
0.27%:  just thought about it for one
0.27%:  look forward to these being the
0.47%:  look forward to these being the only

0.27%:  think you just blew science to hell
0.27%:  think you just won the science record
0.27%:  could be wrong about a lot of science this
0.27%:  always forget about the science!!

0.27%:  just got an idea for how they
0.27%:  just figured out where all the cart
0.52%:  just figured out where all the cartoon science
0.27%:  forgot about black holes and white
0.27%:  look forward to using that theory at
0.46%:  look forward to using that theory at science
0.27%:  forgot to write about
0.34%:  forgot to write about dark
0.27%:  now regret
0.27%:  just got called out on science by freak
0.27%:  forgot about the actual science theory
0.27%:  thought you were outside!!

0.27%:  reject this theory out of an
0.27%:  wrote a science book and then
0.58%:  wrote a science book and then forgot
0.27%:  just figured out how to be all the cool
0.39%:  just figured out how to be all the cool science
0.27%:  just need to figure out how to lock
0.27%:  should get into science after

0.27%:  need to figure out what to call those
0.27%:  think science just found out a whole
0.27%:  should totally go into science when
0.27%:  would call that the best science joke of our

0.27%:  really need to figure out how to block that science
0.27%:  think you just won the science t
0.27%:  need to figure out how to track all
0.27%:  would not be against that!!
0.27%:  think we just found a theory about science

0.27%:  totally just blew the science out
0.27%:  only wish
0.27%:  could totally be wrong there!!

0.27%:  should write a science book for the younger
0.27%:  think you just got called a
0.27%:  need to figure out how all
0.27%:  would call that theory science
0.27%:  just figured out what the one
0.27%:  just got hit by a nuclear science bullet!!
0.27%:  should write a book that counter
0.27%:  already know enough about science to be rich
0.27%:  totally bought that for like 
0.27%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole bro!!
0.27%:  look forward to all your science being
0.27%:  just figured out a totally new science!!
0.27%:  should really take that
0.27%:  think science just won the battle of our

0.27%:  look forward to hearing about the subject
0.27%:  just woke
0.27%:  think you just narrow

0.41%:  just figured out a way to let science
0.27%:  hate you for knowing about that science but
0.27%:  refuse to go down that route
0.27%:  thought for sure it would be a better
0.27%:  really should know better than to force
0.46%:  really should know better than to force science
0.27%:  thought you said to
0.27%:  totally just figured out what a science
0.27%:  just need you to know that if there
0.27%:  would not say
0.27%:  totally just figured out how to be a real science hero
0.27%:  think you just blew that science
0.27%:  could finally get that
0.27%:  thought you knew all about science too

0.27%:  feel like science just got real hard!!
0.27%:  just got talked out of an entire
0.27%:  think science just got way too
0.68%:  think science just got way too real
0.27%:  think science just got way too real!!

0.26%:  just figured out how not to be a
0.26%:  just thought of it and your
0.26%:  just thought about a new kind

0.26%:  thought you were broken
0.26%:  think you just won science gold
0.26%:  really thought it would just be fake
0.26%:  should write a letter to a
3.71%:  should write a letter to a science
0.26%:  need to figure out how to science all the
0.26%:  think our science just got a
0.97%:  think our science just got a whole
0.29%:  think our science just got a whole lot real
0.26%:  just broke science with a theory of
0.26%:  bet you could get a science book
0.26%:  could be wrong about the last 
0.26%:  could argue that one for
0.33%:  could argue that one for hours
0.26%:  thought you were just f
0.26%:  forgot about all the science and just
0.26%:  think you just blew all our science for that one
0.26%:  should write a book about the nature of science
0.28%:  should write a book about the nature of science!!
0.26%:  looked into that before!!
0.26%:  feel like we both
1.18%:  feel like we both just got
0.56%:  feel like we both just got our
0.59%:  feel like we both just got our science
0.47%:  feel like we both just had
0.45%:  feel like we both just got our science on

0.26%:  could be right about to
0.26%:  should really get to work on that before
0.26%:  need to talk to this guy about our
0.26%:  feel like the science world just got an
0.26%:  would like that theory to be real just
0.31%:  would like that theory to be real just for
0.26%:  could get really into that science!!
0.26%:  just thought of a new science to talk
0.26%:  think you just found a cool

0.26%:  should write a book then!!
0.26%:  only just figured out where that
0.26%:  look forward to all the great
1.72%:  look forward to all the great science
0.59%:  look forward to all the great science you
0.26%:  would not rule out that as
0.26%:  could be wrong about all of this then
0.28%:  could be wrong about all of this then!!
0.26%:  should write a book about the central
0.26%:  would totally go to a
0.50%:  would totally go to a science
0.26%:  think that would just be science
0.26%:  do not want to talk about science
0.26%:  forgot to tell you the answer!!

0.76%:  think science just got a bunch better
0.49%:  think science just got a bunch better!!
0.26%:  think you just blew science out of the bag
0.26%:  think science just found out what real
0.26%:  could be wrong about the real nature of science
0.50%:  could be wrong about the real nature of science!!
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all science and the
0.26%:  think you just created real science out of real
0.26%:  just yelled at
0.26%:  forgot to answer your
0.26%:  hate to burst your balloon here but if
0.26%:  figured out the answer!!
0.26%:  like you better for that

0.26%:  was about to tell you to fuck
0.36%:  was about to tell you to fuck right
0.26%:  really should take a
0.38%:  really should take a science
0.26%:  just got called out for science by an alien!!
0.26%:  think they just got science
0.26%:  do not like that you just blew
0.26%:  always figured that out
0.26%:  just need to figure out how to rec
0.26%:  hate to be rude but you know
0.26%:  already know enough about science just to tell
0.26%:  thought you would take
0.26%:  already know enough science for that
1.28%:  already know enough science for that to be true
2.13%:  already know enough science for that to be true!!
0.26%:  totally should be a science teacher but
0.26%:  would hug you for that one
0.26%:  would still be
0.26%:  would like to be that guy that
0.26%:  should write a book about the only true science fact!!
0.26%:  think we just found our science teacher!!
0.26%:  need to get to the science library to
0.26%:  thought you wanted to kill
0.26%:  think we all just got our science bon
0.26%:  think you just forgot how to be real
0.26%:  just figured out the science to how
0.26%:  should write a science book for totally
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all science to agree
0.26%:  think you were just born to be a science doctor!!
0.26%:  could be wrong about the rest of science theory but

0.26%:  look forward to being unable to rule
0.36%:  look forward to being unable to rule that
0.26%:  feel like you just went too hard on that
0.26%:  just talked about science for real
0.26%:  just thought of like ten science
0.26%:  just thought about a science idea!!
0.26%:  really need to look into the science of that!!
0.26%:  just figured out how non
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all the science bro!!
0.26%:  just need you to know that all
0.26%:  hate to be the one to do

0.49%:  could still be wrong about the
0.37%:  could still be wrong about that
0.26%:  could totally go for one
0.26%:  just blew all your science right out of that
0.26%:  forgot that you could use
1.75%:  forgot that you could use science
0.26%:  cannot tell if you are just
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all of science there!!
0.26%:  totally forgot we had science to
0.26%:  look forward to seeing all the science on
0.26%:  totally need to borrow
0.26%:  think you better call science and
0.26%:  just heard science talk for
0.26%:  just figured out all the science now
0.26%:  just thought of an entire science career!!
0.26%:  could be totally wrong about this science but
0.26%:  forgot to rule out that!!
0.26%:  just figured out how to create the science
0.26%:  hate to break it to you science nerds but we
0.31%:  hate to break it to you science nerds but we call
0.26%:  think you just heard science fact
0.26%:  want that book
0.26%:  really ought to write a science book and
0.26%:  forgot all about the other kinds
0.26%:  could be wrong about that but the science
0.26%:  could talk about science for a while
0.26%:  need to be careful about what science
0.72%:  need to be careful about what science books
0.26%:  thought you were all science bros before
0.26%:  really should go back to the future

0.26%:  could totally be right about one of the science
0.26%:  just got the idea for a book where
0.26%:  just called you out for being the real
0.26%:  think you just let science down for all
0.26%:  really want that to be true for once

0.26%:  hate to burst your balloon right
0.70%:  hate to burst your balloon right now but
0.26%:  just broke through science to create an
0.26%:  could be wrong about all the science just to
0.26%:  just got called out in science by the
0.26%:  really should be out
0.56%:  really should be out there working
0.60%:  really should be out there working on science
0.26%:  totally just figured out non
0.26%:  just figured out what that one
0.26%:  would like for that to be your last
0.26%:  hate to burst your science balloon but we
0.26%:  looked into that before but
0.26%:  would like that to be real!!
0.26%:  just figured out how to be both a real science
0.26%:  could be totally wrong here for
0.26%:  forgot to rule out black holes that
0.26%:  thought of a new science
0.26%:  forgot to count this
0.26%:  could write a story about that one

0.26%:  used to think you were a science bro but after
0.26%:  look forward to that science lecture being a
0.26%:  would really rather not go that
0.26%:  just think about the word
0.26%:  thought you were born to
0.26%:  could be wrong about this but no
0.26%:  only just figured out how to take
0.26%:  bet you could get a job with that science
0.26%:  should write a book about true
1.15%:  should write a book about true science
0.26%:  need to science this
0.31%:  need to science this theory
0.26%:  need to start talking to fewer

0.25%:  only just figured out that we
0.25%:  think we just found a great science theory
0.25%:  totally just won the science race for
0.25%:  forgot that one because
0.25%:  just figured out that not only are we all
0.25%:  think we all just found true science
0.25%:  barely
0.69%:  barely know
0.25%:  could be right about all those fake

0.25%:  just got science blown
0.33%:  just got science blown out
0.25%:  would like that to be the reason for our
0.25%:  do not think there
0.25%:  forgot that we already
0.25%:  really just don
0.25%:  think you just won the science debate club for a
0.25%:  would say that science
0.25%:  just thought of a new one
0.25%:  think you just got science for lunch

0.25%:  already knew about this but
1.10%:  already knew about this but forgot
0.25%:  just thought of a cool way to be
0.25%:  forgot that science is about
0.25%:  was looking for a theory
0.59%:  was looking for a theory that could
0.58%:  was looking for a theory that could be
0.25%:  just freaked out about how science
0.25%:  forgot about all the science you knew
0.25%:  forgot about this when
0.25%:  think our theory of science just got all
0.25%:  only just noticed that
0.25%:  forgot about that article
0.25%:  feel like you just watched too
0.25%:  forgot all about outer
0.25%:  totally just figured out what science can be
0.25%:  feel like you could just be
0.25%:  could be wrong about that but holy
0.25%:  look forward to hearing about science
0.25%:  just thought of a way to burn
0.25%:  forgot to be sar
0.25%:  totally just broke science for real with
0.25%:  just got really into science for once
0.25%:  just broke the fourth wall you
0.25%:  think we just got our theory of science
0.25%:  look forward to us
0.34%:  look forward to us being
0.25%:  forgot you were the best
0.30%:  forgot you were the best science
0.27%:  forgot you were the best science bro
0.25%:  forgot to tell you about this!!
0.25%:  could be wrong about the science but that is one of
0.25%:  hate you for knowing all those

0.25%:  just found another way
0.30%:  just found another way to be
1.35%:  just found another way to be right

0.38%:  just broke the giant theory!!
0.25%:  finally got to use
0.25%:  feel like you just wrote a bunch
0.25%:  think you just tore down all
1.03%:  think you just tore down all the science
0.25%:  could be wrong about the science for only
0.25%:  totally just learned what
0.25%:  just got the science boner of the
0.25%:  think science just got an
0.25%:  need to call science about that
0.25%:  feel like we just had a science
0.25%:  would just like to be able
0.25%:  really should know about that science before
0.25%:  thought you were all science before but
0.25%:  would call your
0.25%:  will be honest
0.25%:  feel like you just robbed a bunch
0.25%:  finally know the
1.17%:  finally know the secret

0.25%:  think science just found real
0.25%:  would just like to note that before you
0.25%:  need to figure out how to turn those
0.25%:  totally just figured out how to learn science!!
0.25%:  should look into the
1.24%:  should look into the science
0.25%:  just figured out that no
0.25%:  think you just got the science for real
0.25%:  just figured out what science call
0.25%:  think you just learned about both
1.52%:  think you just learned about both science

0.25%:  totally want to go
0.28%:  totally want to go back
0.25%:  see your light
0.25%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole you got
0.25%:  need science to figure out how to reach

0.25%:  feel like we could go
0.25%:  thought you were an adult for
0.25%:  forgot to include that all
0.25%:  just had another science
0.47%:  just had another science break
0.25%:  just created a theory for what
0.25%:  look forward to telling science that the
0.25%:  hate to be right
0.35%:  hate to be right about
0.25%:  just walked into a science lecture about
0.25%:  think science just found a way to call
0.25%:  need to talk to the science bro who
