3.26%:  just got totally owned
3.26%:  would really
3.26%:  would like that to be true but
3.26%:  just got an idea for a theory!!
3.25%:  could totally be wrong about science for
3.24%:  think you just brought science to an
4.24%:  think you just brought science to an all

3.19%:  think we found out
3.19%:  like that theory!!
3.19%:  should write a science book for young
3.18%:  could totally be wrong about the science there!!
3.18%:  just figured out where the black
3.18%:  should write a science book but only
3.17%:  just thought of two
3.17%:  just totally thought
10.51%:  just totally thought of dark

2.75%:  feel like we
6.41%:  feel like we should
3.65%:  feel like we just got
2.75%:  forgot to include science

2.63%:  just figured out where to
2.63%:  just figured out what all the science on
2.63%:  could totally be wrong about the entire science
2.62%:  should write a book about science but change
2.62%:  just figured out why black
2.62%:  think you should get a job at science
2.61%:  could be wrong about all other
2.61%:  think you just un
2.61%:  think you just won the debate about
2.61%:  feel like science
20.72%:  feel like science just got
10.91%:  feel like science just got real
7.81%:  feel like science just got way
13.11%:  feel like science just got way cool

2.59%:  think you just turned the science
2.59%:  just figured out how to be the only science
2.58%:  really just wanted to get
2.58%:  feel like that theory
4.68%:  feel like that theory just
4.31%:  feel like that theory could
2.58%:  just figured out how to be both science
2.58%:  need to talk to you right now about
2.57%:  should totally write a book before
2.57%:  think you just brought down science for real
2.57%:  just figured out all science at
2.57%:  gotta say
2.57%:  forgot to include all

2.52%:  could totally be wrong about the science for
2.52%:  think we found our science theory
2.52%:  need to think about all
2.52%:  just wrote science
2.52%:  think that could be our
2.76%:  think that could be our best
2.56%:  think that could be our answer
2.54%:  think that could be our answer!!
2.52%:  just figured out that black
2.53%:  just figured out that black hole
2.52%:  could write a science book about that one
8.05%:  could write a science book about that one!!
2.51%:  just figured out a better
6.90%:  just figured out a better theory
2.51%:  just figured out another way to be
2.51%:  hate to tell you this but science

1.05%:  feel like science just won the lot
1.05%:  need to go back to the library for a
1.05%:  should write a book about science but only the
1.05%:  can totally see where
1.05%:  just figured out what to talk
1.05%:  really just wrote that for
1.05%:  reject that theory for two
1.05%:  need to go back to where
1.05%:  forget
1.77%:  forget what
1.05%:  just got really into science for about
1.82%:  just got really into science for about three
1.05%:  forgot to say that dark
1.05%:  need to go to the science library for the
1.05%:  think you just went too
1.36%:  think you just went too far!!

1.04%:  still
1.04%:  could totally be wrong about these other
1.04%:  need to talk to you for longer

1.04%:  just thought of one better
1.04%:  was totally right the
1.04%:  really like that!!
1.04%:  could be wrong about all this but that
1.04%:  need to think of a better
1.04%:  just had one of the cool
1.04%:  think we just created science for real!!
1.04%:  think you just created both

1.04%:  need to figure out a way to tell
1.04%:  just thought of a way to end science
1.04%:  just thought of a way to end all science once
1.04%:  could be wrong about all of those
1.04%:  should write a book about all of the science
1.04%:  really just figured out that science
1.04%:  forgot to think about all the ways science
1.04%:  forgot to tell you about black
1.04%:  forgot about the black hole in
1.04%:  could be totally wrong about the first
1.04%:  could be wrong about all of the science here but
1.04%:  would totally be into
1.50%:  would totally be into that!!
1.04%:  thought you worked for science not
1.03%:  totally should write a science book that
1.03%:  should go write
20.26%:  should go write a book about that!!

1.03%:  totally just won the debate
1.03%:  think we just found the root
1.03%:  just figured out black
1.03%:  should totally write a book for the science ner
1.03%:  could totally see that!!
1.03%:  could totally be wrong about the science on
1.04%:  could totally be wrong about the science on this!!
1.03%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but at
1.03%:  just blew your science right outta the freak
1.03%:  think that could be a real
1.03%:  need to talk to the other science
1.03%:  just got a science theory
1.03%:  thought we could talk about it
1.03%:  could be talking to a science
1.03%:  just found out there are other
1.03%:  think you just wrote a better blog
1.03%:  forgot about the black holes in
1.03%:  thought you were into science before
1.03%:  would argue that the science
1.03%:  was totally forget
1.03%:  could write a science book just about that one

1.02%:  just got ch
1.02%:  think you are the
1.02%:  just got a new theory for science and
1.02%:  could be wrong about all of science but that theory
1.02%:  think we just found the great

1.02%:  could be totally wrong about fake
1.02%:  think you just won a free
1.02%:  think you should go tell

0.90%:  would like to note that just
0.90%:  knew you
0.90%:  think you just created a whole science for
0.90%:  think you just blew the fr
0.90%:  totally just won the science debate club
0.90%:  need to figure out how to crash science
0.90%:  think we all just found a theory
0.90%:  just blew your science out
0.90%:  could be wrong about that too!!
0.90%:  think we all just learned about the science
0.90%:  thought it was all
0.90%:  think science just got all the way real!!
0.90%:  just thought of a science book to
19.78%:  just thought of a science book to write called
1.29%:  just thought of a science book to write and
0.90%:  could be right about the fake
0.90%:  always figured that
0.90%:  just thought of a new doctor
0.90%:  should be talking
5.02%:  should be talking about
2.96%:  should be talking about science
2.43%:  should be talking to you
4.60%:  should be talking to you about
2.24%:  should be talking about that
1.64%:  should be talking to you about science
1.31%:  should be talking about science but
1.04%:  should be talking about how
0.90%:  just thought of a totally new dark
0.90%:  just figured out how both
2.01%:  just figured out how both science
0.90%:  always forget about the other
0.89%:  just thought about it really
0.89%:  just forgot about the
0.89%:  would call that a
0.89%:  need to figure out how to buy that
0.89%:  kinda forgot about science
0.89%:  hate to break it to you but all
1.33%:  hate to break it to you but all science
0.89%:  need to get to work on this theory
0.89%:  just totally forgot dark
0.89%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole to outer
0.89%:  would argue that is the
0.89%:  think science just got way cooler and
0.89%:  should really take
0.89%:  think you just wrote science factual
0.89%:  think you just won the battle
4.09%:  think you just won the battle of science

0.89%:  just don
0.89%:  think we found our secret
1.02%:  think we found our secret to
0.89%:  just figured out the cool
0.89%:  just noticed how
0.89%:  just got science hard on
0.89%:  just got yelled
2.20%:  just got yelled at for
2.21%:  just got yelled at for science
0.89%:  thought you were a science bro too
0.89%:  think you just won the science card
0.89%:  could totally be wrong about that one
0.89%:  feel like you just changed science to
0.89%:  thought you were all about science not
0.89%:  could totally write a book for that
0.97%:  could totally write a book for that!!
0.89%:  need to get out of the
0.91%:  need to get out of the science

0.89%:  thought you were closer
0.93%:  thought you were closer to science
0.89%:  would like to be clear that you
4.21%:  would like to be clear that you just
0.89%:  think we all just learned science for
0.89%:  just thought of a way to be an
0.89%:  feel like science just went through a door lab
0.89%:  need to figure out what you
0.89%:  feel like science just threw
0.89%:  could be wrong about totally
0.89%:  need to talk to all the other science bro

0.89%:  thought you were done!!
0.89%:  think you just blew all our fr
0.89%:  think you just science fact
0.89%:  just got a science boner there
0.89%:  could be talking to another
0.89%:  think science just got real for the
0.89%:  just got a little
0.89%:  just thought of a way to cure all
0.89%:  just got totally owned!!
0.89%:  could be right about that!!
0.89%:  just thought of a way to kill science once
0.89%:  really need to brush
0.89%:  just got an idea for the new
0.89%:  could totally be wrong about other
0.89%:  like how you just turned that
0.88%:  can totally write science
0.88%:  thought you liked science too
0.88%:  could totally write a best
0.88%:  should write a book on all

0.88%:  just called you out for being a science bro who
0.88%:  think we just got to
0.88%:  totally forgot we had science
0.88%:  found
0.95%:  found the
0.88%:  just thought of a way to be real
0.88%:  think we should totally go out for
0.88%:  could write a book about the truth
0.88%:  should totally be working on a
2.59%:  should totally be working on a science
0.88%:  just got a new theory and
0.88%:  forgot about the entire dark
0.88%:  could totally be wrong about the science in
0.88%:  just went through science
0.88%:  forgot to include all the ways science
0.88%:  think you just rewrote our science
0.88%:  could be wrong about all the science this
0.88%:  just blew all your science right outta the freak
0.88%:  should write about that for
3.97%:  should write about that for science
1.03%:  should write about that for science blog
0.88%:  need to go to the library to learn about science
3.02%:  need to go to the library to learn about science!!

0.88%:  just got burned
4.69%:  just got burned by science
1.71%:  just got burned by science!!
0.88%:  hate to be wrong but that
0.88%:  forgot about all that other junk science we
0.88%:  could be wrong about the science but those
0.88%:  figured that out all
0.88%:  clearly
2.90%:  clearly need to work

0.87%:  need to figure out how to react
0.87%:  could be wrong about this for only
0.87%:  think you just won the science race for real
0.87%:  just figured out what that science
0.87%:  feel like science has
0.87%:  could write a book about the science of the
0.87%:  just talked about science with another guy for
0.87%:  would like to eat
0.87%:  think they just got
0.87%:  need to talk to you!!
0.87%:  need to look into that
2.23%:  need to look into that!!

0.87%:  just had the science
0.87%:  could be wrong about the history
45.07%:  could be wrong about the history of science!!
19.24%:  could be wrong about the history of science but
0.87%:  would like to just
0.87%:  just broke through science to reality
0.92%:  just broke through science to reality and
0.87%:  really should know better than to get science
0.87%:  would like to see a
0.87%:  think you just lowered
2.64%:  think you just lowered the bar
21.59%:  think you just lowered the bar for science
6.97%:  think you just lowered the bar for science to

0.91%:  think you just lowered the bar for science to be
0.87%:  would just
5.64%:  would just like to note
4.02%:  would just like to note that science
2.92%:  would just like to note that for
2.45%:  would just like to clar
2.26%:  would just like to note that you

1.44%:  would just like to note that for once
1.35%:  would just like to note that before
1.31%:  would just like to be clear that science
1.09%:  would just like to note that your
1.03%:  would just like to be clear about
0.96%:  would just like to be clear that your
0.87%:  really need to figure out how to talk science to
0.87%:  think you just found a science career that
0.87%:  could totally write science books!!
0.87%:  could be wrong about this theory for
0.87%:  just talked about science for two
0.87%:  feel like you just changed how
2.27%:  feel like you just changed how science
0.87%:  would argue that if
0.87%:  thought for certain you would be able
0.87%:  could be wrong about all of science then
0.87%:  hate to be the one to bust your world
0.87%:  feel like we just had
0.87%:  just blew all your science right out the back!!
0.87%:  think you just created science bro
0.87%:  was looking for a better
0.97%:  was looking for a better theory
0.87%:  think science just got cool for
0.87%:  think you just beat the science out
0.87%:  refuse to think about how long
0.87%:  forgot all about how
1.09%:  forgot all about how dark
0.87%:  think you just got all the science out
0.87%:  just talked about science for longer than the
0.87%:  could be totally wrong about the science here so
0.87%:  think you just changed real science fore
0.87%:  think you just blew science out of both
0.87%:  thought you were a fake
0.87%:  totally just figured out how to be real science
0.87%:  clearly need to work for
0.87%:  totally just figured out the one
0.87%:  knew that
0.87%:  would like to buy that science
0.87%:  could be wrong about all these fake bro
0.87%:  like to call
0.87%:  would like to be the one to say
0.86%:  can totally see through
0.86%:  just figured out that all black
0.86%:  need to think about the science
0.86%:  really ought
2.15%:  really ought to write
2.22%:  really ought to write that book
1.57%:  really ought to write science
0.88%:  really ought to write science books
0.86%:  should totally write that science book for
0.86%:  get
0.86%:  think you just earned the cool
0.86%:  could write a science book just for you
0.86%:  think the science world just got about
0.86%:  sure would
2.42%:  sure would like to be
1.42%:  sure would like to be the
1.31%:  sure would like to hear
1.33%:  sure would like to hear that

0.96%:  sure would like to be the guy
0.86%:  forgot you could just
0.86%:  hate to be that guy but dark
0.86%:  could be talking about science for real
0.86%:  just heard science
0.87%:  just heard science talking
5.51%:  just heard science talking about
0.86%:  forgot that there was
0.86%:  totally just won the science fight
0.86%:  really need to figure out who that
0.86%:  think you just won science bro of
0.86%:  really need to go back to just
0.86%:  thought you were a science bro for
4.03%:  thought you were a science bro for a second!!
1.01%:  thought you were a science bro for a second but
0.86%:  need to go write a book!!
0.86%:  should write that out

0.86%:  think you just won the debate of science!!
0.86%:  think you just brought science to new
0.86%:  forgot about the last
0.86%:  need to talk to the science bro
0.86%:  could totally use
1.84%:  could totally use that for
1.22%:  could totally use that for a science
0.86%:  think you just burned science
0.86%:  need to work on science
0.86%:  totally just figured out how to be science bro
0.86%:  just got a new science theory for the
0.86%:  just called you out for not being able to hear
0.86%:  just thought of a better way science could look
0.86%:  could totally be right about another
1.09%:  could totally be right about another science
0.86%:  figured that out just by
0.86%:  think you just won the science debate tro
0.86%:  think you are on
0.86%:  totally just broke through science and into
0.86%:  need to talk to all the science guys about how
0.86%:  totally forgot we could use
1.50%:  totally forgot we could use science
0.86%:  just got really worried
1.29%:  just got really worried about
1.36%:  just got really worried about the
0.86%:  totally should write a science book before
0.86%:  could be wrong about all of the science but there
0.86%:  could totally be on the
2.59%:  could totally be on the right
0.86%:  could totally use that for science
0.86%:  think you just got all of the science!!

0.85%:  just figured out how to totally re
0.85%:  like the sound of the
0.85%:  totally just figured out a whole
0.85%:  would like to be a fly on that science
0.85%:  just figured out how to attack science
0.85%:  need to go to the science library to learn
0.85%:  should write a book about all the energy
0.85%:  should write a book about theory
0.85%:  think you should go for
0.85%:  just fell through
0.85%:  really just wanted to look at the
0.85%:  really like the sound of that one
3.61%:  really like the sound of that one!!
0.85%:  just blew your dark
0.85%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to science theory
0.85%:  just figured out how to not care
0.85%:  totally just thought of a career
0.85%:  just totally figured out how to science
0.85%:  think we found the real science
0.85%:  can totally see that working for science bro
0.85%:  forgot to tell you that science
0.85%:  forgot this
0.85%:  could totally be right about science for
0.85%:  should write a science book for other
0.85%:  think you just found all the science to
0.85%:  think we should totally go to
0.85%:  just got an idea for a whole
0.85%:  need to think about that because
0.85%:  really need to talk to science about how
0.85%:  think you just brought science down for

1.40%:  think you just got on the science
0.85%:  really just wanted to fight
3.30%:  really just wanted to fight about
0.85%:  really should write that science
2.09%:  really should write that science book
1.06%:  really should write that science book after
0.85%:  just figured out where all the cool science bab
0.85%:  totally just heard science talking
0.85%:  wonder if they
0.85%:  choose
1.58%:  choose to ignore
0.85%:  think that could totally
0.85%:  think science just got another
0.85%:  totally should write a book for science
1.29%:  totally should write a book for science ner
0.85%:  think you just rewrote the nature of all
1.47%:  think you just rewrote the nature of all science
0.87%:  think you just rewrote the nature of all science!!
0.85%:  refuse to be wrong about science
0.85%:  just got turned onto
0.90%:  just got turned onto science
0.85%:  need to call science right now to
0.85%:  just figured out whether or not science can
0.85%:  just figured out how to take the science
0.84%:  think you just blew science to
0.84%:  could be wrong about the rest of nature
0.84%:  need to talk to this science
1.35%:  need to talk to this science guy!!

0.84%:  just called you out for knowing
0.84%:  regret
0.84%:  totally just figured out what non
0.84%:  could be right about the rest
0.84%:  just wrote a science book for little
0.84%:  would just like to be clear that the science
0.84%:  think science just got all the way cool!!
0.84%:  would like to see that science fact
0.84%:  just thought of a radical
2.56%:  just thought of a radical new science
0.84%:  will take that theory and
0.84%:  forgot the whole
0.84%:  forgot you were the science
0.84%:  thought you were for certain
0.84%:  just created a new science theory right
0.84%:  think you just got a science doctor
0.84%:  really should go
1.56%:  really should go back
2.52%:  really should go back to science
1.38%:  really should go to the science
2.05%:  really should go to the science centre
1.18%:  really should go to the science center
0.99%:  really should go back to science before
0.90%:  really should go back to the
0.88%:  really should go to science
1.02%:  really should go to science con
0.84%:  like the sound of you better
0.84%:  should write a book about science or
0.84%:  really should get back into science for
0.84%:  just thought of a way it
3.77%:  just thought of a way it could be science
1.47%:  just thought of a way it could be science!!
0.84%:  think you just created a whole science of
0.84%:  clearly need to write a science book to
0.84%:  hate to be wrong about science
0.93%:  hate to be wrong about science but
0.84%:  think science just got way cooler for about
1.75%:  think science just got way cooler for about three
0.84%:  could totally see that being how
0.84%:  need to write a science book real fast
5.65%:  need to write a science book real fast!!
0.84%:  need to work for the science section
0.84%:  just blew your little
1.40%:  just blew your little science
0.84%:  think you just changed science but
0.84%:  could be totally wrong about this but science
0.84%:  just won the science lottery of
0.84%:  just found the lo
0.84%:  think you just changed all of our science!!
0.84%:  just got a new science theory that
0.84%:  thought for certain you were on
0.84%:  should write a book about science truth
0.84%:  forgot about all that other science junk
0.84%:  just got a new idea
6.07%:  just got a new idea for science

1.13%:  think the answer to your
0.84%:  would like to be that guy!!
0.84%:  just got yelled at for not
0.84%:  just got called out by a science writer
0.84%:  just won the science battle of
0.99%:  just won the science battle of our

0.84%:  would still argue that the
0.84%:  think you just fl
0.84%:  just thought of a way science could let
0.84%:  really should get a
0.84%:  thought you liked science fact
0.84%:  already thought about it
0.84%:  just thought of a way to do
2.54%:  just thought of a way to do science
0.84%:  should write a science book on the
0.84%:  really just wrote that out loud!!
0.84%:  would argue that the only
0.84%:  need to go to science
1.29%:  need to go to science school
0.97%:  need to go to science school!!
0.84%:  need to figure out what science books

0.84%:  just looked into your
0.84%:  feel like that should be science
0.84%:  forgot about that second
0.87%:  forgot about that second theory
0.84%:  forgot to rule out science
0.83%:  totally forgot about the science club
0.83%:  totally forgot there was other
1.21%:  totally forgot there was other science
0.83%:  think science just totally blew
0.83%:  should totally get a science book written for
0.83%:  totally think that could
0.83%:  think you just rewrote all of the science about
0.83%:  could be wrong about the nature of science!!
0.83%:  think you found our
0.83%:  really think we should go for
0.83%:  think science just got really cool there
0.83%:  could be wrong about another theory
0.83%:  think you just brought science down for all
0.83%:  thought you were a real doctor!!
0.83%:  would totally not be
0.83%:  like the cut
0.83%:  really think we should forget
5.45%:  really think we should forget about
2.77%:  really think we should forget about science
0.83%:  think we just found our theory to
0.83%:  just caught
0.83%:  could be wrong on
0.83%:  should totally be an
0.83%:  could be wrong about all those other science
0.83%:  think you just grabbed the crown
3.49%:  think you just grabbed the crown of science
0.83%:  just got an idea for a rock
0.83%:  could be talking about science now
0.83%:  could be wrong about the last one but
0.83%:  thought it could
0.96%:  thought it could only
0.83%:  should write a science book about the only
0.83%:  just blew their
0.83%:  think science just found out how to be really great
0.83%:  just got cold
0.83%:  just found a way

0.83%:  need to figure out how to ask
0.83%:  need to go to the library to learn how
0.83%:  need to buy
0.83%:  just won the science debate for real
0.83%:  forgot that science was
0.83%:  would totally agree that

0.83%:  totally should write a science book for the
0.83%:  like you better than science!!
0.83%:  really just wanted to argue for
0.83%:  need to get on this!!
0.82%:  already thought about it!!
0.82%:  just created a new theory of both
1.90%:  just created a new theory of both science
0.82%:  hate to burst your science balloon but there
0.82%:  do not know science
0.82%:  refuse to think about the world
0.82%:  need to get on that science
0.82%:  should write a book about only the
0.82%:  know this
0.82%:  forgot about the only
0.82%:  totally just ruined science for both
0.82%:  thought it would
0.82%:  thought you were a science doctor
0.82%:  think you just forced science to re

0.82%:  hate it when you do science
0.82%:  think you just rewrote all of science to be a
0.82%:  feel like you should get
0.82%:  just talked about science for a
4.47%:  just talked about science for a whole

1.05%:  just talked about science for a while
0.82%:  could totally be right here
0.82%:  just got turned on to the
0.82%:  should write fan
0.82%:  totally forgot to talk
0.82%:  should get back to science
0.82%:  would like to note that you are
0.82%:  thought you were f
0.82%:  need to get back to science sooner
0.82%:  totally forgot to answer
0.82%:  just figured out a way science
0.82%:  really need to think about that for science
0.82%:  think we just created a theory of science to
0.82%:  think you just rewrote the science of an
0.82%:  could be wrong about all that but
0.82%:  would like that story to be real
0.82%:  just thought of a new diet
0.82%:  need to go to the science library real
0.82%:  could totally be right about one or
0.82%:  really need to figure out how to stalk
0.82%:  just got called out for science by the
0.82%:  just got an idea for a better science book
2.26%:  just got an idea for a better science book!!
0.82%:  really think we should get out of our
0.82%:  just thought of a new and better book
0.82%:  would just like to be the
0.82%:  could be talking about science but then
0.82%:  hate that

1.00%:  hate that you know about
0.82%:  think we just found the core
0.82%:  feel like that would change
1.25%:  feel like that would change science
0.82%:  just thought of an actual
1.74%:  just thought of an actual science
0.82%:  think science just got way cooler all
1.71%:  think science just got way cooler all of the
0.82%:  just killed the science of
0.82%:  should write a science book to counter all
1.07%:  should write a science book to counter all the
0.82%:  take that
0.82%:  want to be friends
0.82%:  would bet
0.82%:  would like that science to be true so
0.81%:  thought you looked nice
0.81%:  think we just found true
1.36%:  think we just found true science
0.81%:  really need to work for
0.81%:  totally forgot that could
0.99%:  totally forgot that could be science
0.81%:  think you just won the science fact debate
0.81%:  could write that on
0.81%:  thought you were friends!!
0.81%:  could totally be right about other
0.81%:  need to figure out how to learn
1.48%:  need to figure out how to learn science
0.81%:  just thought of your entire

1.73%:  just figured out how to tell the real science
0.81%:  just thought of a brand new science career to
0.81%:  totally just figured out the core science
0.81%:  think you just won the science board
0.81%:  totally forgot the dark
0.81%:  just created a whole

0.99%:  think science just won the debate about
0.86%:  think science just won the debate for
0.81%:  just thought about all
0.81%:  just thought of a way science could be neat
0.81%:  could be wrong about this then
0.81%:  could be wrong here but that
0.81%:  need to figure out how to sell that science
0.81%:  think you just tr
0.81%:  want to go back to
0.81%:  really need to figure out what counts
0.81%:  thought you were real science!!
0.81%:  reject this theory out of science
0.81%:  just got a really cool idea!!
0.81%:  should write a book on science fact
0.81%:  should write a book but call
0.81%:  like how you just changed
0.81%:  just thought of a totally rad
1.62%:  just thought of a totally rad science
1.29%:  just thought of a totally rad new

0.81%:  will look
0.81%:  thought you cared about real science not
0.81%:  feel like that just brought
1.14%:  feel like that just brought science
0.81%:  should write a book about current
7.89%:  should write a book about current science
1.45%:  should write a book about current science that
0.81%:  thought you cared about science now!!
0.81%:  refuse to allow science to be
0.81%:  totally just broke the science world
0.81%:  just got called out by a science bro who
0.81%:  was right!!
0.81%:  need to go to the science store!!
0.81%:  could be wrong about all of science but there
0.81%:  really think we just found out the real
0.81%:  already know about this
0.81%:  need to figure out how to break that
0.80%:  think that just got science
0.80%:  think you just altered the science of our
0.80%:  feel like you just beat
0.80%:  think we just found a theory to
0.80%:  just got turned on by science talk for
0.80%:  really need to figure out how to crash
1.24%:  really need to figure out how to crash science
0.80%:  think you just got burned
0.80%:  would be the first to call you on that
0.80%:  think you just created a science bro
0.80%:  forgot all about the current
0.80%:  need to write a book full
0.80%:  could be wrong about the science but at least for
0.80%:  would totally go out
0.80%:  just figured out that what
0.80%:  think you just lowered the bar for science a
0.80%:  just thought of a brand new book to

0.80%:  clearly need to know
0.80%:  think we just got one
0.80%:  forgot that the
0.80%:  think you just blew science a
0.80%:  just got turned on by the science of
0.80%:  need to think about the science for

0.80%:  just won the science fight
0.80%:  thought you were on science
1.48%:  thought you were on science break
1.26%:  thought you were on science break!!
0.80%:  just figured out where that black
0.80%:  really want to be
1.29%:  really want to be right
1.07%:  really want to be right about the
0.80%:  feel really
0.80%:  could write a book on that one
0.80%:  think you just touched a
0.80%:  need to figure out how to talk to science
0.80%:  think you just brought all of science to new
0.80%:  think you just got science harder!!
0.80%:  wrote that book because
0.80%:  think we should all be
0.80%:  should write a book about there
0.80%:  forgot to say there
0.80%:  just broke the theory
1.32%:  just broke the theory of rel
0.80%:  think we should all get out
2.73%:  think we should all get out of science
2.30%:  think we should all get out our
1.11%:  think we should all get out our science
0.80%:  could write a book about science just
0.80%:  think you just wrote a better science blog
0.80%:  should write a letter to science fact
0.80%:  think you just wrote that for
0.80%:  need to go think about how science
0.80%:  really should get a science
0.80%:  should get back to you when
0.80%:  thought science was finally
0.80%:  think you just got a hole
1.62%:  think you just got a hole card
0.80%:  was about to call the
0.80%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science but not
0.80%:  think that could be our new science for
0.80%:  forgot to tell you the answer could
0.80%:  thought you were an actual science bro
0.80%:  really ought to be
0.80%:  think science just blew our

1.16%:  hate to burst your balloon of science here but
0.80%:  feel like you just won that
0.80%:  forgot that we
0.80%:  just thought of a brand new science book to buy
0.79%:  could be wrong after
0.79%:  just had a science org
0.79%:  feel like you just argued
0.79%:  forgot the answer to that!!
0.79%:  just figured out the holy
0.79%:  just thought of a way to build an
0.79%:  need to talk to this guy about how science
0.79%:  really should get back to science then
0.79%:  need to get back to this
0.83%:  need to get back to this theory
0.79%:  forgot about all the other ways science
2.32%:  forgot about all the other ways science could
0.79%:  just figured out the science to why
0.79%:  really just want to be right for
2.42%:  really just want to be right for once!!
0.84%:  really just want to be right for once about
0.79%:  need to talk to you about science later
1.80%:  need to talk to you about science later!!
0.79%:  just figured out what science theory
0.79%:  should be the one to write
5.20%:  should be the one to write science
0.79%:  think you just learned how
2.36%:  think you just learned how science
2.04%:  think you just learned how to science
1.46%:  think you just learned how to be
1.02%:  think you just learned how to argue
0.79%:  need to look further
0.79%:  forgot to rule that out because dark
0.79%:  could go for that!!
0.79%:  need to talk about this on
0.79%:  forgot that science could be real
0.79%:  can barely follow

0.79%:  would be totally into
0.90%:  would be totally into that!!
0.79%:  will not be outdone by
0.79%:  could be wrong about all the science this one
0.79%:  would like that to be canon
0.79%:  forgot about all this other junk we
0.79%:  should totally write a fake
5.20%:  should totally write a fake science
0.79%:  would argue that these
0.79%:  just won the science battle round
0.79%:  just thought of one!!
0.79%:  think you need to call the
2.08%:  think you need to call the science
0.79%:  could write a science book just for the
0.79%:  could be wrong about all the science but there is
0.79%:  think science just got really real for about
0.79%:  was born
0.90%:  was born today
0.79%:  forgot you were a science student
0.94%:  forgot you were a science student!!

0.79%:  forgot you were an
0.79%:  think you found the source
0.79%:  could totally write a book for science
1.80%:  could totally write a book for science ner
0.79%:  would totally go there!!
0.79%:  think you just got called out for science her
0.79%:  think we just agreed
0.82%:  think we just agreed to
0.79%:  could be wrong about that last theory
0.79%:  think you just wrote a doctor
0.79%:  could be wrong about these totally
0.79%:  just got an idea for another theory
1.30%:  just got an idea for another theory!!
0.79%:  clearly need to talk about
0.79%:  would still argue they are
1.25%:  would still argue they are fake!!
0.79%:  thought you were into science facts!!
0.79%:  really need to talk to the science bro
1.83%:  really need to talk to the science bros about
0.79%:  think we found out about the secret
0.79%:  need to go to the library to learn what
0.79%:  think we just out
0.79%:  clearly need to go to
0.84%:  clearly need to go to science
0.79%:  really thought it would be just
0.79%:  totally wrote that before
0.79%:  need to go write that book!!
0.79%:  always liked that
0.79%:  think you just brought science and fr
0.79%:  could be wrong about all of history
0.79%:  can totally work
0.79%:  really need to figure out how to ask
0.79%:  hate to break it to all you science nerds but we
0.79%:  could be wrong about like
0.79%:  just thought of a way to reduce science
0.79%:  need to write a science book for the
0.79%:  would call you
0.79%:  should write a book about science but not
1.08%:  should write a book about science but not really
0.79%:  could be wrong about this theory after
0.79%:  could write that story
0.79%:  can totally go for this
0.79%:  just got a science boner for you
0.79%:  think you just let the
0.79%:  just got called out on science theory
0.79%:  will not be outdone!!

0.78%:  could be wrong about all this but science
0.78%:  thought you were all about dark
0.78%:  really need to figure out how to ban
0.78%:  just talked about science with the
0.78%:  really need to figure out how to count

0.78%:  forgot that there could
0.78%:  can totally write a science book for
0.78%:  just found a way to be right about the

1.66%:  just think of all the science
0.66%:  hate that you just turned
0.66%:  already thought it
0.66%:  really just figured that
0.68%:  really just figured that one
4.10%:  really just figured that one out!!
0.66%:  could be wrong about all of science but that is
0.66%:  knew you could
0.66%:  hate to break it you but
0.66%:  need to go back to the future so
0.66%:  think you just blew all science for the
0.66%:  just thought about it real
0.66%:  hate to break it to all the
1.67%:  hate to break it to all the science
2.11%:  hate to break it to all the science guys
0.92%:  hate to break it to all the science ner
0.69%:  hate to break it to all the science bro
0.66%:  forgot science is
1.02%:  forgot science is allowed
1.13%:  forgot science is allowed to be
0.66%:  could totally be wrong about these!!
0.66%:  could write a book just on
5.25%:  could write a book just on that theory
0.95%:  could write a book just on that!!
0.66%:  just figured out that science really
0.66%:  just got another idea for a science book
3.91%:  just got another idea for a science book!!
0.66%:  forgot you could use
4.51%:  forgot you could use science
0.66%:  really just wanted to get back
0.66%:  just brought
0.66%:  could be wrong about the first three but
0.66%:  think we all just got our theory
0.69%:  think we all just got our theory of science
0.66%:  just got a new idea for a science lecture
1.15%:  just got a new idea for a science lecture!!
0.66%:  forgot about the entire subject
0.66%:  refuse to allow science to be brought
0.66%:  should totally write that joke
0.66%:  think you just won the science r
0.66%:  just thought of science and it
0.66%:  just won the science lottery for like a
0.66%:  could be wrong about all those fake
0.65%:  really think that would
0.65%:  feel like you just got the science
0.65%:  think we just found true science!!
0.65%:  just thought of a new book about science
1.12%:  just thought of a new book about science called
0.65%:  totally forgot there could be science
0.65%:  thought you were cool for
0.65%:  feel like you just brought that
0.65%:  think you just rewrote all the science on
0.65%:  really should be better
2.99%:  really should be better at science
0.65%:  clearly need to get out
0.75%:  clearly need to get out of
0.92%:  clearly need to get out of science
0.65%:  could be wrong about the science but the rest
0.65%:  totally should write a book that
0.65%:  think our science just got harder
0.65%:  think you just entered science
0.65%:  could be wrong about the last bit!!
0.65%:  should go write a book!!
0.65%:  would just like to note that for science
0.65%:  thought you liked science but
0.67%:  thought you liked science but now
0.65%:  bet you could write a book that
0.65%:  just thought of a really cool new science to
0.65%:  really should write a book about science but then
0.65%:  should write a science book but not
1.03%:  should write a science book but not really
0.65%:  really need to get to work on science
0.65%:  just took the
0.65%:  just threw out a science
3.71%:  just threw out a science theory
0.97%:  just threw out a science theory for
0.87%:  just threw out a science theory and
0.82%:  just threw out a science theory like
0.80%:  just threw out a science theory!!
0.76%:  just threw out a science fact
0.65%:  clearly need to write that
3.96%:  clearly need to write that book
1.66%:  clearly need to write that book!!
0.65%:  better call
0.65%:  should tell you that
0.65%:  really thought for certain
0.65%:  just figured out how to be science bro
0.65%:  think you just fell down a science hole!!
0.65%:  just bought
1.38%:  just bought a ticket
1.14%:  just bought a ticket to science
0.65%:  would totally be the
0.87%:  would totally be the first one
0.74%:  would totally be the first science
0.65%:  think you better go
0.65%:  just got hit by a nuclear
0.75%:  just got hit by a nuclear science
0.65%:  could be wrong about all this you
0.65%:  just wrote a science theory
0.65%:  think they call
0.65%:  thought for certain nobody
0.65%:  just got hit by a double wh
0.65%:  need to talk to science right now because
0.65%:  clearly need to work for science
0.65%:  think you just forgot to tell
0.65%:  just won the science battle for
0.65%:  think you just called our
0.65%:  reject that theory out of science
0.65%:  just figured out how to both be
0.65%:  do not know about science but this
0.65%:  could totally be a science author
0.65%:  could totally be a science author!!
0.65%:  could totally go for that answer
0.65%:  refuse to allow that theory
0.65%:  could be wrong about this after all you
0.65%:  reject that out of hand but
0.65%:  could be totally right about one
0.65%:  really should get back to science after
0.65%:  just got all the credit
1.09%:  just got all the credit for science
0.66%:  just got all the credit for the
0.65%:  just totally figured out how to be a science hero
0.65%:  just got a science boner for dark
0.65%:  just got called out by a fr
0.65%:  was talking to the
0.65%:  should be talking about the
0.93%:  should be talking about the science
0.65%:  totally forgot there was a bunch
0.65%:  was born today!!
0.65%:  think science just got really cool and
0.65%:  just figured out that science can be really
0.65%:  need to go think about the science
0.65%:  think you just blew science out of the eternal
0.65%:  can totally see that working for other
0.65%:  totally just thought of new science career!!
0.65%:  refuse to allow science to get
0.65%:  just went through an
0.65%:  need to think for
0.65%:  really just thought about science for once
0.65%:  could totally be right but
0.65%:  just talked about science for longer than two
0.65%:  just figured out real
4.95%:  just figured out real science
3.52%:  just figured out real science!!
0.65%:  think you just brought an
0.65%:  thought you were a doctor!!
0.65%:  think we found out about science
0.65%:  just told
1.88%:  just told you that
0.94%:  just told you about
0.93%:  just told you there
0.83%:  just told you there are
0.65%:  called
0.65%:  could totally be wrong about the science of these
0.65%:  really just figured out science!!
0.65%:  really thought we talked
5.20%:  really thought we talked about science
1.68%:  really thought we talked about science for
2.53%:  really thought we talked about science for once

18.71%:  think you just rewrote the balance of science
5.99%:  think you just rewrote the balance of science!!
2.00%:  think you just rewrote the balance of science to
0.65%:  think we just un
0.65%:  just got a really cool idea for the science
0.65%:  just blew all our science out of the air
0.65%:  just figured out the science on

0.65%:  think you just created two science
0.65%:  should write a science book but not before
0.64%:  could write science books for
0.70%:  could write science books for the
0.64%:  just thought you
0.65%:  just thought you were a
1.07%:  just thought you were a friend
0.74%:  just thought you were a friend!!
0.64%:  really think we should go to outer
0.64%:  could get into that theory!!
0.64%:  do not know about this guy but
0.64%:  think you just won the science bro debate!!
0.64%:  totally should be working for science
0.64%:  like you but
0.64%:  feel like that theory just got blown
0.64%:  forgot about the entire science world
0.64%:  just thought of a new science to create
1.11%:  just thought of a new science to create!!
0.64%:  just threw out a science theory about
0.64%:  could totally be right about freak
0.64%:  really need to figure out how to attack
0.64%:  think you just brought one of science
0.64%:  forgot that science works

0.64%:  should write about that one
0.64%:  think we just created a theory about
0.64%:  kinda thought you
2.34%:  kinda thought you were just
0.64%:  really need to get back into science just
0.88%:  really need to get back into science just for
0.64%:  just had like

0.57%:  thought you were just a cool
3.16%:  thought you were just a cool friend
1.43%:  thought you were just a cool friend!!
0.57%:  just thought of a new robot
0.57%:  totally figured out where
0.57%:  could totally be right about where
0.57%:  can totally get behind the
0.57%:  just got really worried that science
0.57%:  would like to note for the court
0.57%:  should totally work on a
1.92%:  should totally work on a science
0.57%:  really think we just found the true
0.57%:  think you just learned science for
0.57%:  could be wrong about tons
1.61%:  could be wrong about tons of science
0.89%:  could be wrong about tons of science!!
0.57%:  thought you were all just fake
0.57%:  could be wrong about one of the tr
0.57%:  need to figure out how to not
0.57%:  just got better
11.33%:  just got better at science
6.80%:  just got better at science!!
1.18%:  just got better at science and
0.75%:  just got better at science for
0.91%:  just got better at science for real
0.72%:  just got better at science and you
0.70%:  just got better at science while
1.07%:  just got better at science while you
0.57%:  think you just blew science out of all the
0.57%:  really should write about
0.57%:  think you just flew
0.56%:  should totally write to science
0.56%:  could totally be wrong on this!!
0.56%:  just got all the way out of science
0.56%:  need to think about science
1.07%:  need to think about science for
0.56%:  totally just found out how science
0.56%:  just got the idea for a really
0.56%:  need to get back into science for sure
0.56%:  figured out the answer to science!!
0.56%:  could be talking about science the
0.70%:  could be talking about science the whole rest
0.56%:  just got a really cool new
2.35%:  just got a really cool new idea for science
3.93%:  just got a really cool new idea for science!!
0.56%:  just got a really cool new science
0.84%:  just got a really cool new science idea!!
0.56%:  was trying
0.56%:  thought you were fake bros!!
0.56%:  think the science world just got a lot cool
0.56%:  really think that would be too
0.56%:  just figured out a really
0.56%:  could be wrong about the science here but if
0.56%:  totally just figured out whether black
0.56%:  just thought of a nick
0.56%:  totally forgot the answer
1.14%:  totally forgot the answer could
0.62%:  totally forgot the answer could be science
0.56%:  just got turned on by science without
0.56%:  need to go think about that because
0.56%:  just talked about science for the whole article!!
0.56%:  just figured out what real science really
0.56%:  totally just won the science for
0.56%:  really just thought of it!!
0.56%:  thought you liked science too!!
0.56%:  think you just won science all
0.61%:  think you just won science all the gold
0.56%:  forgot about the other kind
0.56%:  could be wrong about all the science on
0.56%:  need to figure out how to suck
0.56%:  refuse to be wrong about the science
0.56%:  would totally go for this!!
0.56%:  totally forgot that science could answer
0.56%:  should totally go on
0.56%:  think you just won the science fact debate!!
0.56%:  think we found out the secret about
0.56%:  would like that to be true for no
1.29%:  would like that to be true for no other
0.56%:  hate to be the one to burst your f
0.56%:  need to get a
0.60%:  need to get a job
0.56%:  just got a new science friend
0.56%:  just called you a fake bro without
0.56%:  thought about you last
0.56%:  just forgot how to be
1.02%:  just forgot how to be certain
0.56%:  could be right about the non
0.56%:  could be wrong about one of the least
0.56%:  think you just beat the record
0.56%:  hate you for knowing all
1.16%:  hate you for knowing all these
1.06%:  hate you for knowing all these science
0.62%:  hate you for knowing all the
5.01%:  hate you for knowing all the science
1.37%:  hate you for knowing all the science but
1.30%:  hate you for knowing all the science better
1.25%:  hate you for knowing all the science about
0.96%:  hate you for knowing all the science!!
0.56%:  just got totally blown
0.56%:  need to borrow your light
0.56%:  just blew your entire science out of the dark
0.56%:  just got a whole bunch of science better
0.56%:  really think we should get our
1.97%:  really think we should get our science
0.65%:  really think we should get our science fact
0.56%:  really need to get back on science
0.56%:  think we could totally
0.56%:  could be wrong about this too
0.56%:  should get back to you about that one!!
0.56%:  declare
0.56%:  just thought of a really weird science book
0.56%:  just found out that all
0.56%:  should write a science book about the non
0.56%:  totally just broke science with a
0.56%:  need to go talk to science
0.56%:  should go write about
0.87%:  should go write about that!!
0.56%:  think today
0.56%:  looked that
0.56%:  hate to be that guy but bro
0.56%:  just blew all your science out the back of the boat
0.56%:  totally forgot about the real science
0.56%:  just heard science talk
1.58%:  just heard science talk about
0.56%:  need to tell you about science
0.56%:  just figured out both why
0.56%:  would still argue they are fake but
0.56%:  think science just got real for real
0.56%:  need to figure out how to science all
0.56%:  think you just grabbed the science ball
0.56%:  could be wrong about solar
0.56%:  just walked
1.71%:  just walked into the
1.12%:  just walked into your
1.05%:  just walked right
1.01%:  just walked into your thought
0.83%:  just walked into the future
0.79%:  just walked into the future!!
0.59%:  just walked into a science
2.79%:  just walked into a science lecture
1.02%:  just walked into a science lecture!!
0.56%:  could be wrong about all the science before this!!
0.56%:  wonder if there are
0.56%:  kinda want to go
0.56%:  totally just figured out where the cool
0.56%:  could be wrong about a lot of science here
0.80%:  could be wrong about a lot of science here!!
0.56%:  should write a book about that energy
0.56%:  thought you were for science and
0.72%:  thought you were for science and not
0.56%:  would totally go back to the
2.83%:  would totally go back to the future
0.56%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science but at
0.56%:  thought you were dark
0.56%:  just thought of a new science book you
0.56%:  just totally forgot about how
0.56%:  just got science harder
0.56%:  think you just rewrote all of science on
0.56%:  think science just found the cool
0.56%:  just wrote an entire science blog
0.56%:  could be wrong about all the science on the
0.56%:  just thought of a way to link science to
0.56%:  should write a science book for non
0.56%:  hate to be wrong about this but you
0.56%:  just got a new theory that science
0.56%:  should write a science book to teach
0.56%:  should totally go write that
0.73%:  should totally go write that science
0.56%:  really should be working on science
0.56%:  just had a really cool science
0.56%:  should write a book of science that reject
0.56%:  just blew the science
0.56%:  could use
0.56%:  could use that
0.64%:  could use that theory
0.56%:  think you just blew science out of the d
0.56%:  thought you were a cool
0.75%:  thought you were a cool friend
0.86%:  thought you were a cool friend but
0.56%:  think you just won the science cold
0.56%:  forgot to tell you but
0.56%:  was about to tell you about
0.56%:  would like that to be the subject of an
0.56%:  could totally be working on a
0.65%:  could totally be working on a science
0.56%:  could be wrong about a lot of this science!!
0.56%:  can totally see that working for our
1.57%:  can totally see that working for our science
0.56%:  forgot about all the other weird
0.73%:  forgot about all the other weird science
0.56%:  need to talk with you later
0.69%:  need to talk with you later about
0.56%:  just heard a science
1.23%:  just heard a science theory
0.56%:  really need to work on those
0.56%:  just figured out what one
0.56%:  think we should be
0.57%:  think we should be careful
3.08%:  think we should be careful about
0.97%:  think we should be careful about science
0.56%:  know that theory
0.56%:  really ought to write a
2.52%:  really ought to write a science
3.00%:  really ought to write a science book
0.84%:  really ought to write a book about
0.59%:  really ought to write a science book for
0.69%:  really ought to write a science book for adults
0.56%:  think you just changed science to be all
4.12%:  think you just changed science to be all about
0.56%:  just need to go
0.91%:  just need to go back
1.08%:  just need to go back to the
2.56%:  just need to go back to the library
1.00%:  just need to go back to the future
0.64%:  just need to go back in
0.56%:  refuse to be wrong!!
0.56%:  could be wrong about all these other fant
0.56%:  just figured out what all the science book
0.56%:  feel like science just got real today
1.54%:  feel like science just got real today!!
0.56%:  just thought about a way for
0.56%:  think you should let science
0.56%:  forgot to tell you science
0.56%:  just won the science club
0.56%:  could be wrong about one of these but
0.56%:  think you just bought all
0.56%:  clearly need to start working out
0.56%:  just got a science boner for like
0.55%:  think we just found out a
0.55%:  totally just won science for real
0.55%:  need to talk to you in
0.55%:  think you could just
0.55%:  think we just agreed to call
0.55%:  thought you were science fact
0.55%:  gotta tell you about
0.55%:  just got all the science and
0.55%:  think you just found science!!
0.55%:  thought you were too cute
0.55%:  could be wrong you
0.55%:  forgot to include the last
0.55%:  just got called out for a
0.64%:  just got called out for a science
0.71%:  just got called out for a science theory
0.55%:  just want to be
1.40%:  just want to be clear here
1.07%:  just want to be clear that you
0.84%:  just want to be clear though
0.55%:  think you just turned a science fact
0.55%:  reject that theory for no
0.55%:  just want to be clear before
0.55%:  forgot all about the second
0.55%:  totally wrote a
1.35%:  totally wrote a science
1.37%:  totally wrote a science book
1.05%:  totally wrote a book
0.99%:  totally wrote a science book once
1.56%:  totally wrote a science book once!!
0.55%:  should totally work on that before
0.55%:  clearly need to look further
0.55%:  just blew your science right outta here
0.55%:  should totally go out
0.55%:  hate to break this to you but we all
0.55%:  think you just got all of the science cred
0.55%:  should really get into
3.40%:  should really get into science
0.61%:  should really get into science before
0.55%:  should totally write science fact about
0.55%:  would really rather not be the
0.55%:  feel like science just got a bunch harder
0.55%:  just need to figure out how to breath
0.55%:  forgot about the other answer
0.55%:  just totally figured out another
0.55%:  forgot about all those dark
0.55%:  just wrote a science book and the
0.56%:  just wrote a science book and the only
0.55%:  think you just got a science fact
0.55%:  could be right after
0.55%:  will take that theory for
0.55%:  forgot to count that!!
0.55%:  think you just altered our
0.55%:  just thought of a new colour!!
0.55%:  just totally figured out what real
1.14%:  just totally figured out what real science
0.55%:  just thought of a new book to buy
0.55%:  could be right all the
0.55%:  think we just had science
0.55%:  really should get back into the
2.95%:  really should get back into the science
0.55%:  really like how that
0.55%:  just need to figure out how to break all
0.55%:  think you just won the god
0.55%:  just got all the credit for your
0.55%:  think we just found the real science to
0.55%:  forgot to include an
0.55%:  think you just won science club for
0.55%:  think you just won science bro battle
0.55%:  think we should totally science
0.55%:  just got called out by a science writer!!
0.55%:  forgot to tell you the real answer to
0.55%:  just forgot how to be certain about science
0.55%:  thought you would like
0.55%:  totally forgot about the new
1.17%:  totally forgot about the new science
1.07%:  totally forgot about the new dark
0.55%:  just broke down
3.59%:  just broke down crying
0.96%:  just broke down crying!!
0.55%:  hate you for knowing the
1.14%:  hate you for knowing the science
1.33%:  hate you for knowing the science better
0.55%:  would like for that to be your
0.55%:  could be wrong about anti
0.55%:  think we just found all the science!!
0.55%:  just got turned on by science while
0.55%:  see
0.55%:  see through
1.11%:  see through your trick
0.97%:  see through your science
0.85%:  see through your dark
0.55%:  should write that book but
0.55%:  just figured out how to be a better science bro
1.17%:  just figured out how to be a better science bro!!
0.55%:  think we just found our great science
0.65%:  think we just found our great science theory
0.55%:  think you just cleared that
0.55%:  just got hit by a truck of science and the
0.55%:  would like to go to that science
2.14%:  would like to go to that science lecture
0.93%:  would like to go to that science lecture!!
0.55%:  need to write a science book really
5.06%:  need to write a science book really fast!!
0.55%:  just got turned on by science but
0.55%:  just learned about the science
0.55%:  need to get back into science for sure!!
0.55%:  need to go back to the library for the science
0.55%:  just thought of about a
0.55%:  like that better than your
0.55%:  thought you left because
0.55%:  could totally write that on
0.55%:  just got owned by science bro
0.55%:  could talk about how
0.66%:  could talk about how that

0.61%:  really need to get to work on a science
0.55%:  think you just won the science race for our
0.55%:  could be wrong about all the science but these
0.55%:  figured that one out just by
0.55%:  could be totally right about fake
0.55%:  just blew the theory
0.55%:  just broke science theory with
0.55%:  think we should totally be
0.55%:  would like for that to be the science
0.55%:  refuse to hear
0.55%:  really should write a science book that
0.55%:  need to follow you
0.55%:  thought you cared about science not fake
0.55%:  totally need to figure out who just
0.55%:  really need to figure out how to block sub
0.55%:  could be the first guy to know the real
0.55%:  just got called out in science for
0.55%:  could be totally wrong about this for science
0.55%:  think you just blew all of science on
0.71%:  think you just blew all of science on the
0.55%:  could be wrong on that
0.55%:  just had the c
0.55%:  forgot about this theory but now
0.55%:  forgot about the science theory!!
0.55%:  think you just won the science cred
0.55%:  thought you were real for so
0.55%:  hate to break this to you all but science

0.55%:  totally forgot to think
0.55%:  thought you worked at a science
0.91%:  thought you worked at a science centre
0.55%:  should write a book about the science of energy
0.55%:  should totally write a book for ner
0.55%:  would like that to be the case but science
0.55%:  need to go back to where this
0.55%:  think you just wrote a good
1.77%:  think you just wrote a good science
0.55%:  forgot that you can
0.55%:  think you just bought a science
0.55%:  just got hit by a truck of science and there
0.55%:  just got a new book
1.49%:  just got a new book deal
0.55%:  totally just figured out how to h
0.55%:  really think that could be a
0.55%:  think you just rewrote science for a
0.55%:  really want to go back to the first
0.55%:  should totally write a science book for ch
0.55%:  need to go write that science book
0.55%:  need to know about this theory
0.57%:  need to know about this theory!!
0.55%:  call that one
0.55%:  just walked into that
1.02%:  just walked into that one!!
0.55%:  thought you were a cred
3.88%:  thought you were a credible science
0.59%:  thought you were a credible science bro
0.55%:  just got an idea for a better science theory
1.55%:  just got an idea for a better science theory!!
0.55%:  need to get to the library for

0.96%:  need to get to the library for science books!!
0.55%:  really need to get back into science f
0.55%:  think you just argued the science
0.55%:  feel like just
0.55%:  think you just learned how to science better
0.55%:  just got turned on by science for the whole
0.55%:  just ignored
0.55%:  need to figure out how to roll
0.55%:  thought you were at
0.70%:  thought you were at least
0.55%:  wrote that theory
0.55%:  just blew science right out the back end!!
0.55%:  think science just got real for you
0.54%:  really need to figure out what colours
0.54%:  could be wrong about all of the science but there is
0.54%:  looked into the
1.62%:  looked into the future
0.54%:  could write a book about these!!
0.54%:  just got hit by a dark
0.54%:  just thought of a new baby
0.54%:  totally figured out the answer to science
0.54%:  just need to figure out a way to tell
0.54%:  just thought of a new science to be
3.99%:  just thought of a new science to be called
0.54%:  figured you
0.54%:  think you just forgot that science
0.54%:  think you just found all the science!!
0.54%:  just forgot how to breathe in
0.54%:  totally just figured out how to learn
0.73%:  totally just figured out how to learn science
0.54%:  could be wrong about any of these!!
0.54%:  forgot all about this theory and
0.54%:  just got an idea for how science totally
0.54%:  think you just had a real
0.56%:  think you just had a real science
0.54%:  could be talking about that
0.54%:  need to get out of science club
0.54%:  just figured out a science that
0.54%:  thought you were science bros but
0.54%:  think you just got called on
0.54%:  hate you for knowing so
0.54%:  could totally be wrong about so
0.54%:  hate you for knowing about science but
0.54%:  just figured out where to look
0.54%:  just thought of a better way science can be
0.54%:  thought we talked about your science
0.54%:  think you gotta
0.54%:  hate to be wrong about dark
0.54%:  should write a book about totally
0.54%:  forgot about that and now you
0.54%:  just thought of a way not
0.66%:  just thought of a way not to be killed
0.54%:  think we could be
1.55%:  think we could be onto
0.54%:  just thought of a science word!!
0.54%:  think you just changed our fr
0.54%:  just got a new theory for both
0.71%:  just got a new theory for both science
0.54%:  just figured out how to be able
0.54%:  feel like your
0.54%:  forgot to rule out that one because
0.54%:  just thought about it!!
0.54%:  totally forgot there could be another
0.54%:  just figured out how to be on
1.23%:  just figured out how to be on the science
0.54%:  just created the theory of all
0.54%:  need to think about how to argue
0.54%:  just got a new theory about the fabric
0.54%:  could be wrong about a lot of science but this
0.54%:  could be wrong about the rest of it!!
0.54%:  could totally get into science now
1.05%:  could totally get into science now!!
0.54%:  just figured out how to cheat on science!!
0.54%:  could be wrong about all of that but
0.54%:  just thought of a brand new science to call
0.54%:  just won the science theory
0.54%:  feel like the world just got both
0.54%:  hate science so
0.54%:  just thought of a new science about
0.70%:  just thought of a new science about dark
0.54%:  just figured out what all the science on black
0.54%:  just got hit by a science truck and all
0.54%:  just got hit by a science truck and there
0.54%:  think you just won the global science debate for 
0.54%:  think you just created enough
1.20%:  think you just created enough science
1.70%:  think you just created enough science for
0.65%:  think you just created enough science for all
0.54%:  just won the science debate for like
0.54%:  thought you were just a fan
0.54%:  need to work out
0.54%:  would like for that to be the case but science
0.54%:  just totally figured out a
0.54%:  will take that theory and run
0.54%:  think you just created new science for the
0.54%:  need to go write science books
0.54%:  think you just argued better
0.54%:  would like to hug the
0.54%:  think you just won the science debate of 
0.54%:  think you just brought science fact to bear on a
0.54%:  just thought of a book called
0.54%:  just figured out the science to a
0.54%:  need to go think about science!!
0.54%:  clearly need to write a book just
0.54%:  think we should all get science
0.54%:  totally just wrote science fact
0.54%:  think you just lowered the science bar too
0.54%:  just created a theory of how
0.54%:  feel like the science world has
0.54%:  feel like science should be about
0.54%:  forgot about black holes but now
0.54%:  think you should be our new science fact
0.54%:  just thought of a way science could be able
0.54%:  forgot to use
0.54%:  think you just got all of science on board
0.54%:  just got a new theory for that
0.54%:  just talked about science for a while!!
0.54%:  think we should totally go after
0.54%:  should write a blog about that one
1.45%:  should write a blog about that one!!
0.54%:  hate to be the first to call you wrong
0.54%:  just figured out how to call science

0.52%:  clearly need to write a book of science that
0.52%:  just changed the
0.52%:  just need to go back to the library for
0.52%:  totally just figured out how one
0.52%:  just got another science
0.52%:  just figured out that the only real science
0.52%:  just thought of a way to let
0.63%:  just thought of a way to let science
0.52%:  think you found the secret science
0.52%:  think you just won science for the good
0.52%:  think you just got a science bon

0.91%:  think you just got a science boner there
0.52%:  think you just blew all science out of the ocean!!
0.52%:  think you just learned about how
2.12%:  think you just learned about how science
0.52%:  just forgot how to think about science and
0.52%:  really think that could be our answer
0.51%:  hate to break this to our future
0.51%:  just had a great science
0.51%:  need to look this
0.51%:  totally forgot about science until
0.51%:  cannot allow this theory
0.51%:  would like to go to the science club
0.51%:  hate to be the guy to call
0.51%:  really ought to know
0.73%:  really ought to know about
1.25%:  really ought to know about this before
1.22%:  really ought to know about that
0.54%:  really ought to know about these
0.51%:  think the science just got real for you
0.51%:  feel like you just laughed
0.51%:  would like for that to be the least
0.51%:  think you just brought to
0.51%:  think you just brought down science at
0.51%:  forgot about the black holes and
0.51%:  totally just figured out the science break
0.51%:  would like that to be true for no reason!!
0.51%:  just created a science theory that will
0.51%:  feel like that just brought science and
0.51%:  really thought it was fake
0.51%:  forgot that you are
0.51%:  thought it was fake
0.51%:  just figured out how to balance all
1.47%:  just figured out how to balance all the science
0.51%:  think we just got the cool
0.51%:  could be totally wrong about the science this
0.51%:  just thought of dark bro
0.51%:  thought you were a credible science bro!!
0.51%:  forgot you could talk
0.51%:  could be talking about science now!!
0.51%:  hate to burst your balloon of science but there
0.51%:  totally just broke science with the
0.91%:  totally just broke science with the force
0.51%:  just totally figured out where the science
0.51%:  forgot there was other
0.83%:  forgot there was other science
0.51%:  could be wrong about the truth
2.18%:  could be wrong about the truth of reality
1.88%:  could be wrong about the truth of reality!!
0.51%:  think we just found that
0.51%:  need to work on that science
0.51%:  forgot about all this other junk!!
0.51%:  just figured out that all the black
0.51%:  could be looking
1.57%:  could be looking at the
0.51%:  could write that fan
0.51%:  forgot they were
0.69%:  forgot they were called
0.51%:  think you changed
0.51%:  just got blown out of the science ball
0.51%:  think you just changed all of science better
0.51%:  really should take that job
0.51%:  finally thought
0.51%:  really need to figure out how to back out
0.51%:  would totally forget about these
0.51%:  could talk about nothing
2.04%:  could talk about nothing but science
1.85%:  could talk about nothing but science for years
1.25%:  could talk about nothing else
0.81%:  could talk about nothing but science for three
0.82%:  could talk about nothing but science for three years
0.75%:  could talk about nothing but science for years!!
0.53%:  could talk about nothing else for three
0.51%:  just blew your entire science out the back of a
0.51%:  just thought of a way science could be in error
0.51%:  would totally agree to that if
0.51%:  think you just taught science to a
0.51%:  forgot all about science until
1.18%:  forgot all about science until just
0.51%:  need to borrow your science hat
0.51%:  need to figure out how to scroll
0.51%:  should write a book about science but only get
0.51%:  would like to hear your science
0.51%:  really need to get out of this science
2.37%:  really need to get out of this science club
0.74%:  really need to get out of this science club!!
0.51%:  forgot about the totally real science
0.51%:  think you just blew science out of the global
0.51%:  should totally get back
11.84%:  should totally get back into science
5.47%:  should totally get back into science!!

0.72%:  should totally get back into science after
0.63%:  should totally get back into science now
0.51%:  need to figure out what science looks
0.51%:  would argue that the science of
0.51%:  should write the book about
0.51%:  think you just won the cool
1.04%:  think you just won the cool science
0.51%:  just figured out the only science
0.55%:  just figured out the only science that
0.51%:  feel like that could be what
0.51%:  think you just got all of science turned
0.51%:  gotta talk
0.51%:  could be wrong about all the other fake science
0.51%:  just blew your science right out the door of
0.51%:  should really be working on that science
0.51%:  forgot to double
0.51%:  just figured out how to tell a science
0.83%:  just figured out how to tell a science teacher
0.51%:  think you just brought down all of science or
0.51%:  thought you wanted to be real
0.51%:  think you just wrote a better fan
0.51%:  just got better at science by
0.51%:  just figured out that science book
0.51%:  really just wanted to be right for once about science!!
0.51%:  could be wrong about it
0.51%:  think that could totally be science
0.51%:  just thought of real
2.47%:  just thought of real science
0.74%:  just thought of real dark
0.63%:  just thought of real science and
0.63%:  just thought of real science!!
0.57%:  just thought of real science to
0.91%:  just thought of real science to back

0.51%:  thought you were science friends but
0.51%:  just won the science for
0.54%:  just won the science for real
0.52%:  just won the science for today
0.51%:  would like to be best
0.51%:  just got an idea for where the
0.51%:  just thought of a way to do science!!
0.51%:  hate to be the one to burst your science world
2.29%:  hate to be the one to burst your science world ball
0.51%:  really need to start backing
0.51%:  feel like you just und
0.51%:  would like that to be an
0.51%:  like that better than regular science
0.51%:  like how you just brought science to bear
0.51%:  forgot to use science
0.51%:  just learned about science for
0.51%:  just got really tired
0.51%:  think you just won the science of our
0.51%:  think science just got really fr
0.51%:  just got a totally new idea for the
0.51%:  just got really into science for one
0.51%:  just figured out that all other
0.84%:  just figured out that all other science
0.51%:  just figured out they
0.51%:  thought you cared about science as
0.97%:  thought you cared about science as well
0.51%:  just got a theory that
0.51%:  just figured out how to better science!!
0.51%:  would totally go there if
0.51%:  think you just rewrote all of science to the
0.51%:  forgot about all the other science ner
0.54%:  forgot about all the other science nerds!!
0.51%:  just figured out that theory!!
0.51%:  forgot about the science word
0.51%:  would totally go see
0.51%:  could write a science book for teens about
0.51%:  just thought of a way to end science once
0.51%:  really thought it would take a
0.51%:  thought you wanted science talk
0.51%:  just noticed you brought
0.51%:  just got called out on a theory
0.51%:  need to figure out why that
0.51%:  think that would be a
0.51%:  just thought of a new science related book
0.51%:  think you just taught science a
0.51%:  forgot to include that joke
0.51%:  forgot that you were there
0.51%:  thought we could talk about non
0.51%:  think you just won the science for re
0.51%:  just thought of a way to include all
0.51%:  told you before that
0.51%:  would like to note that before
0.51%:  need to talk to this guy before
0.51%:  just got an idea for a book where the only
0.51%:  think we just found a cure
0.51%:  could be wrong about that one for
1.48%:  could be wrong about that one for sure
1.72%:  could be wrong about that one for sure!!
0.51%:  thought you were cooler
0.51%:  totally just figured out how to con
0.51%:  just blew science theory
0.90%:  just blew science theory out
0.51%:  see your
0.51%:  could go either
19.05%:  could go either way on that one!!
6.84%:  could go either way on that!!
0.92%:  could go either way on that last
1.72%:  could go either way on that last one!!
0.60%:  could go either way on that but
0.51%:  think you just got a science hard
0.51%:  thought we talked about science last
0.51%:  reject that idea
0.87%:  reject that idea out
0.51%:  think you just found science a whole
0.51%:  hate to break it to all you science bros out
0.51%:  just figured out how to battle
0.51%:  just thought of nine
0.51%:  totally forgot about those!!
0.51%:  really just wanted to go back
0.51%:  could be wrong about the rest of our
1.17%:  could be wrong about the rest of our science
0.63%:  could be wrong about the rest of our science!!
0.51%:  need to consult with
0.51%:  hate to be that guy but now
0.51%:  need to go buy
0.51%:  just told you what
0.51%:  just thought of like ten

0.51%:  just thought of a better ac
0.50%:  would totally be right about the
0.50%:  feel like you should not
0.50%:  forgot the answer could be science
0.50%:  was about to be
0.50%:  forgot to tell you there was a science
0.50%:  really should take better
0.50%:  totally forgot that we could
0.50%:  forgot about the science world
0.50%:  need to think about that all
0.50%:  could be wrong about a theory
0.60%:  could be wrong about a theory that
0.50%:  thought for sure science would be able to beat
0.50%:  thought for sure science would kill
0.50%:  really need to go to science school
0.50%:  just fell down the rabbit hole back
1.01%:  just fell down the rabbit hole back to science
0.50%:  hate to break it to your science bros but
0.50%:  hate to burst your balloon but if
0.50%:  would like for that to be a real
1.12%:  would like for that to be a real theory

0.50%:  just got a totally new science
0.50%:  think science just caught
0.50%:  totally forgot to include the science
0.50%:  need to think about that science
0.75%:  need to think about that science for
0.50%:  think you need to be careful about science
0.50%:  thought it was fake too but
0.50%:  was looking for trouble
0.83%:  was looking for trouble and trouble
0.50%:  clearly need to work out
0.50%:  just thought of one better!!
0.50%:  just got hit by a science truck and now all
0.50%:  need to go write a book about
0.50%:  would buy that science book right
0.50%:  need to tell you what
0.50%:  should really go
0.89%:  should really go back
1.28%:  should really go back to science
0.84%:  should really go to the science
1.16%:  should really go to the science centre
0.67%:  should really go to the science center
0.63%:  should really go back to science before
0.60%:  should really go back to the
0.50%:  cannot tell you how bad
0.50%:  could be totally wrong about this science for
0.50%:  forgot to include that science theory
0.50%:  just got an idea for the c
0.50%:  need to talk to you about the
0.64%:  need to talk to you about the science
0.50%:  think you just blew science the fr
0.50%:  wonder if you
0.50%:  think that could be totally
0.50%:  think you just brought real science to all of
0.50%:  totally bought
1.20%:  totally bought that for
3.36%:  totally bought that for a second!!

0.73%:  just blew all our science out the back door of
0.97%:  just blew all our science out the back door of the
0.50%:  would be so
0.50%:  think we all just got our science on today
0.50%:  just forgot how to science!!
0.50%:  just got talked into a new
2.32%:  just got talked into a new theory
8.90%:  just got talked into a new theory of science
16.38%:  just got talked into a new theory of science!!

3.09%:  think you just robbed all the science
1.24%:  think you just robbed all the science of
1.21%:  think you just robbed all the science out
0.50%:  just thought of a new science doctor
0.50%:  just got a bunch
3.01%:  just got a bunch of science
0.90%:  just got a bunch of new
0.98%:  just got a bunch of new science
0.50%:  just figured out that other
0.50%:  totally should write science fact
0.50%:  just figured out that non
0.50%:  just thought of our
0.50%:  just got a science boner real hard
0.72%:  just got a science boner real hard!!
0.50%:  just got turned on by science all

0.50%:  need to go talk to the
0.89%:  need to go talk to the science
0.50%:  think you just robbed all the cool
0.54%:  think you just robbed all the cool science
0.50%:  could be wrong about another science
1.00%:  could be wrong about another science theory
0.81%:  could be wrong about another science theory!!
0.50%:  think science just got really cool there for about
0.50%:  thought about it for one
0.83%:  thought about it for one second but
0.50%:  just felt a chill
0.50%:  think you just brought science too far and we
0.50%:  just figured out the one science
0.50%:  just called you out for not being a real science bro
0.68%:  just called you out for not being a real science bro!!
0.50%:  cannot be
0.50%:  should take
0.50%:  totally just wrote a science book here
0.50%:  totally forgot that whole
0.50%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science but it
0.50%:  could totally be right about an
0.50%:  just figured out the two
0.50%:  just figured out how to learn
0.50%:  could totally be working for the science
0.50%:  just wrote science fan
0.50%:  just got done with
0.50%:  think you just gotta
0.50%:  think you just changed two science
0.50%:  think you better watch
0.50%:  thought of a
1.00%:  thought of a counter
0.85%:  thought of a better
0.76%:  thought of a better answer
0.67%:  thought of a better reason
0.57%:  thought of a better reason to build
0.51%:  thought of a new
0.50%:  should write a science book for ner
0.50%:  should really think
0.72%:  should really think about science
1.64%:  should really think about science before
0.70%:  should really think before
0.50%:  could write a book about all the science just
0.50%:  need to call a
0.59%:  need to call a science
0.50%:  need to start looking for a
0.50%:  totally just figured out the science on how
0.50%:  need to tell you later

0.68%:  just got really hot for science!!
0.50%:  need to go talk about
0.61%:  need to go talk about this further
0.50%:  just thought of a brand new science you
0.50%:  should write a science book for the totally
0.50%:  totally just learned about science for
0.50%:  gotta think about how
0.50%:  hate how
0.50%:  kinda thought you were j
0.50%:  think you just won the science double
0.50%:  think you just forced science to be
0.50%:  just broke the science world!!
0.50%:  need to talk to that guy who
0.50%:  think the science just got real for real

0.50%:  thought science was real
0.50%:  just got hit by the dark
0.50%:  refuse to count that
0.50%:  would call that a theory
0.50%:  need to think of a better way
0.50%:  would like to see your science that
0.50%:  could be wrong about the science that
0.50%:  just broke science and now the
0.50%:  really want to go back to bed

0.55%:  could write a book just on the science of that!!
0.50%:  would like to reject your
0.50%:  just thought of a way to kill science and
0.50%:  feel like you just brought the science down on
0.50%:  should get back to the lab before
0.50%:  could totally be right about those fake
0.50%:  thought you were a science fact
0.50%:  think science just changed for

0.50%:  feel like that could be a story
0.50%:  think we all just found a science career
0.50%:  could totally write a book on the
3.71%:  could totally write a book on the science
0.50%:  need to go think about that science
0.50%:  really like the sound of that but science
0.50%:  totally forgot that whole dark
0.50%:  would like to be the science
0.50%:  just won the debate
0.50%:  totally just got the idea

0.49%:  really need to get back to this
0.49%:  need to call science right now before
0.49%:  just figured out how to talk to science ch
0.49%:  think you just created a science of the
0.49%:  just figured out how to science better
0.49%:  just wrote a book about the
0.50%:  just wrote a book about the science
1.06%:  just wrote a book about the science behind
0.49%:  could totally use that for a science book!!
0.49%:  could totally be a science hero

0.49%:  think you need to watch
0.49%:  could just
0.49%:  need to go back to your
0.49%:  wrote that book and
0.49%:  thought we could trust
1.16%:  thought we could trust science
0.49%:  used to think you were too
0.49%:  think you just called the science of our
0.49%:  hate to break it to our
0.49%:  totally just figured out how to be a black
0.49%:  was right about one
0.49%:  could really get into that one

0.49%:  just figured out why all that science
0.49%:  think you just changed science fr
0.49%:  think you just got real science for real once
0.49%:  just called you out for talking science that
0.49%:  can barely breathe
0.49%:  just created the science theory of all

0.49%:  thought you were in on
0.49%:  think you just won the science debate lot
0.49%:  should write a book about science bro
0.49%:  just totally blew science
0.63%:  just totally blew science out
0.49%:  just figured out that one!!
0.49%:  just got really turned on for like the
0.49%:  could write a book just about science
0.49%:  just created a new theory for science to look
0.49%:  should really write about
0.49%:  feel like we just brought science and
0.49%:  would buy that right
0.49%:  just told you the
0.49%:  would like that theory to be real!!
0.49%:  just forgot to
3.81%:  just forgot to breathe

4.84%:  would think about that for
9.68%:  would think about that for longer
9.58%:  would think about that for longer but
3.75%:  would think about that but
2.49%:  would think about that for a long
1.48%:  would think about that before
1.32%:  would think about that longer
2.13%:  would think about that longer but
0.94%:  would think that
0.77%:  would think about that for years
0.67%:  would think that before
0.67%:  would think about that for sure
0.61%:  would think that before you
0.58%:  would think about that for longer but science
0.57%:  would think about that one
0.78%:  would think about that one for
0.54%:  would think about that all
0.51%:  would think about that before you
0.49%:  would like that to be true for so
0.49%:  really ought to write a book on
0.49%:  really need to go to the wash
0.49%:  just won the science lottery for re
0.49%:  can barely breathe right
1.57%:  can barely breathe right now!!
0.49%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science theory!!
0.49%:  thought science was only for
0.49%:  think you just found a science to
0.49%:  just thought of a really bad counter
0.49%:  bet you could get a science job
0.86%:  bet you could get a science job with that one
2.82%:  bet you could get a science job with that one!!
0.79%:  bet you could get a science job with that!!
0.49%:  could be wrong about the last four
0.49%:  think we got
0.49%:  just thought of a really cute science
0.49%:  forgot all about science and
0.49%:  think you should be a science bro
0.49%:  think you are about
1.04%:  think you are about to blow
0.82%:  think you are about to change
1.85%:  think you are about to change science
0.49%:  just totally blew the
0.63%:  just totally blew the roof
0.49%:  cannot wait
1.77%:  cannot wait for
4.54%:  cannot wait for science
2.86%:  cannot wait for the science

0.55%:  cannot wait for the book
0.49%:  totally forgot about science while
0.49%:  think you just grabbed the science ball out
0.49%:  totally forgot to answer the dark
0.49%:  would like for that theory to be real!!
0.49%:  just wrote a science book in the
0.49%:  just figured out how to create another
0.49%:  could be totally wrong about our
0.54%:  could be totally wrong about our entire
0.49%:  should write a science book about the fact
0.49%:  think you should get a job at science central
0.49%:  think you just rewrote science for that
0.49%:  can think of a better theory!!
0.49%:  just thought about it for a
0.49%:  forgot you weren
0.49%:  feel like science just had
0.49%:  always forget that there
0.49%:  just wanted
1.53%:  just wanted to talk
1.18%:  just wanted to talk about science
0.69%:  just wanted to argue
0.73%:  just wanted to argue about
0.65%:  just wanted to talk about flying
0.49%:  could be wrong about that last one but
0.49%:  just figured out how to call the
0.49%:  think you just created a new science blog
1.10%:  think you just created a new science blog for
0.49%:  just found out how to get
0.49%:  think he
1.66%:  think he just blew
1.13%:  think he just blew our
1.12%:  think he just called
0.61%:  think he just blew your
0.56%:  think he just got
0.49%:  just figured out that what science
0.49%:  totally just thought of a new and
0.49%:  think you just rewrote the face
0.49%:  think you just rewrote science to reflect
0.49%:  totally should write that book before
0.49%:  need to talk about this later
0.90%:  need to talk about this later!!
0.49%:  think science just got real for you there
0.49%:  just got called out by a science bro on
0.49%:  just got called out by science in
1.85%:  just got called out by science in front
0.51%:  just got called out by science in the
0.49%:  should write a book about your
0.49%:  could be totally wrong about these freak
0.49%:  should totally get a science book written before
0.49%:  think we just got an
0.49%:  think we just got science done
0.52%:  think we just got science done!!
0.49%:  really need to get back into science for just
0.49%:  totally just broke down
1.51%:  totally just broke down the science
0.73%:  totally just broke down the science of the
0.55%:  totally just broke down the fourth
0.49%:  just figured out what the key
0.49%:  could be totally wrong about the science for this
0.49%:  think you just got to the real
0.49%:  feel like you just brought science harder
0.49%:  would be the first one to tell
0.49%:  think you just rewrote all science for the good
0.49%:  would rather eat
0.49%:  think science just taught
0.49%:  really need to start being
0.49%:  just hit you
0.49%:  need to tell you later about how science
0.49%:  need to get back to this later
0.94%:  need to get back to this later!!
0.49%:  think we just found real science to be
0.49%:  could totally be a science hero right
0.54%:  could totally be a science hero right now but
0.49%:  kinda just thought of a
0.58%:  kinda just thought of a really
0.49%:  really need to get to work on this science
0.49%:  just got owned by the
0.61%:  just got owned by the science
0.49%:  just figured out a way to both be
0.49%:  think we just got to the core of all
3.15%:  think we just got to the core of all science
1.51%:  think we just got to the core of all science!!
0.59%:  think we just got to the core of all science and
0.49%:  just figured out how to be eternal
0.49%:  just figured out how to be really science
0.49%:  thought for sure it
1.10%:  thought for sure it would
0.49%:  think science just got real for a hot
0.49%:  thought for sure science couldn
0.49%:  had totally
0.49%:  could be wrong about that last theory!!
0.49%:  feel like that theory just got science
0.49%:  could be the first guy to know that
0.49%:  thought you were into science before!!
0.49%:  just figured all
0.92%:  just figured all that
1.71%:  just figured all that out!!
0.63%:  just figured all that out by
0.60%:  just figured all that out on
0.49%:  should buy
0.70%:  should buy a ticket
7.70%:  should buy a ticket to the science
1.22%:  should buy a ticket to that
1.67%:  should buy a ticket to that science
0.60%:  should buy a ticket for
2.87%:  should buy a ticket for that science
1.03%:  should buy a ticket for the
1.47%:  should buy a ticket for the science
0.63%:  should buy a ticket for the science lot
0.51%:  should buy lot
0.49%:  just blew your science right out of the balloon
0.49%:  think you just learned the
0.49%:  think we all just agreed on science
0.62%:  think we all just agreed on science for
0.49%:  need to figure out how to clear
0.49%:  should totally write a science book about reject
0.49%:  would be really into
2.39%:  would be really into that!!
0.49%:  just had a new
1.68%:  just had a new theory
11.77%:  just had a new theory about
4.22%:  just had a new theory for
1.64%:  just had a new theory of
1.51%:  just had a new theory of science
0.72%:  just had a new theory of science!!

0.49%:  thought you were out of science cards
0.52%:  thought you were out of science cards!!
0.49%:  think you just got elected
0.49%:  could be a science
0.49%:  thought for sure you wanted
1.14%:  thought for sure you wanted to talk
0.49%:  cannot tell you how hard
0.49%:  totally just forgot dark
0.49%:  just broke through into
0.49%:  thought you were outside
0.49%:  just figured out how to learn science
0.49%:  would like that to be a theory
0.49%:  would like that to be the least
0.49%:  totally forgot about the weird
0.58%:  totally forgot about the weird science
0.49%:  just got an idea for how the
0.49%:  would like to enter
0.53%:  would like to enter that
0.57%:  would like to enter that theory
0.49%:  just figured out how the science really
0.49%:  forgot to include the laws
0.49%:  can just feel the
0.49%:  should write a book about the science for
0.49%:  think you just counted
0.49%:  know this theory
0.49%:  just got all the way out of science and
0.49%:  just got called out by a science writer for not
0.49%:  cannot wait for science to be
0.49%:  just created a science theory about how
0.49%:  totally just thought of science in
0.49%:  think science just found out who ate
0.77%:  think science just found out who ate all
0.49%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science in
0.48%:  can feel the science world
0.48%:  really just wanted to go to the
0.52%:  really just wanted to go to the beach
0.48%:  would like for that to be true real
0.48%:  think you just brought science to bear on fol
0.48%:  really ought to write these
0.48%:  just thought of a science to
0.48%:  think you just created a science ho
0.48%:  just got science idea
0.48%:  just figured out not only the whole
0.48%:  think you found out
1.34%:  think you found out what
0.48%:  think we found the science guy
0.56%:  think we found the science guy!!
0.48%:  think you just let science out
8.56%:  think you just let science out of the bag!!
1.19%:  think you just let science out of the bag and
0.48%:  just figured out how to be both a real
0.48%:  just blew your entire science out of the back door
0.48%:  think science just found out there really
0.48%:  just blew your entire science out of the ball
0.48%:  forgot that this
0.48%:  just found a new theory to
0.48%:  was talking to a
0.48%:  thought we could trust science to
0.48%:  forgot that other
0.48%:  need to get out of this country!!
0.48%:  just got trick
2.63%:  just got tricked by science
0.78%:  just got tricked by a science
0.54%:  just got tricked by science!!
0.48%:  hate to break this to you all but we
0.48%:  hate you for knowing that because
0.48%:  could talk about nothing else but
0.48%:  was about to go
0.48%:  forgot to rule out those
0.48%:  thought you were nuts
2.75%:  thought you were nuts before
0.48%:  could write a book just on that one
0.48%:  should be a
1.35%:  should be a science
9.85%:  should be a science teacher
10.41%:  should be a science teacher!!
2.93%:  should be a science writer
2.31%:  should be a science writer!!

0.84%:  should be a science guy
0.54%:  should be a science guy!!
0.48%:  just want to be clear about
0.48%:  just totally figured out how to be a real science
0.48%:  think you just found a science teacher
0.48%:  think you just threw science fact out
0.48%:  need to go think about how science just
0.48%:  need to talk to a higher
0.48%:  think you just won the science card for
0.48%:  should totally write out
0.48%:  could be totally wrong about that one
0.48%:  forgot about all the science that would
0.48%:  just got hit by a science fact!!
0.48%:  just figured out how to be really cool at
0.74%:  just figured out how to be really cool at science
0.48%:  just thought of a brand new colour
0.48%:  think you just found the greater
0.48%:  like you just
0.71%:  like you just the
0.48%:  think you just argued for a
0.48%:  could totally write that for
2.31%:  could totally write that for science
0.48%:  just got owned by science factual
0.48%:  should really write a science book but
0.50%:  should really write a science book but then
0.48%:  need to go take
2.05%:  need to go take a shower!!
0.48%:  used to think they
0.48%:  always forget that science could
0.48%:  just blew all our science out the back of
0.48%:  just got a better idea for science!!
0.48%:  need to talk to you all
0.48%:  just blew all our science right the
0.48%:  just thought of a way black
0.48%:  just wrote the science
0.48%:  just thought of a ret
0.48%:  just got turned on to science bro
0.48%:  think you just let out
0.48%:  should write a book on science!!
0.48%:  see through you
0.48%:  really need to go back to that
0.61%:  really need to go back to that science
0.48%:  can totally see that working for our science!!
0.48%:  thought you were fake bros too but
0.48%:  think you just got the science bro
0.48%:  just need to go back to the library now
0.48%:  just thought of a rad science
0.48%:  totally forgot how dark
0.48%:  should really go to science
0.51%:  should really go to science con
0.48%:  just thought of a way to beat
0.48%:  clearly need to work on that
0.48%:  really need to watch science
0.48%:  figured out what the
0.48%:  just thought of it and science
0.48%:  would be the first to thank
0.70%:  would be the first to thank science
0.48%:  reject this theory on two
0.48%:  think we just created a science theory of
1.31%:  think we just created a science theory of our
0.48%:  just got all the science bon
0.48%:  knew science
0.48%:  wrote a science book about
1.38%:  wrote a science book about that!!
0.59%:  wrote a science book about that once
0.49%:  wrote a science book about this
0.68%:  wrote a science book about this!!
0.48%:  reject your entire thought
0.48%:  need to look this theory
0.48%:  had to
0.48%:  would argue that they are still
0.48%:  forgot to tell you because
0.48%:  need to work at
0.48%:  forgot all about non
0.48%:  should totally write a book for the science genre
0.48%:  just thought of a totally new role
0.48%:  thought of a better answer!!
0.48%:  think our science teacher would
0.48%:  really should go to the science fair
0.48%:  told you science was the
0.58%:  told you science was the future
0.61%:  told you science was the future!!
0.48%:  thought you were jealous

0.48%:  think our science has
0.48%:  really need to get out of this town!!
0.48%:  could totally be working for science
0.48%:  would like for that theory to be real just
0.48%:  just ruined the
0.48%:  think for once science
0.48%:  just thought of a retort!!
0.48%:  could be wrong about the science but if

0.76%:  just blew all the science right out of your back end
0.75%:  just blew all the science right out of our
0.60%:  just blew all the science right out of your ear!!
0.46%:  just blew all the science out of the dark
0.44%:  just thought of a way science could be a lot
0.44%:  really should get on
0.49%:  really should get on that science
0.44%:  just got a better idea of
0.47%:  just got a better idea of how
0.44%:  thought you were about science not
0.44%:  just forgot about the entire science
0.44%:  totally just wrote a science book right here and
0.44%:  think you just caught an
0.44%:  need to go to the library or
0.44%:  think that could just about be science
0.44%:  totally just broke science and now there
0.44%:  think you just found the r
0.44%:  think you could get a job
0.44%:  just figured out how to clear the
0.44%:  could be wrong about these science
0.44%:  should write a letter to the science book
0.93%:  should write a letter to the science book club
0.52%:  should write a letter to the science book club!!
0.44%:  could be wrong about the history of science but at
0.44%:  think you just got cold
0.44%:  just called you out for not being there
0.44%:  could write a book about you!!
0.44%:  thought you were all science bros!!
0.44%:  should write a book of that
0.44%:  really just figured out what black
0.44%:  need to figure out how to back out
0.44%:  can totally get on board with the science of
0.44%:  hate you for knowing about that science!!

0.45%:  think you were born just to tell
0.44%:  used to think you were j
0.44%:  think our science teacher forgot about
0.44%:  think you just lowered the bar of science to
0.44%:  totally just thought of our new science career
0.44%:  just thought of new science to do!!
0.44%:  like the sound of that but now
0.44%:  just talked about the
0.65%:  just talked about the science
0.44%:  would like to argue that the
0.44%:  think you just found the better
0.48%:  think you just found the better science
0.44%:  need to get back in science
0.44%:  forgot that when
0.61%:  forgot that when you
0.44%:  totally want
0.59%:  totally want to be
0.44%:  totally just figured the
0.47%:  totally just figured the whole
0.44%:  could be wrong about the rest of reality but science
0.44%:  hate to burst your bucket
0.44%:  thought for certain you were done
0.44%:  could be wrong about that first
0.44%:  thought you were real just
0.44%:  totally forgot we could use the
0.44%:  just figured out how to be really cool science
0.44%:  really screw
0.44%:  want to be dark
0.44%:  could talk about this theory for a
1.02%:  could talk about this theory for a long
0.44%:  thought we settled
0.44%:  just thought of a real counter
0.44%:  like your face
0.44%:  think you just won the science bro battle for
0.44%:  just talked about science out
0.44%:  totally forgot that science is real
0.44%:  just got an idea for a science rock
0.44%:  think you just created a better science of
0.44%:  would like to see a cart
1.02%:  would like to see a cartoon of that!!
0.44%:  could be wrong about this only
0.44%:  should look into that later
0.44%:  think you just rewrote the science around
0.44%:  just got an idea for three
0.80%:  just got an idea for three new science
0.64%:  just got an idea for three science
0.44%:  could be talking to you
0.44%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier
0.53%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier today
0.86%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier today!!
0.44%:  should get a book
0.44%:  just wrote a science book that you can
0.44%:  think you just blew science and
0.44%:  just talked to science
0.44%:  should get back to you on that in about
0.44%:  think you just won science or
0.44%:  thought you were a bro but
0.44%:  think you just rewrote the front
0.44%:  would totally get on
0.44%:  should write a book for science that
0.44%:  like the sound of your science but
0.44%:  should get back to the library to
0.44%:  should totally write a book of science truth
0.44%:  think we just found our science to
0.44%:  need to figure out how to just
0.44%:  think that could just be your
0.44%:  feel like science just got the cool
0.44%:  agree
1.42%:  agree with you for
2.73%:  agree with you for once
2.48%:  agree with you for once!!
1.13%:  agree with you!!
0.44%:  feel like we just caught
0.44%:  just got science hard on you!!
0.44%:  forgot to think about what science
0.44%:  could be wrong about all the science of
0.44%:  just thought of a new science role
0.44%:  need to go look that
0.44%:  just thought it
0.44%:  need to get back to the library now
0.58%:  need to get back to the library now!!
0.44%:  just created a new theory of science on
0.44%:  just got really worried about the fate
0.44%:  thought you cared about science for real
0.44%:  just got hit by a truck of science real hard!!
0.44%:  think we both just found science
0.44%:  feel like science just got way too hard
0.44%:  thought you were all about deb
0.44%:  just figured out real science by
0.44%:  could be wrong on this!!
0.44%:  totally just broke the science world!!
0.44%:  could be totally wrong about the science here if
0.44%:  wrote a science book!!
0.44%:  need to figure out how to clone
0.44%:  think you just threw out a science fact!!
0.44%:  just figured out a new science
1.67%:  just figured out a new science theory
2.83%:  just figured out a new science theory!!
0.94%:  just figured out a new science theory that
0.44%:  just got hit by another one
0.44%:  just got a new theory for science bro
0.44%:  really thought we settled
0.44%:  want that to be the
0.44%:  would like that science to be taught
0.44%:  sure would like to hang
0.47%:  sure would like to hang out there
0.44%:  like what
1.58%:  like what you just
0.44%:  should totally write another book after
0.44%:  just broke through science to create
0.44%:  could be wrong about the rest of that!!
0.44%:  really should write a science book for once
0.44%:  forgot about the actual
2.91%:  forgot about the actual science
2.38%:  forgot about the actual science behind
1.33%:  forgot about the actual science!!
0.44%:  could be talking about science for years
0.44%:  forgot about all the science we
0.44%:  just figured out how to be eternal!!
0.44%:  figured that one out by
0.44%:  hate to sound like your
0.44%:  just thought of a way to clean
0.44%:  really should get back to science before it
0.44%:  could use a little
0.44%:  thought we could trust science before
0.44%:  need to change
0.44%:  just figured out what to call the science
0.53%:  just figured out what to call the science book
0.44%:  really should be working on better
0.52%:  really should be working on better science
0.44%:  was right there
0.44%:  think science just got really hot
0.58%:  think science just got really hot for
0.44%:  find
1.06%:  find your
1.74%:  find your lack
0.44%:  just won the science club debate
0.44%:  swear to god you
0.44%:  just found the hole
0.44%:  feel like science just got way cooler but
0.44%:  think you just cured all of science at the
0.44%:  forgot to rule out black hole
0.44%:  need to look further into that
0.66%:  need to look further into that!!
0.44%:  totally need to figure out how to science
0.44%:  feel like you just brought science onto
0.44%:  thought science was only for ner
0.44%:  really should know about the
2.08%:  really should know about the science
6.42%:  really should know about the science before
0.85%:  really should know about the science better
0.44%:  forgot about black holes and other
0.44%:  just found a way to be both
1.53%:  just found a way to be both right
0.44%:  would like to see your science on
2.64%:  would like to see your science on that!!
0.44%:  forgot about the third reason
0.44%:  just got turned on by a science teacher for
0.44%:  could be totally wrong but that
0.44%:  would totally go to that
0.44%:  need to tell you how
0.44%:  thought you were for once
0.44%:  just thought of a way to retro
0.44%:  already know about the
0.44%:  really like the sound of that now!!
0.44%:  would like that to be true oh
0.44%:  like that better than regular science!!
0.44%:  do not like that theory!!
0.44%:  just touched
0.45%:  just touched the
0.44%:  need to figure out how to turn back
0.44%:  really just want to argue
0.44%:  just fell down a rabbit hole onto
0.44%:  now
0.44%:  clearly need to write that science book!!
0.44%:  forgot about that black hole science
0.44%:  forgot about all the science you know that
0.44%:  need to figure out how to let
0.44%:  just got really into science for about three whole
0.44%:  think we just found the actual science to
0.44%:  think you just won our science debate for real
0.56%:  think you just won our science debate for real!!
0.44%:  need to talk to the other guys
0.44%:  just need to figure out how all
0.60%:  just need to figure out how all that
0.44%:  could totally write that book for
1.28%:  could totally write that book for science
0.44%:  think we all just heard our
0.44%:  could write books about that science!!
0.44%:  really thought it would be because
0.50%:  really thought it would be because of
0.44%:  could talk about the science of the
0.44%:  should go back to the
0.84%:  should go back to the library
0.44%:  should write for the
0.44%:  think you just rewrote all of our science and
0.44%:  really need to write science books!!
0.44%:  want to hug
0.56%:  want to hug you so
0.87%:  want to hug you so bad
0.47%:  want to hug you so hard!!
0.44%:  could totally see that working for science but
0.44%:  totally need to work for the
1.31%:  totally need to work for the science
0.44%:  forgot to tell you earlier but
0.44%:  thought you were just nice
0.44%:  forgot to talk about science!!
0.44%:  could get really
3.34%:  could get really into that!!
0.96%:  could get really into that science
0.85%:  could get really into science
0.44%:  was looking for that!!
0.44%:  just blew all your science right out of the boat
0.44%:  forgot you can
0.44%:  hate to be the one to burst your wild science
0.44%:  finally got
0.44%:  just won the science for today!!
0.44%:  totally just got burned
0.44%:  just got a bunch of really
0.44%:  just broke science with the
0.45%:  just broke science with the force
0.44%:  need to tell you about how
0.44%:  would argue that if you
0.44%:  hate to break this to you but we call
0.44%:  should totally win science
0.44%:  like you but that
0.44%:  totally figured out the answer!!
0.44%:  really thought for sure science would be on
0.44%:  really hate to be wrong
4.74%:  really hate to be wrong about this but
1.64%:  really hate to be wrong about this!!
0.55%:  really hate to be wrong but
0.44%:  do not care for your science tonight
0.44%:  need science to figure out what colour the
0.79%:  need science to figure out what colour the sky
0.44%:  really liked
0.44%:  really ought to know about that before
0.44%:  just thought of a new science book deal
0.44%:  think you just grabbed the crown of science out
0.44%:  could totally write the science book
0.44%:  just need to get back to science
0.44%:  just told you that there
0.44%:  do not know if that theory
0.43%:  just thought about an
0.43%:  hate to break it to you but no
0.43%:  would hug
0.89%:  would hug you if
0.44%:  would hug you for
0.43%:  should totally be a science bro
0.43%:  feel really good
6.03%:  feel really good about this
4.76%:  feel really good about that
2.22%:  feel really good about science
1.03%:  feel really good about the
0.99%:  feel really good about that joke
0.81%:  feel really good about that just
3.02%:  feel really good about that just now!!
0.73%:  feel really good about this one

0.69%:  feel really good about this!!
0.68%:  feel really good about this joke
0.66%:  feel really good about that joke!!
0.60%:  feel really good about science just
2.91%:  feel really good about science just now!!
0.60%:  feel really good about this now
1.11%:  feel really good about this now!!
0.59%:  feel really good about that!!
0.56%:  feel really good about what
0.68%:  feel really good about what just
0.53%:  feel really good about science now
0.70%:  feel really good about science now!!
0.53%:  feel really good about not
0.47%:  feel really good about this joke now
1.22%:  feel really good about this joke now!!
0.46%:  feel really good about the science
0.45%:  feel really good about that one
2.23%:  feel really good about that one!!
0.43%:  would listen
4.97%:  would listen to that theory
2.55%:  would listen to that theory!!
2.26%:  would listen to that theory for
0.86%:  would listen to that lecture
0.95%:  would listen to that lecture for
0.65%:  would listen to that theory for science
0.57%:  would listen to your
0.44%:  would listen to your science
0.43%:  hate to be the one to burst your orb
0.43%:  thought it was a joke
0.43%:  think for once we
0.43%:  think you just brought science to a debate
0.43%:  hate to break this to our future science
0.43%:  thought science was fake
0.57%:  thought science was fake too but
0.43%:  just got a science boner you
0.43%:  just blew all the science right out of your neck
0.43%:  thought science was about to finally
0.43%:  just got an idea for the book
0.43%:  feel like science just got real!!
0.43%:  think you just won our science battle!!
0.43%:  just called you out for not being science bro
0.43%:  just wanted to be
0.54%:  just wanted to be right
0.50%:  just wanted to be right for
3.71%:  just wanted to be right for once!!
0.86%:  just wanted to be right for once about
0.73%:  just wanted to be right for once okay
0.55%:  just wanted to be right for once but
0.43%:  could write a science book about the truth
0.43%:  thought you were a real science bro!!
0.43%:  forgot the answer to dark
0.43%:  think you just won the science race to
0.43%:  refuse to take you
0.43%:  think you just got around
0.43%:  just thought about it and science
0.43%:  think we just created an
0.43%:  should totally write a book on the science fact
0.43%:  really want dark
0.43%:  got you
1.08%:  got you there
0.43%:  could write a book of that
0.43%:  was trying to be
0.43%:  totally just wrote a science book in the
0.43%:  could write books about that science theory
0.43%:  think that could just be our new
0.43%:  would still argue that your
0.43%:  feel like you just brought a lot
0.43%:  really need to figure out how to talk to ch
0.43%:  just thought of a new science book title and you
0.43%:  think we just found all the science to
0.43%:  should write that book you
0.43%:  think you just went full science bro there!!
0.43%:  swear to god if you turn
0.43%:  do not care about your
0.75%:  do not care about your science
0.43%:  really need to look further into that!!
0.43%:  should totally write a book about un
0.43%:  totally just blew the science
0.43%:  think you just created the science for a
0.43%:  just blew that
0.99%:  just blew that theory to
0.79%:  just blew that theory out of our
0.43%:  would like to be the last guy
0.43%:  need to go think about other
0.43%:  think you just def
0.43%:  thought you were all about science first
0.43%:  just figured out all other
1.56%:  just figured out all other science
0.43%:  could be right about all of science!!
0.43%:  think you just blew out the candle
0.43%:  just got called out by another science bro for
0.43%:  really need to know about this science
0.43%:  think we found the secret to your
0.43%:  kinda just thought of a really cool
1.63%:  kinda just thought of a really cool science
0.43%:  feel like science just caught
0.43%:  think you just blew science for the
0.43%:  feel like you just went through science and
0.43%:  think you just got a bunch
3.69%:  think you just got a bunch of science
1.58%:  think you just got a bunch of science bro
0.43%:  think you should get a science fact
0.43%:  think you just cut
0.43%:  think we found the last
0.43%:  just thought of a really bad science lecture
0.43%:  would like to buy that science teacher
0.43%:  just need to figure out how to tell black
0.43%:  thought for sure science would totally be
0.43%:  need to start working at
0.44%:  need to start working at a science
0.43%:  just got turned on by a science lecture for like
0.43%:  hate you for being such
0.43%:  should write a book about science totally
0.43%:  forgot all about the non
0.43%:  think you just brought order
0.43%:  just figured out how to create real science
0.43%:  think that could really
0.83%:  think that could really be true
0.43%:  only
0.59%:  only thought
1.42%:  only thought about
1.13%:  only thought about dark
0.43%:  could be wrong about this but okay
0.43%:  could be wrong about all the science there
0.43%:  just thought of a cool idea
0.43%:  thought about it real
0.43%:  just wrote a book on
1.05%:  just wrote a book on that!!
0.50%:  just wrote a book on that theory
0.74%:  just wrote a book on that theory!!
0.43%:  just figured out why black hole
0.43%:  totally should be working for the science center!!
0.43%:  do not know about science but that
0.43%:  do not like your face
0.43%:  need to science that
0.73%:  need to science that right
0.43%:  forgot there were still
0.43%:  really need to track
0.43%:  need to go throw
0.43%:  think you just won the science debate club tro
0.43%:  really need to talk to other
0.43%:  was like
0.67%:  was like totally
0.43%:  need to go to the library to learn science
0.43%:  just called you fake too
0.43%:  think you just went too hard
0.43%:  just blew your science right out of the door
0.46%:  just blew your science right out of the door!!
0.43%:  just felt a chill go
0.43%:  just got idea
1.07%:  just got idea for science
0.99%:  just got idea for science career
0.69%:  just got idea for a new theory
0.67%:  just got idea for a science
0.61%:  just got idea for new
1.22%:  just got idea for new science
1.33%:  just got idea for new science theory
1.93%:  just got idea for new science theory!!
1.20%:  just got idea for new theory

0.61%:  just got idea for new book
0.55%:  just got idea for new science career
0.55%:  just got idea for a new science
0.51%:  just got idea for new book!!
0.43%:  just had a new theory about science!!
0.43%:  clearly need to write a book about just
0.43%:  really need to write that science
1.06%:  really need to write that science book
0.60%:  really need to write that science book!!
0.43%:  just figured out not only all the
1.15%:  just figured out not only all the science
0.43%:  totally forgot that could be a
0.43%:  should totally write a science book the
0.43%:  should really know
1.04%:  should really know about
1.79%:  should really know about that
1.46%:  should really know about that before
0.71%:  should really know better
9.47%:  should really know better than to argue
35.22%:  should really know better than to argue science
0.78%:  should really know better than to get
0.53%:  should really know better than to go
0.43%:  thought you were into science but
0.43%:  hate that you just broke down
0.43%:  feel like science just got rad
0.43%:  should write a book of science about that
1.07%:  should write a book of science about that!!
0.43%:  hate to be the one to burst your fun science ball
0.43%:  forget what the
0.43%:  just got turned on science!!
0.43%:  refuse to rule that theory
1.42%:  refuse to rule that theory out!!
0.43%:  should write a science book for actual
0.43%:  hate to break the news to all of
3.07%:  hate to break the news to all of science
4.32%:  hate to break the news to all of science but
1.27%:  hate to break the news to all of you but
0.71%:  hate to break the news to all of science but you

0.43%:  could talk about this theory for 
0.43%:  need to figure out how to say that back
0.43%:  hate you!!
0.43%:  would like that to be our theory of science
0.43%:  totally forgot that was science
0.43%:  can just about feel the
0.57%:  can just about feel the science
0.43%:  feel like you just got a bunch
0.43%:  just talked to a science guy who
0.43%:  bet you thought science was all

0.43%:  would like to go on the science
0.43%:  totally just forgot what science
0.43%:  could be wrong but this
0.44%:  could be wrong but this theory
0.43%:  do not know about this science!!
0.43%:  really need to talk to a

0.41%:  could totally write a science book one
0.41%:  really should get back on
0.43%:  really should get back on the
0.62%:  really should get back on the science
0.98%:  really should get back on the science train
0.41%:  think you could get a science job
0.41%:  was not
0.41%:  think we all just found a science theory to argue
0.41%:  would like to hug you for that last
0.41%:  hate to burst your balloon but if dark
0.41%:  just figured out the black
0.41%:  totally forget
0.41%:  need to write a science story
0.89%:  need to write a science story for
0.53%:  need to write a science story about
0.41%:  would rather you not tell
0.41%:  forgot about how science
0.41%:  need to borrow your black
0.41%:  forgot to rule out all the other
0.41%:  just got an idea for how to be the
0.41%:  think that one
0.41%:  just figured out how they eat
0.41%:  think the world just got science
0.41%:  really just want to talk
0.41%:  thought it was already
0.41%:  hate to break the news but your
0.41%:  could totally see that working on science
0.41%:  like that theory a
1.63%:  like that theory a lot!!
0.41%:  feel like that could be worth a
0.41%:  think we better call science
0.62%:  think we better call science about
0.41%:  should write the science
0.41%:  think you just created a science blog worth
0.41%:  just figured out how to talk to ner
0.41%:  think that could just be science!!
0.41%:  think you just brought science fact down a
0.41%:  just called you out for being both
0.41%:  forgot to think about science because
0.41%:  just thought of a way to be liked
0.41%:  could be wrong about the science but let
0.41%:  do not know about the
2.41%:  do not know about the science
1.99%:  do not know about the science but
0.91%:  do not know about the science here
0.91%:  do not know about the science of
1.55%:  do not know about the science of this but
0.70%:  do not know about the science here but clearly
0.70%:  do not know about the science of this but clearly
0.61%:  do not know about the science there
0.44%:  do not know about the future
0.41%:  just figured out how to totally break
3.24%:  just figured out how to totally break science
2.78%:  just figured out how to totally break science!!
0.41%:  thought you were a bro science
0.41%:  think you just found a science career worth
0.41%:  feel like you just went through too
0.41%:  thought you were about science and facts!!
0.41%:  used to think of
0.41%:  just killed the science theory
0.41%:  could be wrong about any of the science but
0.41%:  just thought of a really better
0.41%:  would argue that if that
0.41%:  forgot that you were there!!
0.41%:  just wrote an entire book of science that could
0.41%:  thought we could only use
1.09%:  thought we could only use science
0.48%:  thought we could only use science for
0.41%:  really ought to write a book and
0.41%:  forgot about the real answer
0.65%:  forgot about the real answer!!
0.41%:  forgot about all the science because
0.41%:  think we all just got burned
3.04%:  think we all just got burned by science
1.70%:  think we all just got burned by science!!
0.45%:  think we all just got burned by our
0.43%:  think we all just got burned by science for
0.41%:  think you just rewrote the science about
0.41%:  just wrote a theory
0.77%:  just wrote a theory about
0.41%:  kinda just thought of a science
0.41%:  just wrote an entire book that could
0.41%:  just got an idea for another book where
0.41%:  just blew all your science out the back of the boat!!
0.41%:  do not care what you just
0.41%:  would like to eat that
0.41%:  clearly need to start science
1.91%:  clearly need to start science blog
0.41%:  could be wrong about the rest of reality but oh
0.41%:  think our science teacher just got a
0.41%:  think you just got too real for a
0.41%:  figured out the answer to one
0.41%:  thought you were out for
0.41%:  could be wrong about a ton
0.49%:  could be wrong about a ton of science
0.41%:  think you just changed all of science to be real
0.41%:  should write a book about all the f
0.41%:  would like to eat that theory
0.57%:  would like to eat that theory for
0.41%:  need to tell you later about what
0.41%:  totally just thought of real science in
0.42%:  totally just thought of real science in order
0.41%:  think science just got really far
0.41%:  used to think you weren
0.41%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but it
0.41%:  feel like that one
0.43%:  feel like that one could
0.41%:  hate to be racist but you
0.41%:  need to go to the science library after lunch to
0.41%:  think you just changed all science to be about fr
0.41%:  should totally write a book counter
0.41%:  think we just found science that
0.41%:  should totally write a science fact book or
0.41%:  think you should get a science career
0.41%:  forgot to think about outer
0.41%:  totally forgot about the word
0.41%:  totally forgot about such
0.41%:  should write a book on science theory
0.41%:  think you just got science real hard
0.41%:  just blew all our science and
0.41%:  totally forgot that could be science!!
0.41%:  think science just got a lot cooler for
0.41%:  think you just changed all science to be true
0.41%:  just blew all our science out of the back
0.41%:  just figured out how all three
0.41%:  totally forgot about the science answer
1.00%:  totally forgot about the science answer!!
0.41%:  think you just rewrote the natural
0.41%:  totally just found out where the
0.41%:  totally need to look
0.41%:  think you just changed science for 
0.41%:  cannot wait for science to get here
0.90%:  cannot wait for science to get here!!
0.41%:  really need to work on this blog
0.41%:  could be wrong about all of the science but it
0.41%:  forgot all about this theory but
0.41%:  would like to shout that
0.41%:  just wrote a science fact book that
0.41%:  can think of about three
0.41%:  really ought to look
0.41%:  really need to figure out how to shut science
0.41%:  could be wrong about all the science for one
0.41%:  could be talking to a future science star
0.59%:  could be talking to a future science star!!
0.41%:  forgot about all the science until
1.06%:  forgot about all the science until just
4.33%:  forgot about all the science until just now!!
0.41%:  could totally write the science book for
0.41%:  need to get to work on this!!
0.41%:  forgot about that theory we
0.41%:  would look into that further because science
0.41%:  just bought dark
0.41%:  totally just got an
3.57%:  totally just got an idea for science
1.66%:  totally just got an idea for science!!
1.02%:  totally just got an idea for how
0.94%:  totally just got an idea for the
0.61%:  totally just got an idea for where
0.41%:  gotta find out where you
0.41%:  just wrote a theory about the
0.41%:  need to write that theory
0.41%:  forgot about the answer
0.41%:  would like to argue that you
0.41%:  think you just threw out a good
0.41%:  would be the first to call you a
0.41%:  would like to see that on the front
0.41%:  could totally be a science bro right
0.45%:  could totally be a science bro right now but
0.41%:  just talked about science with you for a
0.41%:  reject this out of hand but you
0.41%:  think you just got a science award!!
0.41%:  used to think there
0.41%:  totally forgot about outer
0.41%:  really should know better than to argue science out
0.41%:  hate to be the one to burst our
0.84%:  hate to be the one to burst our dark
0.41%:  just thought of a bullet
0.41%:  like your face better
0.41%:  think we just had our science fact
0.41%:  would like to start a club for that
0.41%:  would like that to be the future science
0.41%:  think you just blew all of our other
0.55%:  think you just blew all of our other science
0.41%:  just figured out how to beat all other science ner
0.41%:  should write a science theory
1.54%:  should write a science theory book!!
0.61%:  should write a science theory book about
0.48%:  should write a science theory about
0.41%:  was looking at
0.41%:  think you just brought all of science a
0.41%:  forgot about that theory in
0.41%:  could totally be wrong here but
0.41%:  just called you out for being the one
0.41%:  just won the science race for
0.46%:  just won the science race for the
0.42%:  just won the science race for real
0.41%:  feel like you just turned what
0.41%:  could write a science book that theory
0.41%:  totally just heard science talking!!
0.41%:  think we just agreed that science
0.41%:  just found a giant
0.41%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to a science
0.41%:  would like to be not
0.41%:  need to talk to those
0.41%:  think our science teacher just got blown
0.42%:  think our science teacher just got blown out
0.41%:  just found the only logical
0.41%:  need to talk to the science bros!!
0.41%:  just wrote a science book you
0.41%:  would just like to note that for a
0.41%:  think we should go to science
0.41%:  hate it when you talk science around
0.41%:  could be wrong about a lot of the science there!!
0.41%:  like the sound of both
0.41%:  could be wrong about the science but if there
0.41%:  think you just got owned
0.41%:  think you need to focus
0.41%:  think you just cleared science for
0.41%:  just got hit by a truck and
0.41%:  just figured out the whole science content
0.41%:  hate to break it to you but science has long
0.41%:  could write books about that guy
0.41%:  could be wrong about all the science so
2.20%:  could be wrong about all the science so far!!
0.68%:  could be wrong about all the science so far but
0.41%:  feel like you just won the science!!
0.41%:  would hate that
0.41%:  refuse to allow that to be the
0.41%:  thought it could only be one of
0.41%:  think just
0.50%:  think just about
0.41%:  won
0.41%:  sure would like to be a
0.41%:  sure would like to be a fly
2.98%:  sure would like to be a fly on that
0.41%:  went through all of science to deb
0.66%:  went through all of science to debunk your
0.41%:  should totally go back to the
1.74%:  should totally go back to the future
0.41%:  just got another science theory
0.41%:  just figured out how to be the only science bro
0.41%:  need to figure out how to re
0.41%:  would hate to be the first guy
0.41%:  think you just forgot to turn
0.41%:  just think you
0.41%:  think science just found a real
0.41%:  forgot all about what
0.41%:  should really write a book that
0.41%:  think you just got out
0.41%:  would hug you for this
0.41%:  thought you were still a science
0.46%:  thought you were still a science bro
0.41%:  forgot that you were secret
0.41%:  totally just broke the whole
0.85%:  totally just broke the whole science
0.44%:  totally just broke the whole science of
0.41%:  think you just brought forward science
0.41%:  just figured out a way to be the cool
0.41%:  would like that to be the case but no
0.41%:  need to talk to that guy for
0.92%:  need to talk to that guy for a while
1.31%:  need to talk to that guy for a while!!
0.84%:  need to talk to that guy for hours
0.53%:  need to talk to that guy for hours!!
0.47%:  need to talk to that guy for science
0.41%:  should totally write a bunch
22.66%:  should totally write a bunch of science
0.41%:  think you just rewrote all science bro
0.41%:  like your science better than actual
0.41%:  should totally write a book on science that
0.41%:  think science just got cooler for about
0.79%:  think science just got cooler for about three
0.41%:  really should get to know the
0.47%:  really should get to know the science
0.41%:  think we found the real source
0.41%:  feel like you thought about
0.41%:  could totally go for science
0.44%:  could totally go for science that
0.41%:  think you just caught one of
0.41%:  thought you were a science fan but
0.40%:  just figured out how to teach science to really
0.40%:  should totally write a science book for re
0.40%:  totally just thought of a new science and
0.40%:  just got turned on to a science theory!!
0.40%:  forgot to look under that
0.40%:  just got science fact and
0.40%:  forgot to thank the
0.40%:  could be wrong about all the science here but it
0.40%:  could totally be wrong about science after
0.40%:  just got burned by the
0.52%:  just got burned by the science
0.40%:  feel like you should get a science
0.40%:  hate to burst your science balloon but the
0.40%:  just thought of a way our science
0.40%:  want to hug you for that
0.40%:  could be the first guy to know the nature

0.40%:  think our science teacher just told
0.40%:  should write a science lecture book that only
0.40%:  think you just turned that
0.40%:  hate to break this to future
1.12%:  hate to break this to future science

0.40%:  think we both just found a
0.40%:  just need to figure out how to let
0.40%:  just figured out that 
0.40%:  should really write a book of counter
0.40%:  could be wrong about the science of reality

0.40%:  forgot to tell you about what
0.63%:  forgot to tell you about what dark
0.40%:  totally just got hit
0.40%:  just figured out the science to one

0.40%:  just fell down the rabbit hole about
0.40%:  forgot to say that there
0.40%:  really need to figure out how to shr
0.40%:  could write a blog
6.14%:  could write a blog about that!!
0.56%:  could write a blog about that theory
0.56%:  could write a blog about that theory!!
0.40%:  feel like that last
0.40%:  thought you were a dark
0.40%:  just broke science for you
0.40%:  hate to break it to you science world but
0.40%:  just went through all of science and it
0.40%:  think you just lowered the bar for all science to be

0.40%:  just wrote an entire science book that
0.40%:  could be wrong about any of these other
0.40%:  really want to be right about there
0.40%:  think we just brought science too
0.70%:  think we just brought science too far
0.40%:  feel like you could be
0.68%:  feel like you could be onto
0.40%:  just wrote a science article and got
0.40%:  just got turned on by a science bro
0.40%:  really should watch
0.40%:  wrote a story about that before
0.40%:  wrote a story about that before!!
0.40%:  could be wrong about that little
0.40%:  just figured out how to beat all the science!!
0.40%:  need to think about why
0.40%:  could not think
3.48%:  could not think of a better theory

0.40%:  always forget about outer
0.40%:  could be wrong about it all!!
0.40%:  cannot tell whether you are j
0.40%:  just need to figure out how to balance
0.40%:  need to figure out what that joke
0.40%:  just wrote a science fact book in
0.40%:  think you just got too real there for
0.40%:  think you just got real real science
0.40%:  clearly need to figure out how to talk about science!!
0.40%:  think you just went all
1.06%:  think you just went all science
0.40%:  could totally see that working for an
0.40%:  think we all just found out a lot
0.40%:  need to figure out how to roll that
0.40%:  hate you for taking that
0.40%:  really need to go back to the start
0.40%:  just got an idea for science but
0.40%:  could be wrong about all the other tiny
0.40%:  just think of that
0.40%:  think science just won the battle
1.10%:  think science just won the battle for
0.57%:  think science just won the battle for our
0.40%:  just need to figure out what other
0.40%:  think you just got the science reward
0.40%:  just figured out all the science on the
0.40%:  just got talked out of an
0.40%:  should write a blog entry about that for
1.14%:  should write a blog entry about that for science
0.40%:  forget how you
0.40%:  should write that book before science
0.40%:  just got all the way to the dark
0.40%:  totally blew
0.40%:  just totally figured out what 
0.40%:  could be right for
0.40%:  just walked into the cool
0.40%:  just thought of it and you all
0.40%:  hate to break this to science but you
0.40%:  just thought of a new better
0.40%:  think you just rolled
0.40%:  totally should write fan
0.40%:  created
0.40%:  just thought of a science article about
0.40%:  will take that theory to science and
0.40%:  need science to figure out what colour that
0.40%:  just blew all our science right out of the back end!!
0.40%:  just thought of a killer science lecture!!
0.40%:  think we all just created the
0.40%:  just found out where the
0.40%:  should write a book about the totally
0.40%:  just called you out for talking science when there
0.40%:  think science just got real for all
0.40%:  just got an idea for a book where science
0.40%:  was totally right about one of
0.40%:  totally just forgot how to science
0.40%:  forgot about our
0.40%:  just talked about science on
0.40%:  really thought about not
0.40%:  just got all the way to the end of a science book
0.40%:  think you just found the error
0.40%:  should get a science job
0.40%:  should write a science fact book real
0.40%:  just figured out that there are only 
0.40%:  really just wrote a
0.65%:  really just wrote a book
0.68%:  really just wrote a book about
0.60%:  really just wrote a science
1.02%:  really just wrote a science book
0.52%:  really just wrote a science article
0.40%:  just got turned on by the science!!
0.40%:  hate you for knowing that just
0.40%:  clearly need to look into that
2.11%:  clearly need to look into that further
3.08%:  clearly need to look into that further!!

0.42%:  need to go think about the future!!
0.40%:  should get out there
0.40%:  think you just created a fourth
0.40%:  just got turned into a science theory
0.57%:  just got turned into a science theory!!
0.40%:  just wrote an entire book of science thought
0.40%:  need to tell you about the black
0.40%:  could totally get into science for
0.40%:  need to go back to the library real
0.40%:  really should know better than to science
0.40%:  just thought about a really cool new
0.88%:  just thought about a really cool new science
0.40%:  just got a new theory about the science
1.26%:  just got a new theory about the science of dark
0.40%:  bet that would
0.40%:  should go to science
0.40%:  can just feel science
0.40%:  should get a science book written before
0.40%:  should really get back into science now
0.40%:  thought you were like science
0.40%:  just got hit by a science truck of

0.40%:  forgot about the counter
0.40%:  just wrote a doctor
0.40%:  hate to break this to you gentle
0.40%:  could be wrong about this one science theory
0.40%:  just blew all the science right out of dark
0.40%:  think you just blew the actual
1.40%:  think you just blew the actual science
0.75%:  think you just blew the actual science of
0.40%:  forgot you could hear us
0.40%:  just wrote a book about science

0.40%:  just got blown out of the air by
0.74%:  just got blown out of the air by science
0.40%:  should look into that science
0.40%:  could totally be a science writer for one
0.40%:  just got an idea for how to cure
0.40%:  should tell you that before
0.40%:  think you just rewrote the central
0.40%:  reject that theory for now
0.40%:  think we just created the science for
0.41%:  think we just created the science for our
0.40%:  knew this
0.40%:  like you!!
0.40%:  totally just forgot how science
0.40%:  could be wrong about the science this
0.40%:  feel like science just won the day
0.68%:  feel like science just won the day!!
0.40%:  should write a letter to science for

0.40%:  think we found a better
1.18%:  think we found a better theory
0.40%:  would be the first to laugh
0.78%:  would be the first to laugh at you
0.41%:  would be the first to laugh at your
0.40%:  just figured out another way to tell science
0.40%:  could write that story!!
0.40%:  found out
0.88%:  found out about
0.43%:  found out about this
1.09%:  found out about this theory
0.40%:  always thought it could be broken
0.40%:  just wrote a science article before
0.40%:  just found out where all the black
0.40%:  just thought of an entire world
0.40%:  think we could all just
0.93%:  think we could all just agree
1.10%:  think we could all just agree that science
1.00%:  think we could all just agree to
0.43%:  think we could all just agree that you
0.40%:  just thought of a new science career to try

0.40%:  cannot tell if you just blew
0.40%:  forgot to include the answer
0.40%:  thought you were back
0.40%:  think we just found all science
0.40%:  just figured out how to cheat at science by
0.40%:  really just wanted to figure out a
0.40%:  would shake
0.40%:  would be the first science blog
0.40%:  just figured out the role that
0.40%:  think we all just found the science to
0.47%:  think we all just found the science to our
0.40%:  figured out where all
0.40%:  thought you went
0.88%:  thought you went to science
0.40%:  just got idea for a new theory!!
0.40%:  forgot to ask whether
0.40%:  forgot to count that in
0.40%:  totally forgot about how the

0.40%:  just walked into a theory
0.40%:  forgot to answer the other
0.40%:  would argue that you are the
0.47%:  would argue that you are the first
0.40%:  think you just blew both of our science
0.40%:  just got a new theory for the science book
0.40%:  could write a science book about the theory
0.40%:  think you just got the science down
0.40%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but they
0.40%:  want to hug you but
0.40%:  call that the
0.40%:  would really hate
1.34%:  would really hate to be right
0.48%:  would really hate to be the
0.42%:  would really hate for
56.12%:  would really hate for that to be true!!
0.54%:  would really hate for that to turn
0.47%:  would really hate for that to be science
0.42%:  would really hate to be the first
0.40%:  hate to sound like a science
4.27%:  hate to sound like a science bro but
1.00%:  hate to sound like a science bro but that
0.75%:  hate to sound like a science bro but holy
0.43%:  hate to sound like a science bro here

0.40%:  think you just got all the science award for
0.40%:  think you just blew the science door
0.40%:  forgot about this dark
0.40%:  could be totally wrong about their fake
0.40%:  could be wrong about this theory about
0.40%:  think you just got all of science to blow
0.40%:  totally stole that idea!!
0.40%:  just created a theory of science in
0.40%:  should totally go to the
1.13%:  should totally go to the science
2.17%:  should totally go to the science fair
1.39%:  should totally go to the science fair!!
0.76%:  should totally go to the science centre
0.62%:  should totally go to the science center
0.40%:  just thought of a way science could be a better
0.40%:  just thought of a way science could be real bro
0.40%:  refuse to look into that theory
0.64%:  refuse to look into that theory!!
0.40%:  think you just touched on a science
0.40%:  think our science teacher just totally
0.90%:  think our science teacher just totally blew
0.40%:  feel like science just brought down
1.05%:  feel like science just brought down the cur
0.44%:  feel like science just brought down another
0.40%:  totally know that
0.40%:  just took down the
2.62%:  just took down the entire science
0.45%:  just took down the entire theory
0.40%:  just blew all our science out the door!!
0.40%:  need to figure out how to track the
0.40%:  just got turned on by science fr
0.40%:  just got a science boner without
0.40%:  would buy this
0.40%:  think you just rewrote the science for an
0.40%:  see your logic
0.40%:  just totally figured out black
0.40%:  would totally get a
0.40%:  feel like that would count as a
0.40%:  think you just created our science
0.40%:  could totally be right about just
0.40%:  just won the science lottery for a
0.40%:  totally just broke down the entire
0.60%:  totally just broke down the entire science
0.40%:  hate to break this to you but science would
0.40%:  just figured out all the other science too
0.40%:  just figured out how to back
0.40%:  think that could just be our new science
0.40%:  just figured out that all the cool
1.18%:  just figured out that all the cool science
0.40%:  should write that science fan
0.40%:  thought you liked science facts about
0.40%:  could talk about science for another twenty
0.40%:  was about to call you the
0.40%:  just figured out what there
0.40%:  need to go think about how true
0.40%:  do not care for that
2.01%:  do not care for that theory!!
0.40%:  just blew your science right out the fr
0.40%:  really just figured out that the
0.40%:  just broke science today
0.40%:  just figured out how to be the real
0.40%:  would totally go to that science
0.40%:  feel like that could just be what
0.40%:  was born to fight
0.40%:  kinda just thought of a new
0.40%:  kinda just thought of a new science
0.40%:  need to go to the library just
0.40%:  would like to enter that theory for
0.88%:  would like to enter that theory for science
0.40%:  can feel your
0.39%:  forgot about that one but
0.39%:  really thought we talked about science on
0.39%:  could be wrong about this but really
0.39%:  just blew your entire science out of the back door!!
0.39%:  really need to go work
0.65%:  really need to go work on that
0.43%:  really need to go work on that science
0.39%:  refuse to allow science to ruin
0.39%:  like you so
0.39%:  feel like we could both
0.39%:  just blew all our science right out the back of beyond!!
0.39%:  just got hit by a science fr
0.39%:  would not rule this
1.06%:  would not rule this out!!
0.56%:  would not rule this out for
0.39%:  really need to figure out how to burn that
0.39%:  just broke down the science of the
0.39%:  could totally be wrong about freak
0.39%:  just got talked out of a really
0.39%:  just broke through to science fact
0.39%:  totally need to watch
0.39%:  think you just threw out science fact
0.39%:  think you just won the science lecture gold
0.39%:  could be wrong about all the rest of it!!
0.39%:  should totally be the one to write
1.32%:  should totally be the one to write science
0.39%:  was about to call your
0.39%:  need to talk to the authors
0.39%:  think you just changed science for all our better
0.39%:  just thought of an un
0.39%:  think you just laughed at science!!
0.39%:  would like for that to be true about
0.39%:  just walked into another
0.39%:  think you just found two
0.39%:  think you just altered the face
0.39%:  was like totally gonna
0.39%:  think science just got really real for one
0.39%:  think science just got called
1.11%:  think science just got called out for
0.42%:  think science just got called out for not
0.39%:  could totally use that!!

0.39%:  just got an idea for how to rule
0.63%:  just got an idea for how to rule out the
0.39%:  think we should totally go science
0.39%:  should totally go into science for
1.51%:  should totally go into science for a career
3.87%:  should totally go into science for a career!!
0.39%:  think we both just learned
0.66%:  think we both just learned about
2.80%:  think we both just learned about science
1.77%:  think we both just learned about science!!
0.77%:  think we both just learned about science for
0.39%:  really do think that
0.39%:  just figured out where all the k
0.39%:  really need to figure out how to obsc
0.39%:  forgot you were around
0.39%:  feel like that could just be your
0.39%:  think you just changed real science for a better
0.39%:  just got a bunch of science written
0.39%:  just got a theory of
0.39%:  need to go work on science
0.39%:  could talk about these for
0.39%:  really just wanted to argue for the
0.39%:  think you just got too real for all
0.39%:  need to start working for a
2.50%:  need to start working for a science
0.39%:  could talk about science theory until
0.39%:  hate to break it to you ch
0.39%:  dun
0.39%:  think we just created science theory for
0.39%:  just thought of a new science book deal!!
0.39%:  would like to say that for once
0.39%:  thought you read
1.57%:  thought you read science
3.25%:  thought you read science books
0.87%:  thought you read science books for

0.39%:  think you were just called
0.43%:  think you were just called out
0.62%:  think you were just called out for science
0.39%:  thought you cared about science so
0.39%:  just figured out how to be a really cool
0.90%:  just figured out how to be a really cool science
0.39%:  thought it was a joke but
0.39%:  figured out the secret science
0.39%:  just thought of a way it could be real science
0.67%:  just thought of a way it could be real science!!
0.39%:  hate to be the judge
4.06%:  hate to be the judge of science
3.84%:  hate to be the judge of science but
0.54%:  hate to be the judge of science but you
0.39%:  just forgot how to be certain about science!!
0.39%:  really forgot about the whole science
0.39%:  think we all just heard science get
0.39%:  think you just brought down science for real!!
0.39%:  could be wrong about all of this science but
0.39%:  thought you worked in a
0.55%:  thought you worked in a science
0.56%:  thought you worked in a science lab
0.39%:  totally just deb
0.39%:  think the science just got all
0.39%:  forgot all about the other dark
0.39%:  should write a book about the only current
0.39%:  clearly need to write a book about science through
0.39%:  just figured out how to balance science
0.39%:  should write science f
0.39%:  hate you all right
1.67%:  hate you all right now!!
0.39%:  think you just earned a hug
0.39%:  can tell
1.48%:  can tell you right
3.30%:  can tell you right now that dark
1.12%:  can tell you right now that science
0.80%:  can tell you right now there
0.56%:  can tell you one
0.42%:  can tell you this
0.50%:  can tell you this for
0.39%:  think you just changed out
0.42%:  think you just changed out of science
0.39%:  found the one
0.39%:  just figured out why all the science bro
0.39%:  just figured out how to not be the
0.39%:  just figured out the content
0.39%:  like the sound of that ut
0.39%:  just figured out how to eat all the cake
0.39%:  clearly need to work on the
0.97%:  clearly need to work on the science
0.46%:  clearly need to work on the science of
0.39%:  feel like we just thought our
0.39%:  think we need to go to
0.39%:  just got a whole bunch of science to
0.39%:  forgot that science could be real!!
0.39%:  totally forgot about the science we
0.39%:  could be totally wrong about the science here just for
0.39%:  think you just won the science at
0.39%:  feel like we should go to
0.39%:  feel like you just re
0.39%:  think you just rewrote the science for a
0.39%:  just got a new theory before
0.39%:  hate to be the one to burst your bal
0.39%:  think you just blew science out the roof!!
0.39%:  think you just robbed science of the central
0.39%:  think you just got a real
0.39%:  just got a science boner for once
0.39%:  really should know better than to out
0.39%:  think you just caught a science
0.39%:  think you just forgot science and
0.39%:  just totally figured out where the black
0.39%:  could be wrong about the entire science of all
0.39%:  just figured out where all the bat
0.39%:  totally forgot about the science rules
0.39%:  would like to argue that science just
0.39%:  need to figure out how to reach out
0.39%:  should talk to the
0.74%:  should talk to the science
0.39%:  just figured out how all science can be bo
0.39%:  thought about it for a sec
0.44%:  thought about it for a sec but
0.39%:  could be the first one to know
0.74%:  could be the first one to know about
0.39%:  think you just got that one
0.70%:  think you just got that one for
0.39%:  could be wrong about a lot of these science
0.39%:  hate to tell you what science
0.39%:  feel like you just cut
0.39%:  think science just found out how to get really
0.39%:  already forgot what the
0.39%:  think you were just born to tell
0.39%:  need to go think of
0.39%:  really ought to think about science before
0.39%:  think you just won the debate for our
0.39%:  just got a new idea for lunch
0.39%:  thought you were science bros before
0.44%:  thought you were science bros before but
0.39%:  think you just rewrote the end
1.48%:  think you just rewrote the end of science
0.57%:  think you just rewrote the end of science!!
0.39%:  just figured out how to clean the
0.39%:  need to think about you
0.51%:  need to think about you for
0.39%:  should be the one calling
0.69%:  should be the one calling you fake
1.64%:  should be the one calling you fake bro
0.82%:  should be the one calling you fake!!
0.39%:  need to figure out how you
0.39%:  feel like that should be a science
0.39%:  think you just drew
0.39%:  really should work on being better at science fact
0.39%:  figured that one out on
0.39%:  think you should get on
0.39%:  really need to talk about how science
0.39%:  need to get to the science books
1.28%:  need to get to the science books library
0.39%:  just figured out two
0.39%:  think we all just found the true science
0.39%:  think you just agreed that science
0.39%:  think you just rewrote the science of large
0.39%:  think science just got really real for about two
0.39%:  think you just cr
0.39%:  totally forgot we had to
0.39%:  could totally be the first science author
0.39%:  just wrote a science fact book about
0.39%:  just blew all the science out of dark
0.39%:  just got called out by the freak
0.39%:  just feel
1.71%:  just feel like that
2.51%:  just feel like that would
0.55%:  just feel like that theory
1.02%:  just feel like that theory would
0.53%:  just feel like that theory could
0.51%:  just feel like that would be a
0.51%:  just feel like that would be too
0.50%:  just feel like you
0.42%:  just feel like you could
0.39%:  figured out the true
0.39%:  need to write that on
0.72%:  need to write that on a black
0.39%:  totally just figured out the cool
0.39%:  just figured out the three
0.39%:  just figured out how to take all the science ner
0.39%:  think you just forgot the science
0.39%:  feel like science just won that
2.42%:  feel like science just won that round!!
0.39%:  just legit
0.39%:  just killed science fact
0.39%:  think you just got the science award before
0.39%:  need to go to the library for a science
0.39%:  totally forgot there could be an
0.56%:  totally forgot there could be an answer
0.39%:  think we just learned about our
0.39%:  just got a science theory that
0.39%:  just figured out how to create the only
0.39%:  just got the idea for a science book where
0.39%:  can feel the science world shaking
0.39%:  just got another science idea
0.90%:  just got another science idea!!
0.39%:  think you just brought forward one
0.39%:  think about that too
0.39%:  hate to tell you this bro
0.39%:  think we should totally go after science
0.39%:  need to write a book of all
0.39%:  just created the theory of all science
0.39%:  really think that could be our answer!!
0.39%:  just created an
0.39%:  thought you were just t
0.39%:  thought you were full
0.39%:  need to figure out how to rule
0.39%:  finally get
0.39%:  kinda forgot about that when
0.39%:  just talked about science too
0.39%:  should totally win the science for
0.39%:  really could use
0.39%:  would rather not talk
1.03%:  would rather not talk about science
0.76%:  would rather not talk about science right
0.72%:  would rather not talk about this!!
0.69%:  would rather not talk about the
0.70%:  would rather not talk about the science
0.44%:  would rather not talk about science for
0.70%:  would rather not talk about science for the
0.39%:  always figured the
0.39%:  should get to work on that science career
0.39%:  think you just created our science for
0.39%:  would like to note that your science
0.39%:  just found the weak
0.39%:  do not know about the science but clearly
0.39%:  wonder if there are any books
0.39%:  feel like that should get
0.39%:  clearly need to write a book on science!!
0.39%:  could write that science book
0.41%:  could write that science book after
0.39%:  was looking for science
0.39%:  think you just created the science to
0.39%:  like the sound of that science bro
0.39%:  just noticed that you were
0.39%:  forgot you were in
0.40%:  forgot you were in the science
0.91%:  forgot you were in the science club
0.60%:  forgot you were in the science club!!
0.39%:  just got hit by a truck of science and now there
0.39%:  really need to focus on science
0.39%:  thought about it and now
0.39%:  used to think you were cool for
0.39%:  should totally get on that!!
0.39%:  could be wrong about that other
0.39%:  think you just changed all of science to a
0.50%:  think you just changed all of science to a better
0.39%:  think you just further
0.39%:  just got a new theory of science that
0.39%:  could write a book about science but
0.39%:  need to get back to science for
1.87%:  need to get back to science for a while!!
0.39%:  should get back to you on that one after
0.39%:  forgot to rule out all these
0.39%:  feel a
0.65%:  feel a little
0.39%:  just wrote a science book that could be
0.39%:  would legit
0.39%:  just figured out where all the blank
0.39%:  refuse to think about what you
0.39%:  need to hear
0.39%:  thought you said before
0.39%:  should write a book about science counter

0.39%:  just talked about science for ten
1.07%:  just talked about science for ten whole
0.39%:  think you just rewrote all of science to get
1.25%:  think you just rewrote all of science to get around
0.39%:  would like that to be a real
0.77%:  would like that to be a real theory
0.56%:  would like that to be a real theory!!

0.39%:  think we found our best theory about science
0.39%:  just called you a giant!!
0.39%:  just figured out how to clear all
0.39%:  would like the science
0.39%:  told you science was great
0.39%:  could be wrong about the rest of science by
0.39%:  should write a book about that for re
0.39%:  just thought of an ultra
0.39%:  should really get back into science for
0.39%:  thought you were still around to
0.39%:  would be lying
0.39%:  just got hit by another truck

0.38%:  could not be further
0.43%:  could not be further away
0.38%:  want that to be true so bad you
0.38%:  think you just blew science out of another
0.38%:  thought you cared about real science for
0.38%:  could be totally right but
0.38%:  should totally be the one working
0.38%:  just thought of a really nice science
0.38%:  just looked at
0.41%:  just looked at the night

0.38%:  feel like that could turn
1.54%:  feel like that could turn out to be wrong
0.53%:  feel like that could turn out to be a
0.38%:  could be looking at the future

0.38%:  like the sound of your breath
0.38%:  just got turned into the
0.38%:  just got an idea for where science
0.38%:  need to go think about all the science for
0.38%:  was born to argue
0.38%:  think you just created science where
0.38%:  just totally thought of a new idea
0.38%:  gotta be
1.75%:  gotta be honest with

0.59%:  gotta be honest with you bro
0.38%:  just thought of a related
0.38%:  would just like to note that he
0.38%:  just found the science
0.38%:  think you just changed science for bro
0.38%:  thought you were on our
1.19%:  thought you were on our side!!

0.64%:  bet you could get a job with
0.38%:  forgot about the black holes in outer
0.38%:  need to figure out a way to turn
0.38%:  just blew your entire science cred
0.38%:  need to go write a science book real
0.38%:  forgot to be
0.38%:  do not know about science but clearly
0.38%:  totally forgot that when
0.38%:  would like to be there for that science!!
0.38%:  just figured out how all the cool
1.06%:  just figured out how all the cool science
0.38%:  need to go back to the library for all
4.95%:  need to go back to the library for all the science
0.38%:  feel like that just brought science to
0.38%:  could be wrong about this but the science of
0.38%:  think you just need to get
0.38%:  just figured out what science theory to
0.38%:  would like to hang out there for a sec
0.38%:  just figured that out all
0.38%:  just thought of a way to take science
0.38%:  forgot that science was real
0.38%:  just need to figure out how to corner
0.38%:  hate to break it to you but science doesn
0.38%:  think you just got the real science of
0.38%:  thought you were a science den
0.38%:  think you just con
0.38%:  think science just got away
0.38%:  need to talk to you later when
0.38%:  think we just bought
0.38%:  think you were just born to be a science doctor
0.38%:  just got called out on a science theory!!
0.38%:  really should get to the science
0.38%:  just got a new science theory about the
0.38%:  should really get a better
0.58%:  should really get a better science
0.90%:  should really get a better science book
0.38%:  really ought to write those
0.38%:  could be wrong about all the rest of science that
0.38%:  just figured out how they all
0.38%:  could be wrong about the science but for the rest
0.38%:  think you just got our science teacher
0.38%:  thought science was done!!
0.38%:  could be right about all the non
0.38%:  think we should tell science to forget
1.85%:  think we should tell science to forget about
0.38%:  just thought of a way science could re
0.38%:  should write a book about all the science but
0.38%:  just got idea for a new science theory
0.38%:  think you just changed all our f
0.38%:  think we just found the cut
0.38%:  would like to argue that such
0.38%:  just got all the way to science

0.38%:  really should get into science!!
0.38%:  think you just beat the science of
0.38%:  just got hit by the science bullet and now
0.38%:  thought you liked science now
0.38%:  just blew your science out of orbit
0.38%:  really just thought of an
0.38%:  could be right about the rest of your
0.38%:  think science just got real real
0.38%:  thought you were sound
0.38%:  just found the truth
0.38%:  would like to see the science that conf
0.38%:  do not know about these science
0.38%:  should be working on that!!
0.38%:  think you just fr
0.38%:  just got all the science on
1.14%:  just got all the science on dark
0.38%:  forgot all about how science
0.38%:  legit
0.43%:  legit just
0.38%:  think you just got the word
0.38%:  just blew all your science out the door!!
0.38%:  need to get back to your

0.38%:  thought we could talk about real science before
0.38%:  figured that out too
0.38%:  think you were just born to do
6.06%:  think you were just born to do science
1.22%:  think you were just born to do science!!
0.43%:  think you were just born to do science for
0.61%:  think you were just born to do science for the
0.38%:  think science just found a better
0.47%:  think science just found a better theory
0.38%:  feel like science just got away
0.38%:  totally just thought of science like
0.38%:  think you just rewrote all of science and bought
0.38%:  thought you were into science fact
0.38%:  just created the theory for
0.38%:  just got all the science for you
0.38%:  just found out there are two other
0.38%:  feel like they
0.81%:  feel like they just
0.74%:  feel like they should
0.41%:  feel like they could
0.38%:  just got an idea what
0.38%:  need to figure out how to steal science
0.38%:  just got all the way to science before
0.38%:  think we just changed science bro!!
0.38%:  totally just broke through science to
0.38%:  could totally go for a science where
0.38%:  should get a science book written about all
0.38%:  just need to figure out how to alter
0.38%:  think you were just born to be the science
0.38%:  can think of about a
0.38%:  need to go back to the library to answer

0.38%:  just broke the fourth wall on
0.42%:  just broke the fourth wall on you
0.38%:  was born to be right
0.38%:  just got a new theory to think
0.38%:  should write a science book about counter
0.38%:  think you just got science done
0.38%:  think we both just found out science
0.38%:  think we need to get
0.38%:  think we just found science to argue
0.38%:  was totally doing
0.70%:  was totally doing science
0.50%:  was totally doing science before
0.47%:  was totally doing science there
1.52%:  was totally doing science there for
1.18%:  was totally doing science there!!
0.38%:  like the sound of science better
0.38%:  think you just robbed all the fun
0.38%:  could be right about the rest of science
0.38%:  would kill for that to be the reason
0.38%:  refuse to be the
0.38%:  just blew all our dark
0.38%:  think you just rewrote science fact to be
0.38%:  think you just rewrote science and got
0.38%:  think you just brought science on board for
0.38%:  hate to be the one to kill your fun but
0.38%:  just felt a chill down
0.38%:  need to get back on science

0.38%:  feel like you just brought science too hard at
0.38%:  just broke through science to reality!!
0.38%:  could be totally wrong about the rest of science in
0.38%:  should write a book about un
0.38%:  think you just won the global science race!!
0.38%:  just burned
0.38%:  just called out the
0.38%:  need to get out of this town
0.52%:  need to get out of this town!!
0.38%:  really should know about science better than
0.38%:  would kill for that theory!!
0.38%:  need to get back to you when
0.38%:  forgot that science could totally
0.53%:  forgot that science could totally be
0.38%:  really wrote this
0.38%:  would argue that science has
0.38%:  thought you were out for dinner
0.38%:  just think about you
0.38%:  think you need to start
0.38%:  need to get back to the library so
0.38%:  need you to shut

1.30%:  need to get to science school
0.45%:  need to get to science school!!
0.38%:  just created a theory for how
0.38%:  feel like science just got a whole bunch d
0.38%:  thought of it too
0.38%:  totally forgot we could use the science
0.38%:  forgot about the real reason
0.38%:  forgot about the one where
0.38%:  could be wrong about science for the literal
0.38%:  really need to learn about science though!!
0.38%:  would like that theory to be real so
0.38%:  really need to go out
0.38%:  think you just rewrote the science of gal
0.38%:  want to be that
0.77%:  want to be that guy!!
0.38%:  totally forgot about the second law
0.38%:  would totally be in
0.38%:  should be angry that
0.38%:  just got science on the
0.72%:  just got science on the brain
0.55%:  just got science on the brain!!
0.38%:  just figured out a really cool
0.56%:  just figured out a really cool science
0.38%:  think that could be our new best
0.38%:  would like that to be true for real
0.38%:  would rather you not think
0.38%:  need to get back to this theory!!
0.38%:  was born to figure out the true
0.38%:  choose to ignore your
0.38%:  think you just found a science where
0.38%:  just figured out a whole other
0.38%:  think you just got a hold
0.38%:  need to work on that article
0.38%:  should be the one calling you fake bro!!
0.38%:  really think we could be
1.38%:  really think we could be onto
0.38%:  would like to share that
0.38%:  think you just got blown out
0.58%:  think you just got blown out of the science
0.38%:  should really write that science book one
0.38%:  want to be a
0.39%:  want to be a science
0.47%:  want to be a science teacher
0.41%:  want to be a science guy
0.38%:  think you just created the new science!!
0.38%:  need to science that right away
0.37%:  just thought of a killer way to end
0.37%:  forgot that was the
0.37%:  just got turned on by science for a while
4.23%:  just got turned on by science for a while there!!
0.37%:  could write a science book but
0.37%:  forgot to tell you the dark
0.37%:  only just
4.93%:  only just now thought

0.36%:  would say there
0.36%:  just figured out how to talk science really
0.36%:  need to get to the library to look
0.36%:  could be talking about science to
0.36%:  could be wrong about all of science but the
0.36%:  just found out what the real
0.36%:  just told you how
0.36%:  cannot allow this theory to be
0.45%:  cannot allow this theory to be true
1.10%:  cannot allow this theory to be true!!
0.36%:  could be wrong about the science for one
0.36%:  just got science hard on your

0.36%:  think you just der
0.36%:  just found out we
0.36%:  should tell you what
0.36%:  could totally win science
0.36%:  just figured out another one!!

0.36%:  totally just figured out science on
0.36%:  was right there!!
0.36%:  hate to be that guy but science would
0.36%:  refuse to think about that longer
0.36%:  think we just got science for
0.90%:  think we just got science for real
0.36%:  would totally go for this science
0.36%:  feel like that would be too
0.36%:  just got burned by a
0.73%:  just got burned by a science
1.41%:  just got burned by a science fact
0.61%:  just got burned by a science fact!!

0.36%:  totally just got an idea for how science
0.36%:  was totally right about the bro
0.36%:  think we can safely
0.36%:  totally just figured out how to earn science
0.36%:  refuse to be wrong on
0.36%:  totally think we
1.26%:  totally think we should go
0.65%:  totally think we just
0.71%:  totally think we just found

0.40%:  totally think we should be
0.36%:  think you need to be careful how
0.36%:  think that would be a great
0.36%:  should write a book about the science f
0.36%:  totally just thought of a science word!!
0.36%:  only just figured that out too
0.36%:  would like to hear the science
0.36%:  bet you think that
1.02%:  bet you think that because

0.35%:  totally just broke science for real though
0.35%:  think you should be science fact
0.35%:  think we just changed science for real real!!
0.35%:  used to think your science
0.35%:  forgot about black holes in outer
0.35%:  totally just broke down the science of giant
0.35%:  should totally write a book about science fr
0.35%:  think you just rewrote the god
0.35%:  should go to the science lecture
0.35%:  think you just found science all
0.35%:  need to talk to the science bros right

0.35%:  forgot about that but now you
0.35%:  was totally right before and

0.35%:  really need to think about other
0.35%:  should write all
0.35%:  think you just learned about science there!!
0.35%:  just created a new theory of science tonight
0.35%:  would like to say the
0.35%:  really should take that science
0.35%:  just got totally science fact
0.35%:  just got blown out of the air by science!!
0.35%:  just figured out what al
0.35%:  could swear
0.35%:  told you there were no

0.35%:  can totally do
0.35%:  forgot all about the secret
0.35%:  forgot about that silly
0.35%:  think you just blew science out of the barn
1.12%:  think you just blew science out of the barn door
0.43%:  think you just blew science out of the barn door!!
0.35%:  clearly need to write about
0.35%:  totally forgot we had a
0.35%:  would totally bet on that being
1.12%:  would totally bet on that being fake
0.67%:  would totally bet on that being fake!!
0.35%:  see through your science trick
0.35%:  really should get better at science!!
0.35%:  can totally see that!!
0.35%:  like your new
0.35%:  should be talking to you about what
0.35%:  could totally be wrong for the rest
0.35%:  just called out the entire
0.88%:  just called out the entire science
0.38%:  just called out the entire science of
0.35%:  feel like you just wrote a science blog
0.35%:  just figured out where the al
0.35%:  just got a new theory before lunch
0.35%:  think you just won that debate for science
0.42%:  think you just won that debate for science!!
0.35%:  totally figured out how science
0.35%:  think the answer to our
0.35%:  forgot about the weird
0.42%:  forgot about the weird science
0.35%:  could write a science story that
0.35%:  could really see
0.82%:  could really see that
9.39%:  could really see that working
10.28%:  could really see that working out
10.80%:  could really see that working out for

0.70%:  could really see that working out for both
1.86%:  could really see that working out for both science
0.65%:  could really see that working for science!!
0.51%:  could really see that being
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science of it
1.25%:  could be wrong about the science of it all but
0.42%:  could be wrong about the science of it but
0.35%:  just got better at science for real!!
0.35%:  hate that you just took all
0.35%:  thought about it before but now
0.35%:  feel like you just brought the science to an
0.35%:  would just like to note that our
0.35%:  always forget to thank the
0.36%:  always forget to thank the science
0.35%:  just blew all the science out of you
0.35%:  really need to figure out science!!
0.35%:  think we just found science a
0.35%:  would eat
0.37%:  would eat that
0.98%:  would eat that theory
1.26%:  would eat that theory for
0.35%:  think we just got a theory of science!!
0.35%:  need to talk to you for a sec
0.35%:  should write a science blog about that one
1.06%:  should write a science blog about that one!!
0.35%:  gotta think on
0.85%:  gotta think on that for
0.35%:  could talk about nothing else but science
0.35%:  could see that theory
4.99%:  could see that theory working
3.99%:  could see that theory working out
1.79%:  could see that theory working out for
1.75%:  could see that theory working!!
1.54%:  could see that theory working for
1.09%:  could see that theory working out!!
0.72%:  could see that theory working for about
0.47%:  could see that theory working out for science
0.40%:  could see that theory being
0.35%:  totally forgot the answer could be science!!
0.35%:  could be wrong about little
0.35%:  just thought about a science idea
0.35%:  would hate to think of
0.35%:  do not like how that
0.35%:  think you just changed science two
0.35%:  would totally forget about science because
0.35%:  think science just got rad
0.35%:  hate to burst the
0.35%:  could be wrong about all these other f
0.35%:  need to get to work!!
0.35%:  just got all the credit for a
0.45%:  just got all the credit for a theory
0.40%:  just got all the credit for a science
1.57%:  just got all the credit for a science break
1.02%:  just got all the credit for a science theory
0.39%:  just got all the credit for a science theory!!
0.35%:  just wrote that book!!
0.35%:  forgot that was the current
0.35%:  think the science just got really real for about
0.35%:  think you just altered the current
0.35%:  will take that theory under close
0.35%:  just thought of a way to trick all
0.35%:  think you just got too real for science and
0.35%:  just need to figure out how that rel
0.35%:  really want to go back to before
0.35%:  could totally be a science writer one
0.35%:  just called you an
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science in that joke!!
0.35%:  told you there was nothing to talk
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science after all you
0.35%:  need to talk to all the science bros!!
0.35%:  could be totally wrong about this for re
0.35%:  think for once you just blew
0.35%:  think we just found out all there
0.35%:  feel like that should be your science
0.35%:  really wanted to get
0.35%:  think you just wrote a science fact!!
0.35%:  thought your
0.35%:  just figured out what all the science talk on
0.35%:  just thought of a really cool new dark
0.35%:  just got science harder on
0.82%:  just got science harder on you!!
0.35%:  feel like that could be just
0.56%:  feel like that could be just about
0.35%:  would like that to be the case for science but
0.35%:  totally forgot about this week
0.35%:  thought about you before
0.35%:  just figured out how to t
0.35%:  forgot you were such an
0.35%:  just won the science lottery there
0.35%:  used to think you were an
0.35%:  should totally write a book one
0.35%:  just thought of it all at once and
0.35%:  thought you were for a
3.66%:  thought you were for a second!!
2.00%:  thought you were for a second but
0.85%:  thought you were for a second but no
0.35%:  just figured out a way to be both the
0.35%:  just blew all your science out of the back door
0.35%:  could be right about one other
0.35%:  just thought of a science book to read
0.54%:  just thought of a science book to read!!
0.35%:  think you were just about to change all science for
0.35%:  could be totally wrong about the fate
0.35%:  think you just rewrote all of the science to
0.35%:  would like that to be the only reason
0.35%:  think you just wrote that for science
0.35%:  totally just figured out how to enhance
0.35%:  thought you were black
0.35%:  could be talking to the future science star
0.35%:  just thought of a w
2.69%:  just thought of a wacky science
0.85%:  just thought of a wacky science idea
0.85%:  just thought of a wacky science idea!!
0.57%:  just thought of a wicked
0.35%:  just thought of a new article!!
0.35%:  just got blown back
0.45%:  just got blown back into
12.48%:  just got blown back into the future
8.67%:  just got blown back into the future!!
3.90%:  just got blown back into the future by
4.09%:  just got blown back into the future by science
1.84%:  just got blown back into the future by science!!
1.18%:  just got blown back into the future by a
1.37%:  just got blown back into the future by a science
0.38%:  just got blown back into the future by all
0.35%:  need to go to the library to search
0.35%:  hate to be the guy to break science
0.35%:  just watched you
0.35%:  forgot about that lo
0.35%:  do not care for your thought
0.35%:  would like that theory to be fact
0.35%:  think science just told
0.35%:  should write a science book before that
0.40%:  should write a science book before that guy
0.35%:  really should write a book of science that
0.35%:  could talk about science for hours right
0.35%:  just blew all your science cred
0.35%:  reject that theory for no good
0.35%:  just got called out for science by a non
0.35%:  just got science factual
0.35%:  should write a science book but before
0.35%:  should write a book about science but all
0.35%:  really thought we talked about science too
0.35%:  totally forgot that science is real!!
0.35%:  need to figure out how to cr
0.35%:  just threw out a science theory for once
0.35%:  just figured out who all
0.51%:  just figured out who all the real
0.38%:  just figured out who all the cool
0.35%:  would like that last
0.35%:  feel like you just brought science to the land
0.35%:  think you just threw out one
0.35%:  should write a book about all the funny science
0.35%:  just figured out how to control all science
0.35%:  just got hit by another science truck
0.35%:  just thought of it now and
0.35%:  would still argue that that
0.35%:  figured out the answer to the science
0.35%:  thought you were just a fake bro
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science here but all
0.35%:  should write a book about utterly
0.35%:  really should get that
0.35%:  forgot that there are still
0.35%:  would like for that to not
0.66%:  would like for that to not be the
1.19%:  would like for that to not be the case!!
0.45%:  would like for that to not be science
0.40%:  would like for that to not be true!!
0.35%:  thought you were for real until
0.35%:  really just figured that one out on
0.35%:  could be wrong about this but all
0.35%:  should really know better than to be
0.35%:  thought you knew science!!
0.35%:  just won the science lottery for certain
0.51%:  just won the science lottery for certain!!
0.35%:  just ruined science for you all
0.35%:  just figured out what nearly
0.35%:  like the sound of all that but
0.35%:  would say the
0.35%:  think you just rewrote the fate
0.35%:  bet you thought science was cool
0.41%:  bet you thought science was cool before
0.56%:  bet you thought science was cool before but
0.35%:  thought about it once
0.35%:  think you just rewrote both
2.69%:  think you just rewrote both science
0.80%:  think you just rewrote both science and our
0.35%:  just got the science bon
0.35%:  just got the science boner of
0.35%:  just blew your science right out of here
0.35%:  could be the first guy on
0.35%:  think science just got way cooler real
0.35%:  think we just learned about the science
0.37%:  think we just learned about the science of our
0.35%:  just thought of it now but clearly
0.35%:  just created a theory of light
0.35%:  think you just double
0.35%:  forgot to tell you about when
0.35%:  can feel the science working
0.35%:  think you just blew all of our science and
0.35%:  thought you were about to talk
0.47%:  thought you were about to talk science
0.35%:  just got science on you!!
0.35%:  just totally thought of science!!
0.35%:  think he just called you
0.35%:  just thought of a way to not be called
0.35%:  just forgot to include all
0.93%:  just forgot to include all the science
0.77%:  just forgot to include all the other
0.35%:  need to know right
0.35%:  would totally hang out there if
0.35%:  totally forgot we could use that
0.35%:  think you just changed all our science bro
0.35%:  just wrote a science theory that
0.87%:  just wrote a science theory that could
0.47%:  just wrote a science theory that could be real
0.62%:  just wrote a science theory that could be real!!
0.35%:  always thought if
0.35%:  think the world just got cooler for
0.35%:  just broke through into science
0.35%:  thought you were a science doctor!!
0.35%:  think you just got two
0.40%:  think you just got two science
0.35%:  could be wrong about entire
0.35%:  want to go to the library!!
0.35%:  thought science was about to reject
0.35%:  think you were born just for
0.76%:  think you were born just for that
0.35%:  forgot how to talk
0.35%:  just thought of your entire science
0.35%:  do not like to be wrong but that
0.35%:  forgot about the last theory
0.62%:  forgot about the last theory!!
0.35%:  just fell down the rabbit hole back to science!!
0.35%:  just figured out that they are
0.35%:  think you just blew enough
0.62%:  think you just blew enough science
0.54%:  think you just blew enough science to
0.37%:  think you just blew enough science for
0.36%:  think you just blew enough science for all
0.35%:  think you just got science factual
0.35%:  clearly need to write a science book on
0.35%:  like your cut
0.76%:  like your cut of the science
0.84%:  like your cut of the science dollars
0.35%:  think you just rewrote all our science to be
0.35%:  just created a theory for science to
0.35%:  need to write that book so
0.35%:  thought we could talk about science for one
0.35%:  think you just changed our science for re
0.35%:  just called you out for taking
0.67%:  just called you out for taking science
0.35%:  just talked about science for a whole ten
0.35%:  just heard a great science
0.60%:  just heard a great science theory
0.57%:  just heard a great science theory!!
0.35%:  would just like to be clear on
0.35%:  could be wrong about that but only
0.35%:  reject that theory for now but
0.35%:  forgot about that in
0.35%:  cannot tell you how jealous
0.35%:  just got all the science cred
0.35%:  totally just figured out how to be black
0.35%:  like how you left
0.35%:  feel like science just got thrown
0.44%:  feel like science just got thrown out
0.35%:  think you just blew science out the fr
0.35%:  just blew your science right out of the balloon!!
0.35%:  just thought of a way science could be eternal
0.35%:  really need to write that book about
0.58%:  really need to write that book about science
0.35%:  just found the giant
0.35%:  just forgot to include the whole
0.35%:  thought you were too old
0.35%:  think science just got really cool for about a
0.35%:  feel really good about that joke now
0.77%:  feel really good about that joke now!!
0.35%:  think we just got to the core of our
0.35%:  think you just got that one for real
0.51%:  think you just got that one for real!!
0.35%:  really need to think about how to react
0.35%:  thought of a better joke but
0.36%:  thought of a better joke but now
0.35%:  feel like science just got cool and
0.35%:  think we just got real science done
0.35%:  need to get back to science so
0.35%:  clearly forgot to think
0.73%:  clearly forgot to think about the
0.64%:  clearly forgot to think about the science
0.35%:  need to go talk about this theory
0.35%:  could be wrong about the science but that is really
0.35%:  just took your
0.39%:  just took your idea
0.35%:  thought you were just called
0.35%:  could be looking at the answer
0.35%:  forgot you could turn
0.54%:  forgot you could turn science
0.36%:  forgot you could turn science into a
0.35%:  think you just rewrote all of science and are
0.35%:  think you need to follow
0.35%:  could talk about that science
0.35%:  need to buy stock in that
0.35%:  think you just robbed science of the one
0.35%:  could write a book that theory
0.35%:  would like to be there for that!!
0.35%:  just figured out how to be really cool at science!!
0.35%:  thought you were bad at science just
0.36%:  thought you were bad at science just before
0.35%:  totally forgot about the science rules!!
0.35%:  really should know about that!!
0.35%:  forgot you were such a science bro until
0.35%:  really think we ought
0.35%:  just talked about the science of light
0.35%:  just fell into
1.01%:  just fell into a black
0.35%:  hate to be the one to burst all your black
0.35%:  like the sound of that about
0.35%:  should write the book on
0.35%:  think you just called science wrong
0.35%:  could totally be wrong about this but science
0.35%:  really should write a book for science
0.35%:  just figured out how science can be totally broken
0.35%:  really should take the
0.35%:  just blew all the science out of your entire
0.35%:  only just now thought about it
0.35%:  think for the rest
0.35%:  could be totally right for
0.35%:  could totally be a science genius for
0.35%:  was looking for that theory
0.35%:  just got hit by a black
1.41%:  just got hit by a black hole of
4.18%:  just got hit by a black hole of science
1.64%:  just got hit by a black hole of science!!
1.34%:  just got hit by a black hole!!
0.54%:  just got hit by a black hole of science and
0.35%:  think you just ate all
0.43%:  think you just ate all the science
0.35%:  just figured out where all the corn
0.34%:  really should get to work on a
0.46%:  really should get to work on a science
0.34%:  just told you all
0.42%:  just told you all about
0.34%:  would rather not think about your
0.34%:  just need to know if there
0.34%:  think you just rewrote the science bro
0.34%:  just got fr
0.34%:  think you just won all the debate
0.73%:  think you just won all the debate tour
0.34%:  would like to lecture
0.34%:  really ought to be careful
1.22%:  really ought to be careful about
0.44%:  really ought to be careful about who
0.42%:  really ought to be careful about how
0.40%:  really ought to be careful around
0.34%:  should totally write science book about
0.34%:  used to think they were all
0.34%:  thought you were under control
0.34%:  just figured out all the science too
0.34%:  just got better at science bro
0.34%:  could talk about other
2.02%:  could talk about other things but
2.01%:  could talk about other things for
0.87%:  could talk about other things too
0.60%:  could talk about other things too!!
0.47%:  could talk about other things now
0.34%:  forgot to call the
0.34%:  think our science just got really cool!!
0.34%:  swear to god if they
0.34%:  should go to the science centre for
0.34%:  would think about that but science
0.34%:  need to talk to this guy for real
0.34%:  could be wrong about all of the science but at
0.34%:  can totally get on board with these science
0.56%:  can totally get on board with these science bro
0.34%:  need to go tell the
0.66%:  need to go tell the science
0.34%:  should write a science book but there
0.34%:  forgot about the three
0.34%:  forgot about all this other science junk
0.34%:  need to talk to this fellow about
0.34%:  thought you were te
0.34%:  just called you fake without
0.34%:  think you just touched science!!
0.34%:  wrote a letter
0.55%:  wrote a letter to science
0.45%:  wrote a letter to the science
0.34%:  just figured out how to call the science
0.34%:  refuse to look at
0.39%:  refuse to look at the
1.30%:  refuse to look at the science
2.41%:  refuse to look at the science behind
1.98%:  refuse to look at the science behind your
0.38%:  refuse to look at that
0.34%:  like that better than regular old
0.34%:  just won the science battle for all
0.34%:  always thought it could be true
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science but at this
0.34%:  think we just found a career
0.34%:  think science just found a whole
0.34%:  just thought of a way to call
0.34%:  should go to the science centre!!
0.34%:  think you just brought all science down to a
0.34%:  would like to start a science club about
0.34%:  totally just won science for like
0.44%:  totally just won science for like the
0.34%:  think science just got a lot harder
0.34%:  should really work on better
0.34%:  think you just ner
0.34%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole a
0.34%:  killed the
0.37%:  killed the theory
0.34%:  feel like you just watched a science
0.34%:  think you just found the role
0.34%:  think you just forced a
0.34%:  need to figure out how to be science
0.34%:  just thought about science and it blew
0.34%:  just got all the science to
0.54%:  just got all the science to back
0.34%:  think you just wrote one
1.02%:  think you just wrote one of the great
22.82%:  think you just wrote one of the great science
0.34%:  just threw out a bunch of giant
0.63%:  just threw out a bunch of giant science
0.34%:  just got called out by a science bro with
0.34%:  could write a science book on that one
0.34%:  would kill for that to be true because science
0.34%:  refuse to argue
1.41%:  refuse to argue with that
1.35%:  refuse to argue with that!!
0.66%:  refuse to argue with you
0.65%:  refuse to argue with science
0.34%:  just got all the way out here to find
0.34%:  hate you for letting
0.34%:  just thought of science and it blew
0.34%:  would like to say to
0.37%:  would like to say to that
0.34%:  do not know about this future
0.34%:  think we found our theory to
0.34%:  can totally hear
0.34%:  would like to say that no
0.34%:  just talked about science with other
0.34%:  really should write a book before
0.34%:  really thought about it for a second but no
0.34%:  forgot that you could just
0.34%:  would totally go to the science fair just
0.34%:  just figured out where black hole
0.34%:  could totally see that working for other
0.44%:  could totally see that working for other science
0.34%:  could be talking about real science for re
0.34%:  need to talk about this theory!!
0.34%:  think you just created a lo
0.34%:  just broke down crying there
0.34%:  think we could all agree that you
2.42%:  think we could all agree that you just
0.34%:  just figured out a way to re
0.34%:  think you just won the science race for a
0.34%:  think you just got science for real!!
0.34%:  just got a science boner for you!!
0.34%:  just need to figure out what all
0.34%:  could be wrong about the only science
0.34%:  should totally be working on the
1.08%:  should totally be working on the science
0.44%:  should totally be working on the science of
0.34%:  should go write about that on
0.34%:  refuse to call
0.38%:  refuse to call that
0.55%:  refuse to call that theory
0.34%:  can neither
0.34%:  could write science books!!
0.34%:  think you just created real science that
0.34%:  think you just got called out for a
0.34%:  could be wrong about this one science theory!!
0.34%:  thought you cared about science as well!!
0.34%:  feel like that would count as science rather
0.34%:  need to figure out how to sc
0.34%:  think you just wrote a science blog that could
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science for the rest
0.34%:  just got a new science fact
0.34%:  would hug you so
0.34%:  thought you were a friend to science just
0.34%:  just thought of a new board
0.34%:  should buy a ticket for that lot
0.34%:  used to think they were cool
0.34%:  would like for you to be
0.34%:  just got burned by science fact
0.34%:  should write a letter to the science blog
0.34%:  thought you were science for
2.73%:  thought you were science for a second!!
1.00%:  thought you were science for a second but
0.34%:  really need to write that book soon
0.96%:  really need to write that book soon!!
0.34%:  could write a science book for that one
0.34%:  just talked about science with you both
0.34%:  feel like you just brought an
0.34%:  do not like where your
0.34%:  need to call you right after
0.34%:  just got really into science after
0.34%:  think you just brought all of science down cr
0.34%:  really should know better about
0.34%:  think you just found the 
0.34%:  need to go work on this
0.44%:  need to go work on this theory!!
0.34%:  could totally be on the wrong
0.34%:  think you just won the global science race for
0.34%:  forgot there was a science
0.34%:  totally forgot that science doesn
0.34%:  would like to hang out there for science
0.34%:  just forgot to breathe while you
0.34%:  think you just touched on a great

0.34%:  need to write a science book that only
0.34%:  totally just figured out the hole
0.34%:  really screwed that
0.34%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to the core
0.34%:  should write a letter to the science club!!
0.34%:  forgot to rule out black holes in
0.34%:  should go to the science library!!
0.34%:  just killed science theory!!
0.34%:  just blew all your science right out of the back end!!
0.34%:  can just hear the science world
0.34%:  should write that book for science!!
0.34%:  just got a new theory for science about the
0.34%:  could write a science book just to tell you
0.34%:  think you just rewrote all of science once
0.34%:  think you just changed science for real bro!!
0.34%:  just went back through all
0.34%:  totally just figured out where the al
0.34%:  really need to figure out how that just
0.34%:  should write a science fact book on
0.34%:  can think of a better word to
0.34%:  think we found a science
0.43%:  think we found a science theory
0.34%:  could be wrong about only
0.34%:  just blew science out of the god
0.34%:  should write a science book but about
0.34%:  really need to figure out how to sh
0.34%:  just thought of a cool new idea
0.34%:  totally just figured out how to be a hero
0.53%:  totally just figured out how to be a hero!!
0.34%:  forgot to close
0.34%:  need to call science right away to
0.34%:  really should know about that but
0.34%:  just got all the way here
0.34%:  just got all the way here for
0.34%:  forgot to include that they
0.34%:  just thought of a way science can be done
0.34%:  hate to break it to you world
0.34%:  should totally be working for the science centre!!
0.34%:  need to tell you that
0.34%:  just thought of a really neat book

0.54%:  think you found the worst science
0.34%:  thought you were a friend to science too
0.45%:  thought you were a friend to science too!!
0.34%:  thought for sure science would be better
0.34%:  can see how
0.34%:  could totally write a book on these
0.34%:  really need to look that
0.34%:  feel like you just brought science to bear on that and
0.34%:  could be wrong about all that other science
0.34%:  think that would count as science!!

0.34%:  really just wanted to be right for a
0.34%:  just thought of a brand new science book you
0.34%:  just got talked into a theory of science!!
0.34%:  really ought to write a book about these
0.34%:  really need to figure out how to lock that
0.34%:  just figured out how to be totally real
0.34%:  can totally get on board with both
0.34%:  forgot to allow
0.34%:  could really see that working out for the science!!
0.34%:  feel like you just brought science to a whole not

0.34%:  just thought of a new race
0.34%:  would like to return to the subject of angry
0.34%:  like you too
0.34%:  could talk about the science of these
0.34%:  think you just won the battle of science bro
0.34%:  like how you just turned the
0.34%:  just got owned by science for once
0.34%:  just wrote a book on that called
0.34%:  thought science was all about not
0.34%:  thought of a better counter
0.34%:  should write a book about the science content
0.34%:  just got all science theory
0.34%:  thought about it for way
0.34%:  could talk about science for years without
0.34%:  was looking at the
0.34%:  wrote a science book for
0.54%:  wrote a science book for adults
0.36%:  wrote a science book for adults!!
0.34%:  forgot about science and reality!!

0.34%:  think you just got all of science!!
0.34%:  cannot wait for science books
0.34%:  just wrote an article for the science blog and
0.34%:  feel like you just went through a door to
0.34%:  thought you were all about science facts not
0.34%:  just called you out on the
0.34%:  feel like you just got the science award
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science this one
0.34%:  could be wrong about the science for this
0.36%:  could be wrong about the science for this one!!
0.34%:  feel like you just won a
0.86%:  feel like you just won a science
0.34%:  refuse to allow science to cloud
0.34%:  just figured out all at
2.82%:  just figured out all at once how
2.05%:  just figured out all at once what science
1.92%:  just figured out all at once why
1.75%:  just figured out all at once how science
1.56%:  just figured out all at once how to
1.30%:  just figured out all at once that
1.05%:  just figured out all at once how the
0.89%:  just figured out all at once why there
0.82%:  just figured out all at once what the
0.81%:  just figured out all at once why science
0.78%:  just figured out all at once the
0.66%:  just figured out all at once what both
0.88%:  just figured out all at once what both science
0.63%:  just figured out all at once where
0.58%:  just figured out all at once how to be
0.54%:  just figured out all at once that science
0.46%:  just figured out all at once why the
0.43%:  just figured out all at once how both
1.10%:  just figured out all at once how both science
0.35%:  just figured out all at once how to be both
0.34%:  hate it when science turns out to be all
0.34%:  totally just figured out how to hack
1.67%:  totally just figured out how to hack science
0.34%:  like how you just brought science fact
0.34%:  forgot to rule that out already
0.47%:  forgot to rule that out already!!
0.34%:  just blew all our dark energy
0.34%:  think we just got another
0.34%:  think we just found our science blog
0.34%:  could be wrong about another theory!!
0.34%:  need to figure out how to lose track
0.34%:  totally need to figure out how to crash
0.41%:  totally need to figure out how to crash science
0.34%:  think science just got totally blown
0.34%:  just got burned by science for once
0.34%:  really need to figure out how to burn science
0.34%:  hate to break the news but your science
0.34%:  would rate
7.79%:  would rate that theory
1.27%:  would rate that theory a
1.10%:  would rate that theory about
0.95%:  would rate that theory as
0.81%:  would rate that theory 
0.53%:  would rate that theory of
0.49%:  would rate that theory of science
0.47%:  would rate that theory at
0.45%:  would rate this
0.43%:  would rate this theory about
0.40%:  would rate this theory a
0.34%:  would rate this theory at
0.34%:  think you just won the science argue!!
0.34%:  just killed science by
0.34%:  would kill to be
0.62%:  would kill to be that
0.34%:  really should get back on that
0.34%:  do not want to hear your science talk
1.38%:  do not want to hear your science talk right
0.34%:  should write a blog entry about that before
0.34%:  like how that totally
0.34%:  could be the one
1.38%:  could be the one to finally
0.53%:  could be the one who
0.42%:  could be the one who figures
0.39%:  could be the one who finally
0.34%:  just thought of real science and it
0.34%:  forgot all about that weird
1.22%:  forgot all about that weird theory
0.84%:  forgot all about that weird theory!!
0.34%:  could be working on the science of the year
0.50%:  could be working on the science of the year!!
0.34%:  think the science just got too real for once
0.34%:  just figured out that only
0.34%:  gotta think about where
0.34%:  should really get into science!!
0.34%:  could be wrong about all the science after this
0.34%:  just killed a
2.56%:  just killed a theory
3.08%:  just killed a theory about
2.51%:  just killed a theory that
2.50%:  just killed a theory about the nature
1.88%:  just killed a theory of
4.10%:  just killed a theory of science
2.32%:  just killed a theory of science!!
1.27%:  just killed a theory of the
1.14%:  just killed a theory of science that
0.57%:  just killed a theory that science
0.41%:  just killed a theory before
0.39%:  just killed a theory about what
0.37%:  just killed a theory for
1.55%:  just killed a theory for science
1.08%:  just killed a theory for science!!
0.34%:  should be working on that science
0.34%:  thought you were still around to talk
0.44%:  thought you were still around to talk science
0.34%:  should be the one talking to
0.34%:  cannot tell you how big
0.34%:  just wrote an entire book for science called
0.34%:  really gotta find
0.35%:  really gotta find out
0.44%:  really gotta find out who
0.34%:  could be wrong about all of the rest
0.34%:  just got called out by fr
0.34%:  thought science was totally fake
0.34%:  need to figure out how to tell black
0.34%:  just got that theory
0.34%:  could be right about so
0.34%:  really should be taking science
0.34%:  only just figured out what black
0.34%:  would like to hang out there!!
0.34%:  just got a new theory for science that could
0.34%:  thought you knew too
0.34%:  just got really into science for three
0.63%:  just got really into science for three whole
0.34%:  think our science just got way harder
0.34%:  bet you could write a book about these
0.34%:  totally just heard science being
0.34%:  could be wrong about all the science theory
0.34%:  like how you forgot
0.47%:  like how you forgot that
0.34%:  just forgot all about how
0.34%:  really got
0.34%:  think we better go
0.34%:  should totally write a book for science ge
0.34%:  think you just rewrote the global
1.51%:  think you just rewrote the global science
0.34%:  forgot about this but
0.34%:  really should get back to science!!
0.34%:  just broke through your defence
0.34%:  thought it was too
0.34%:  hate to be the one to burst your big
0.34%:  think you just created a real science for the
0.34%:  forgot about that because science!!
0.34%:  think you just got real there
0.34%:  could totally write a science book for the rest
0.34%:  was about to think
0.34%:  thought you were cute and all
0.34%:  hate to break it to you science bros but when
0.34%:  think you just blew science out of the great
0.34%:  just figured out what the only real
0.34%:  just wrote an entire book full
0.34%:  should totally go to science con
0.34%:  forgot about the one where dark
0.34%:  think you just rewrote science bro
0.34%:  should write a book about you!!
0.34%:  feel like you just won a science battle
0.34%:  could go for a sn
0.34%:  think you better watch out for science
0.34%:  think these
0.34%:  should be talking to you about that
0.53%:  should be talking to you about that!!
0.34%:  reject that on grounds of it
0.34%:  used to think about
0.34%:  really do think about science too
0.34%:  think science just got way cooler and better
0.34%:  hate to be the one to burst your fuck
0.34%:  would take
6.01%:  would take that theory
2.35%:  would take that theory to
0.54%:  would take that theory to science
0.34%:  would take that theory out
0.34%:  would take that as
0.34%:  think you just won the global science debate club
0.34%:  would like to be your science teacher for just
0.34%:  refuse to be the only
0.34%:  should be talking about science not
0.34%:  could totally be wrong about science this
0.34%:  would rather be the
0.49%:  would rather be the first
0.34%:  just figured out how to tell anyone
0.34%:  really think we found
0.48%:  really think we found out
0.35%:  really think we found out about
0.34%:  feel like the world just got science
0.34%:  thought you cared about real science like
0.34%:  forgot how to think about science and
0.34%:  really need to work on that logic
0.34%:  totally just figured out how to break science once
0.34%:  think you just beat the science world!!
0.34%:  totally just got science on
0.34%:  totally forgot about our science
0.34%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole back
0.34%:  would totally go there for
0.36%:  would totally go there for that
0.34%:  feel like you just went through a ton
0.34%:  clearly need to talk about this further
0.34%:  just figured out how to be a rocket
0.34%:  would take that theory so
0.37%:  would take that theory so far
0.34%:  forgot that was your
0.34%:  just got thrown
0.41%:  just got thrown into
0.36%:  just got thrown into a black

0.92%:  just got thrown into a black hole of science by
0.53%:  just got thrown into a black hole by
0.40%:  just got thrown into a black hole by science

0.34%:  clearly need to figure out who
0.34%:  thought you just wanted to look
0.34%:  think you just blew all science out of the door
0.34%:  thought for certain dark
0.34%:  just need to figure out what black
0.34%:  just got an idea for a new science rock
0.34%:  could talk about the science of this but
0.34%:  think you just rewrote the rule
0.34%:  thought you were real for once
0.49%:  thought you were real for once!!
0.34%:  totally forgot about the nuclear

0.33%:  want to say
0.33%:  really should know that before
0.33%:  just thought of a new cool
0.46%:  just thought of a new cool science
0.33%:  just figured out how science can be real
0.33%:  think we just created a science theory to
0.33%:  think you should be able

0.71%:  think you should be able to get a science
0.44%:  think you should be able to get a job
0.33%:  think you were just about to change all of science bro
0.33%:  just thought about it before
0.33%:  think we need to call the

0.33%:  would like that to be on
0.33%:  totally just figured out how to hack science!!
0.33%:  think you just rewrote all of science better
0.33%:  totally just heard a science
0.33%:  would bet that
0.33%:  would buy that science right
0.33%:  want to go back to before
0.33%:  think we found our science career
0.33%:  thought science was all about deb
0.33%:  just thought of a new science book to be
0.33%:  just thought of really
0.33%:  forgot about that theory once
0.41%:  forgot about that theory once!!
0.33%:  could be wrong about any of the science!!
0.33%:  think we just found the science guy
0.33%:  clearly need to write a science book but
0.33%:  could totally write a song
0.33%:  just need to work
0.65%:  just need to work out
0.92%:  just need to work out the science
0.72%:  just need to work out the log

0.44%:  just need to work through
0.33%:  forgot to talk about the science!!
0.33%:  think you just allowed science to enter
0.33%:  need to write science books for young

0.33%:  just got an idea for a new science club
0.33%:  cannot wait for the day
0.52%:  cannot wait for the day science
0.33%:  think you just grew
0.33%:  just thought of dark anti
0.33%:  could see that working out for the
0.33%:  really ought to write that science
0.44%:  really ought to write that science book
0.33%:  better go tell
0.33%:  feel like you just brought the science!!
0.33%:  just figured out how to be the one
0.33%:  would just like to note that your science
0.33%:  do not like where you just
0.33%:  need to borrow your black light
0.33%:  just got the idea for a whole
0.33%:  should write that science book one
0.33%:  think you just won a science debate for all
0.33%:  would really hate that
0.33%:  just really want to be
0.33%:  reject that notion
0.33%:  hate to burst the dark
0.33%:  was born to figure out that theory
0.33%:  just thought of a better way science could be like
0.33%:  just blew your entire science out the door
0.46%:  just blew your entire science out the door!!
0.33%:  thought you were science but
0.33%:  could totally be right about the answer
0.33%:  think you just got harder
0.61%:  think you just got harder science
0.33%:  just thought of a way science could be real broken!!
0.33%:  just went through science and
0.33%:  just thought of a way to rec
0.33%:  just found out who
0.33%:  feel like you just went through science to
0.33%:  feel like that theory was
0.33%:  need to think about all the ways
0.33%:  could totally write a book about these!!
0.33%:  could write a book just about all the other
0.33%:  think you just threw out a good science
0.33%:  thought for sure science could
0.33%:  wrote a science article about
0.33%:  really just wrote out
0.33%:  just got really hard science
0.33%:  just thought of a way science could be in error!!
0.33%:  think you just forgot all about the science and
0.33%:  need to figure out how to turn the
0.33%:  feel like that could be an
0.33%:  just got called out for science by a three
0.33%:  really should write a book about science one
0.33%:  could be wrong about all the science for this
0.33%:  just figured out that not only are we
0.33%:  hate that you just called
0.33%:  reject that theory too!!
0.33%:  just thought of a way to earn science
0.40%:  just thought of a way to earn science cred
0.33%:  totally just forgot about science!!
0.33%:  just went through your
0.77%:  just went through your entire
0.33%:  think the science just got way
0.39%:  think the science just got way too
1.00%:  think the science just got way too real!!
0.39%:  think the science just got way too real for once
0.33%:  just thought of a way science can be ruined
0.33%:  just figured out how to talk to all
0.33%:  need to figure out science jokes
0.33%:  could be wrong about this science theory!!
0.33%:  just thought of a way real
0.33%:  forgot you could use science like
4.24%:  forgot you could use science like that!!

0.33%:  clearly need to write a science book that just
0.33%:  need to talk to a grown
0.33%:  forgot they could absorb
0.33%:  really need to figure out how to suck at
3.42%:  really need to figure out how to suck at science
0.33%:  could be wrong about all of science but at
0.33%:  should write a science book about energy
0.33%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole by
0.33%:  just wrote a really good science book that
0.33%:  could totally go for an
0.33%:  kinda forgot about that science
0.33%:  could be right about science
0.33%:  think we just created another
0.73%:  think we just created another science
0.41%:  think we just created another science for
0.33%:  used to think that you were cool but
0.33%:  feel like you just watched that
0.33%:  just need to figure out how to be a
0.33%:  just thought of it too and you

0.33%:  went to school for that
0.33%:  thought we could finally rest
0.33%:  just called you out for being a broken
0.33%:  could be wrong about all the science of the
0.33%:  would kill to see that science
0.33%:  could totally write a book for teens
0.33%:  really wrote that book before
0.33%:  should really work on being
2.27%:  should really work on being better
18.27%:  should really work on being better at science

0.33%:  thought you were all about reject
0.33%:  just thought of an ob
0.33%:  just thought of a way science could be real in
0.33%:  could be totally wrong about the science or
0.37%:  could be totally wrong about the science or the
0.33%:  would like to note that both
0.33%:  just thought of a tiny
0.33%:  need to write a science story for the
0.40%:  need to write a science story for the local
0.33%:  think that could be our last
0.33%:  just thought of a science book title and

0.33%:  think science just created a new theory
0.76%:  think science just created a new theory for
0.60%:  think science just created a new theory of
0.42%:  think science just created a new theory about
0.33%:  forgot about black holes and science
0.33%:  think you just changed science for our better!!
0.33%:  need to start talking science
0.33%:  should get to work on that before

0.33%:  would like that last theory
0.33%:  was about to be really
0.33%:  thought we could talk about science for a bit
0.33%:  forgot about all the non
0.33%:  could really use another
0.33%:  could be totally wrong about this but for
0.33%:  thought you were still a science bro!!

0.33%:  just figured out how that science
0.33%:  think you just got ahead
0.45%:  think you just got ahead of science
0.33%:  forgot there was science behind all
0.33%:  could be the first science guy to know
0.94%:  could be the first science guy to know about
0.33%:  could be the first science guy to know about the
0.33%:  could totally get in
0.41%:  could totally get in on that science

0.33%:  could totally be wrong about the science here but if
0.33%:  need to get science
0.33%:  feel the ground
0.33%:  feel the ground shake
0.33%:  would argue that yes
0.33%:  just got all science on you with dark
0.33%:  could be talking to future
1.07%:  could be talking to future science
0.33%:  would like to start a science blog
0.33%:  totally just ruined science for the both
0.33%:  watched
0.33%:  watched too
0.33%:  would like to be thought
0.33%:  just got the c
0.33%:  want to be a science teacher!!
0.33%:  would hate to be right
0.33%:  just figured out what the science on
0.33%:  need to write a science book just to tell
0.33%:  forgot to call the science
0.33%:  just got a science boner there for like
0.33%:  think you just changed science real
0.33%:  forgot to look that
0.33%:  really should know better about science

0.76%:  could write a book about that for science!!
0.33%:  could write a book about that for science ner
0.33%:  just need to figure out what science book
0.33%:  need to talk to you for science
0.32%:  really think we just found out there
0.32%:  would argue that if they
0.32%:  just thought of a line
0.32%:  totally forgot to take
0.32%:  think science just got a lot harder!!
0.32%:  need to think really
0.32%:  just figured out what color
0.32%:  just blew all our science right out of the boat
0.35%:  just blew all our science right out of the boat!!
0.32%:  do not know!!
0.32%:  would take that theory for
1.39%:  would take that theory for science
0.32%:  should write the science book
0.32%:  just got called out for a theory
0.32%:  just broke science today!!
0.32%:  just got an idea for what to be
0.32%:  really need to figure out how to block that science
0.32%:  should totally write a science book about there
0.32%:  totally need to get
0.52%:  totally need to get back
0.32%:  just thought of a new killer
0.59%:  just thought of a new killer science
0.32%:  would really rather not take
0.32%:  think science just got called out by a
0.32%:  do not want to hear further
0.32%:  just went through science to
0.32%:  just got science hard on your butt
0.32%:  totally need to work on science
0.32%:  totally forgot about the real science behind
0.32%:  think you just rewrote all of science at the
0.32%:  should totally write a book of science re
0.32%:  want that to be true enough
0.32%:  hate to break the news to you but our science
0.32%:  do not know about that!!
0.32%:  just now
1.46%:  just now thought
2.29%:  just now thought about
3.88%:  just now thought about dark
1.18%:  just now thought of a
1.42%:  just now thought of a better
1.10%:  just now thought of a counter
0.96%:  just now thought of dark
0.93%:  just now thought of a really
0.55%:  just now thought of a science
0.47%:  just now thought of a better science
0.45%:  just now figured
3.28%:  just now figured out that
1.15%:  just now figured out the
1.13%:  just now figured out that there
0.85%:  just now figured out that the
0.84%:  just now figured out that science
0.53%:  just now figured out the science
0.46%:  just now figured out that the only
0.37%:  just now noticed
0.39%:  just now noticed that you
0.35%:  just now thought of an
0.34%:  just now figured out that the science
0.34%:  just now figured out that all
0.32%:  totally got
0.32%:  think we just found out the great
0.32%:  could be right about all that
0.32%:  just blew science right out of the door
0.35%:  just blew science right out of the door!!
0.32%:  think we should be careful not to let our science go
0.32%:  think that was
0.32%:  told you science was boring!!
0.32%:  think we just found our global
0.32%:  think we should tell science to get
0.32%:  feel like that theory could go
0.32%:  really thought about it for a second but now
0.32%:  would argue that is not
0.32%:  should write a book of science counter
0.32%:  just totally figured out how to che
0.32%:  would be the first to call that
0.32%:  refuse to think about where
0.32%:  think you just changed science for about a
0.32%:  should get out of the science r
0.32%:  reject this theory for no good
0.32%:  hate that you just broke science
0.32%:  want to be your science
1.81%:  want to be your science teacher
0.86%:  want to be your science teacher!!
0.79%:  want to be your science friend!!
0.65%:  want to be your science teacher so
1.53%:  want to be your science teacher so bad!!
0.32%:  would like to note that for science
0.32%:  do not know about the science but this
0.32%:  just got all the science about
0.32%:  think you just found where science got all
0.32%:  gotta talk to you
0.32%:  think you just changed science all of
0.32%:  think you just found how
0.65%:  think you just found how to get
0.32%:  hate to tell you how
0.32%:  would totally not reject
0.32%:  should write a science blog for
0.32%:  was about to call the science
0.32%:  think you just won the debate club for all
0.32%:  refuse to allow that to be science!!
0.32%:  would not rule out this theory at
0.32%:  really think we should get out of our science
0.32%:  looked into that for
0.32%:  think you just lowered the bar for science about
0.32%:  think you just argued science for
0.39%:  think you just argued science for the
0.32%:  could be talking to the future best
0.76%:  could be talking to the future best science
0.32%:  really need to figure out how to shout
0.32%:  hate to break it to you but such
0.32%:  refuse to let that
0.32%:  think you just created a new science for our
0.32%:  could totally see the
0.32%:  need to tell science about you right
0.32%:  just got hit on
2.29%:  just got hit on by science
1.32%:  just got hit on by science!!
0.32%:  need to figure out how to counter
0.32%:  refuse to allow you
0.32%:  hate to break it for
0.52%:  hate to break it for you but
0.32%:  laughed at
0.36%:  laughed at your
0.61%:  laughed at your joke
0.83%:  laughed at your joke but
1.52%:  laughed at your joke but then
0.71%:  laughed at your joke but now
0.45%:  laughed at your joke but secret
0.35%:  laughed at your joke but then it
0.32%:  should totally write a science book for a bunch
0.32%:  hate to be that guy but wouldn
0.32%:  just figured out how all the non
0.32%:  should tell the
0.70%:  should tell the science
0.32%:  just broke the law
0.50%:  just broke the law of science
0.40%:  just broke the law of non
0.32%:  just broke the law of nature
0.32%:  just learned about the science of black
0.32%:  really think we should go out to
0.32%:  would be so totally
0.32%:  totally just thought of a word
0.32%:  really gotta start
0.32%:  just broke science and now the future
0.32%:  hate to be the one to bust your fr
0.32%:  would totally bet on that!!
0.32%:  thought you were just fant
0.32%:  hate to break it to you science bros but we
0.32%:  would buy tickets to the
0.32%:  need to talk to you through
0.32%:  could be totally right about science!!
0.32%:  think you just changed science for all our better!!
0.32%:  just talked about science for an entire hour
0.32%:  just got owned by a science article
0.32%:  clearly need to write a book of short
0.91%:  clearly need to write a book of short science
0.32%:  just blew your little dark
0.32%:  need to talk to you about science for a while
0.88%:  need to talk to you about science for a while!!
0.32%:  really thought it would be science
0.32%:  forgot about that and you just
2.18%:  forgot about that and you just blew
0.32%:  could totally see the science
0.39%:  could totally see the science working
0.32%:  totally just figured out the known
0.32%:  forgot about the science already
0.32%:  really just want to be done
0.32%:  need to call the science bro
0.96%:  need to call the science bros right
0.95%:  need to call the science bros right away
0.58%:  need to call the science bros about
0.32%:  think we all just learned a
0.32%:  just got hit by a bunch
6.93%:  just got hit by a bunch of science
3.86%:  just got hit by a bunch of science bul
0.69%:  just got hit by a bunch of science!!
0.48%:  just got hit by a bunch of science and
0.39%:  just got hit by a bunch of science bullet
0.38%:  just got hit by a bunch of science bull
0.35%:  just got hit by a bunch of science bro
0.32%:  think you just got real science real
0.32%:  could be wrong about a lot of shit but
0.32%:  just found out they
0.32%:  thought you were outside!!
0.32%:  think we all just agreed to be science
0.32%:  totally forgot to include a
0.32%:  need to go work on that theory real
0.32%:  totally just figured out the science we
0.32%:  like you better now that
0.32%:  forgot what the letter
0.32%:  could be talking about science after
0.32%:  just thought of a way science could be an
0.32%:  hate to burst your black
0.55%:  hate to burst your black hole but
0.32%:  think you just had better
0.72%:  think you just had better science
0.32%:  should totally write science book for
0.32%:  really just wanted to go for
0.32%:  hate to be the science
0.80%:  hate to be the science guy around
0.76%:  hate to be the science guy but
0.32%:  think you just rewrote all of science to argue
0.32%:  should totally go out for
0.32%:  forgot about the science rules!!
0.32%:  think you just argued better for
0.32%:  should totally write a science book before that
0.32%:  think the world just got an
0.32%:  could be wrong about all of the science history
0.32%:  swear to science
0.32%:  just wrote a science fact book and it
0.32%:  think you could get a science fellow
0.32%:  choose to ignore that!!
0.32%:  think you just got science the
0.32%:  just talked about science without once
0.32%:  just figured that out all on
0.32%:  would so
0.82%:  would so totally
0.32%:  think you just found a better science to
0.32%:  can totally get behind fake
0.38%:  can totally get behind fake bro
0.37%:  can totally get behind fake bros who
0.32%:  thought you were a robot
0.32%:  can feel it
0.32%:  forgot to take the
0.32%:  reject this theory on two front
0.32%:  feel like that just blew your
0.32%:  just heard a really
0.32%:  should write a fan
0.32%:  just looked at the science
0.32%:  could talk about this new
0.50%:  could talk about this new theory of
0.46%:  could talk about this new theory of science
0.32%:  should write that book one
0.32%:  think we just brought science fact one
0.32%:  sure would hate
0.55%:  sure would hate to be the
0.50%:  sure would hate to think
0.57%:  sure would hate to think about
0.42%:  sure would hate to be right
0.39%:  sure would hate to be the guy
0.32%:  sure would hate to be that
0.32%:  think science just changed for all
0.32%:  think you just earned science
0.32%:  forgot about the really
0.32%:  need to get to a
2.06%:  need to get to a library
0.81%:  need to get to a library!!
0.51%:  need to get to a black
1.04%:  need to get to a black hole
0.32%:  totally just wrote a science book and then
0.32%:  just talked about science for a long
0.32%:  think you just grabbed the crown of science!!
0.32%:  think they just got real!!
0.32%:  should totally write a freak
0.32%:  would like to reject that theory for science!!
0.32%:  just forgot what science
0.32%:  think you just got what
0.32%:  think you just won free
0.32%:  just thought of a way to control dark
0.32%:  really just wanted to be right about science
0.89%:  really just wanted to be right about science for
8.11%:  really just wanted to be right about science for once!!
0.32%:  could totally use that in a book
0.77%:  could totally use that in a book!!
0.32%:  should really get on that before
0.32%:  could really go for an
0.32%:  think you just found the la
0.32%:  bet you could write that on
0.32%:  can barely follow that but it
0.32%:  should totally write a book about the science f
0.32%:  would not be able to think
0.32%:  need to think about all the science for
0.32%:  could be wrong about all the other fant
0.32%:  think you just brought all of science on
0.32%:  refuse to think about that longer!!
0.32%:  just got a new theory on the
0.32%:  just thought of a way to be science bro
0.32%:  think you just blew science out of the clear
0.32%:  could totally be wrong about science but
0.32%:  just got called out by science ner
0.32%:  need to get back on the science bus!!
0.32%:  just figured out how to totally rock science!!
0.32%:  just got all the way out to
0.32%:  need to figure out how to let science
0.32%:  need to follow that theory
0.32%:  would argue that they still count
0.32%:  just think about science for
0.32%:  forgot to include all the science jokes
0.32%:  feel really good about the work
0.32%:  just figured out not only what the real
0.32%:  could write a book just for
1.17%:  could write a book just for that theory
0.82%:  could write a book just for that one
0.34%:  could write a book just for that!!
0.32%:  look forward to hearing that you
0.32%:  think you just wrote the end
1.94%:  think you just wrote the end of science
0.81%:  think you just wrote the end of science!!
0.32%:  need to go think about how science really
0.32%:  think you just got harder science bro
0.32%:  just thought of one way science
1.14%:  just thought of one way science could be real
0.67%:  just thought of one way science could be better
0.41%:  just thought of one way science could be real!!
0.32%:  just got tricked by science for
0.32%:  think you just changed all our science fore
0.32%:  just thought of a totally un
0.32%:  feel like you just brought another science
0.32%:  like that better than your old
0.32%:  just blew all your science right out the back and
0.32%:  just figured out what the real science break
0.32%:  look forward to this lecture
0.32%:  hate it when you talk to
0.32%:  think you just freed the
0.32%:  feel like the world just got a tr
0.32%:  forgot about all the other junk
0.46%:  forgot about all the other junk science
0.32%:  just got turned on by science talk about
0.32%:  just figured out all the real
1.22%:  just figured out all the real science
0.32%:  could talk about this for an
0.32%:  need to figure out how to take all
0.32%:  would argue that no
0.32%:  kind
1.91%:  kind of want
1.27%:  kind of want that
21.22%:  kind of want that to be true!!
3.06%:  kind of want that to be real

1.37%:  kind of really want that to be the
0.48%:  kind of really want to
0.47%:  kind of really want that to be true so
0.32%:  think you just learned how to argue for
0.32%:  should really get to work on that before
0.32%:  think you just brought science down a floor
0.32%:  think we should totally forget about our science
0.32%:  think you just entered science fact
0.32%:  reject this theory out of anger
0.32%:  totally just figured out real science on
0.45%:  totally just figured out real science on the back
0.32%:  could totally be working on that
0.32%:  should write a book about all the science bro
0.32%:  would rate that as
0.32%:  forgot that the science
0.32%:  just thought of a literal
0.32%:  really should write that science book!!
0.32%:  can totally get on board with future
2.39%:  can totally get on board with future science
0.33%:  can totally get on board with future science!!
0.32%:  could totally see that being true for
0.32%:  think you just heard science fall
0.32%:  could write a book just about the science of the
0.32%:  think you just won the science debate for our great

0.32%:  could be wrong about the last bit there
0.32%:  need to talk about how
0.32%:  gotta science

0.32%:  should write a grant
0.37%:  should write a grant for
0.68%:  should write a grant for that!!
0.32%:  should totally write that book one
0.32%:  forgot that you were a science bro and
0.32%:  forgot you could use that
0.32%:  should write a science f
0.32%:  know the
0.39%:  know the secret
0.59%:  know the secret of
0.32%:  gotta write that on
0.32%:  think science just found a way to get cool
0.32%:  think you just heard about
0.32%:  just blew all our science right outta the fr
0.32%:  just figured out how the science totally
0.32%:  better get
0.32%:  forgot about the nature

0.32%:  think you just got a lot
0.32%:  think that could be wrong
0.32%:  feel really good about this joke!!
0.32%:  thought you were an actual science bro for
0.32%:  could write a really

0.32%:  could be wrong about all this but for
0.49%:  could be wrong about all this but for the
0.32%:  refuse to be wrong today
0.32%:  forgot all about this week
0.32%:  really just thought about science for no

0.32%:  just totally figured out who
0.32%:  just totally thought of a science book
0.32%:  forgot there was actual science out
4.78%:  forgot there was actual science out there!!
0.32%:  could be wrong about the science of it all but there
0.32%:  think science just got real cool for
0.32%:  totally just broke science for the whole
0.32%:  just turned science into the cool
0.32%:  could be wrong about all the science there but
0.32%:  cannot breathe

0.32%:  think you need to get out of science
0.32%:  can think of better ways
0.32%:  just got an idea for your
0.32%:  would listen to that theory before
0.32%:  should write a science book for you!!
0.32%:  should get into
2.42%:  should get into science
0.59%:  should get into science!!
0.35%:  should get into science after
3.19%:  should get into science after all!!
0.32%:  should get into science before
0.32%:  thought you just wanted to call
0.32%:  forgot about that black hole under
0.32%:  need to tell you about science later
0.78%:  need to tell you about science later!!
0.32%:  just need to think
0.76%:  just need to think about how
0.32%:  really want that to be right so
0.32%:  feel like you just had to
0.32%:  gotta write that science book!!
0.32%:  should get back to you on that before science
0.32%:  could totally see the future
0.32%:  think we just got science hard
0.32%:  like that last
0.32%:  just blew all our dark energy science
0.32%:  just thought of a science counter
0.32%:  would like that to be the science of
0.32%:  forgot all about this theory but now
0.32%:  just freaked out about science!!
0.32%:  think you just blew science outta the fr
0.32%:  forgot about black holes in the
0.32%:  just figured out that one science theory!!
0.32%:  really want to go to the science fair
0.32%:  refuse to call dark
0.32%:  just blew all your science right out of that
0.32%:  hate you for telling
0.32%:  just figured out how there can be science
0.32%:  just wrote a theory of science
0.32%:  totally just won the science debate hour
0.32%:  just wrote a book and you
0.32%:  think you just wrote another science blog
0.32%:  already know enough about this!!
0.32%:  just need to figure out what they
0.32%:  feel like that would count as science but
0.32%:  should write a book of all the counter
0.32%:  should get to the science
0.33%:  should get to the science library
0.62%:  should get to the science library before
0.32%:  need to figure out how to buy science
0.32%:  need to go to the science club
0.32%:  look forward to the science grant that
0.32%:  think science just got harder for a
0.32%:  just learned about the science of light
0.32%:  totally just won the science race for the
0.32%:  just need to figure out how to block all
0.32%:  really should write a book one
0.32%:  just thought of a real world
0.32%:  could be wrong about any of this but that
0.32%:  really need to think about that science
0.32%:  should really know about science
0.97%:  should really know about science before
0.49%:  should really know about science better
0.32%:  just thought of a science too
0.32%:  should write a book about the science counter
0.32%:  look forward to turning these
0.32%:  hate you for knowing science that
0.32%:  would rate that theory a 
0.31%:  forgot to eat lunch earlier!!
0.31%:  think we all just found science to be a

0.37%:  think you are just about the
0.31%:  just got really into the whole science
0.31%:  just walked into a science lecture for
0.31%:  forgot the whole science
0.31%:  could be wrong about all other science!!
0.31%:  look forward to the article on
0.31%:  just got hit by a car!!
0.31%:  think you just allowed science to change our
0.31%:  think you just down
0.31%:  just think about science and
0.31%:  need to follow through
0.31%:  think you just got all our science for
0.31%:  cannot wait for dark

2.49%:  think you just blew all of science to the ground
1.52%:  think you just blew all of science to the ground!!
0.31%:  just thought of a way science could not be
0.31%:  already know enough about science to just be
0.31%:  forgot about that one until
0.31%:  feel like you just brought science to bear down
0.31%:  really should know about the current
0.59%:  really should know about the current science

0.31%:  forgot to include that really
0.31%:  think you just blew that out
0.31%:  think that would be a great science
0.31%:  would like to return to the subject of al
0.31%:  really want to go there
0.31%:  just figured out that we can all
0.31%:  would like to be one
0.50%:  would like to be one of the
0.31%:  think science just found out a way
0.31%:  reject this theory for not
0.31%:  just forgot that
0.38%:  just forgot that dark
0.31%:  just thought of a real world science
0.31%:  totally just figured out a new science!!
0.31%:  feel like science just got a whole ton
0.31%:  want to go to the library and

0.31%:  thought you were just kinda
0.31%:  do not know about you
0.40%:  do not know about you but
0.31%:  think the science world just got cool
0.31%:  should write a book about that fr
0.31%:  thought science was cool!!
0.31%:  just won the science lottery and bought
0.31%:  just talked about science while not
0.31%:  just got a new theory about science called
0.31%:  need to work on science facts that
0.31%:  just blew all our energy on
0.49%:  just blew all our energy on that
0.31%:  could write a book about your

0.31%:  just got a theory for science
0.31%:  could be talking about real science on
0.31%:  think you were just about to get
0.31%:  think you need to follow that
0.31%:  should get to the science center
0.31%:  sure would like to go to that science
1.72%:  sure would like to go to that science lecture
2.58%:  sure would like to go to that science lecture!!
0.31%:  need to go to the science library to learn about
0.31%:  thought we could trust science!!
0.31%:  just talked about science theory for longer than 
0.31%:  just got a theory that could be
0.31%:  think you just got the science award for real

0.31%:  totally just thought of a new science rock
0.31%:  would like to teach that
0.31%:  bet you could sell that to the
1.11%:  bet you could sell that to the science
0.31%:  forgot you were a science bro until that last
0.31%:  should totally write a book for the science center
0.31%:  would like to be clear that science just
0.31%:  gotta be honest here
0.31%:  do not recall agree
0.31%:  forgot you were here!!
0.31%:  need to get back to earth!!
0.31%:  forgot about all the current
0.92%:  forgot about all the current science
0.31%:  think you just blew a bunch of science at
0.31%:  need to go think about the fact
0.31%:  think we just got real science!!
0.31%:  hate to be wrong but holy
0.31%:  think you just won science bro battle!!

0.36%:  should be out there looking for science
0.31%:  think you just won the science b
0.31%:  just figured out another way to be the
0.31%:  need to borrow your black hole science
0.31%:  just talked about science for an entire blog
0.31%:  think you just changed all of science too!!
0.31%:  bet you that
0.31%:  thought you were still back at
0.31%:  was trying to talk

0.42%:  would not be the first to call you
0.39%:  would not be the first to argue
0.34%:  would not be the first guy
0.31%:  think you just changed science or
0.31%:  could totally win a science grant
0.31%:  just figured out what all science theory
0.31%:  hate you for asking
0.31%:  refuse to allow dark
0.31%:  just thought of a new science to learn called
0.31%:  could write a book for science ner
0.31%:  feel like that could turn out to be wrong!!
0.31%:  just won the science debate by
0.31%:  should totally get out of here
0.31%:  could be totally wrong about that science
0.31%:  just figured out how the real science
0.31%:  wrote a science book and then
0.63%:  wrote a science book and then forgot
0.31%:  really need to look into the
1.89%:  really need to look into the science
0.31%:  just took a theory
0.33%:  just took a theory that
0.31%:  hate to burst your flight
0.31%:  just thought of it and you blew
0.31%:  feel like that should be your job
0.31%:  feel like you just brought science to bear on an old
0.31%:  need to talk with you further
0.31%:  can totally see through dark
0.31%:  totally wrote that science
0.76%:  totally wrote that science book
0.51%:  totally wrote that science book!!
0.31%:  only just figured out the whole
0.31%:  used to think we
0.31%:  could be totally wrong about fr
0.31%:  think you just allowed for the actual
0.31%:  just got a new theory for science that could be
0.31%:  already know enough about science to settle
0.31%:  should write a science book totally
0.31%:  totally just figured out science bro
0.31%:  should totally write a book of re
0.31%:  need to figure out how to thank science
0.31%:  just forgot about all
1.73%:  just forgot about all the science
1.07%:  just forgot about all the other
0.79%:  just forgot about all the other science
0.38%:  just forgot about all the dark
0.31%:  forgot to tell you!!
0.31%:  would like to be clear that no
0.31%:  could be wrong about real
0.50%:  could be wrong about real science

0.33%:  could be wrong about real life
0.31%:  thought you were science bros and
0.31%:  need to talk to you about all
0.42%:  need to talk to you about all the science
0.31%:  just heard you talking about science for once
0.31%:  just ruined science for you both
0.31%:  just figured out the r
0.31%:  was totally joking there but
0.31%:  like that theory best!!
0.31%:  totally think we should go to
0.31%:  would like to start a science club for young
0.31%:  just want you
0.31%:  should totally write a science for
0.31%:  just thought of a way science can tell
0.31%:  would totally take a
0.51%:  would totally take a course
0.31%:  reject that theory on grounds of bull
0.31%:  could be wrong about the science but the last
0.31%:  think you just had science
0.31%:  gotta work
5.95%:  gotta work on that theory
4.61%:  gotta work on that theory!!
0.94%:  gotta work on that theory real
0.80%:  gotta work on that theory before
0.71%:  gotta work on that theory because
0.64%:  gotta work on that one
0.96%:  gotta work on that one!!
0.51%:  gotta work on this
1.45%:  gotta work on this theory
1.59%:  gotta work on this theory!!
0.46%:  gotta work on that science
0.43%:  gotta work on this theory before
0.36%:  gotta work on that theory for
0.82%:  gotta work on that theory for science
0.33%:  gotta work on that theory before science
0.31%:  kind of want to hug
0.31%:  need to call the science folks
0.79%:  need to call the science folks right
1.01%:  need to call the science folks right away
0.43%:  need to call the science folks about
0.31%:  need to talk to all the science guys who
0.31%:  just totally figured out how to balance
0.31%:  could be wrong about science for a
0.34%:  could be wrong about science for a little
0.31%:  would like to say for
0.31%:  should write a science book for 
0.31%:  swear to you that
0.31%:  hate to break it to you science nerds but we
0.36%:  hate to break it to you science nerds but we call
0.31%:  hate to break it to future
0.71%:  hate to break it to future science
0.31%:  just thought of a way to back
0.31%:  hate that you just broke science for
0.31%:  need science to work
4.94%:  need science to work on that right
2.43%:  need science to work on that theory
1.03%:  need science to work on this
1.80%:  need science to work on this theory
0.56%:  need science to work on that because
0.55%:  need science to work on that for
0.50%:  need science to work on that!!
0.45%:  need science to work on that theory!!
0.31%:  really should get back to what
0.31%:  reject this theory for now
0.55%:  reject this theory for now but
0.31%:  just caught you in
0.31%:  just thought of you and
0.31%:  wrote a science book and you
0.56%:  wrote a science book and you just
0.31%:  hate to break the bad news to you science
0.68%:  hate to break the bad news to you science bro
0.31%:  could totally be right about both science
0.31%:  thought of a counter to your
0.31%:  should totally write a science teacher joke
0.31%:  just thought of a way science could be non
0.31%:  should write a book on the science of bull
0.31%:  would take that theory far
0.31%:  just blew all our science right out the back!!
0.31%:  feel like you just tr
0.31%:  think you just lowered the bar for science to get
0.31%:  could be wrong about 
0.31%:  would totally not object
0.31%:  think you just forgot about all
2.26%:  think you just forgot about all the science
0.91%:  think you just forgot about all the science and
0.31%:  think you just forgot about all the science we
1.86%:  think you just forgot about all the science we learned
0.30%:  think we should forget about all our
0.30%:  forgot that they
0.30%:  think you just got one for the science board!!
0.30%:  used to think that you were cool!!
0.30%:  just broke the entire world of science to
0.30%:  clearly need to re
0.30%:  think you just cleaned
0.30%:  forgot about that and you blew
0.30%:  should really get on that book
0.30%:  think you just got cred
0.30%:  could see that theory working for a
0.30%:  feel like science just got real now
0.30%:  would not be able to say
0.30%:  think that would be really great
0.30%:  think you just won science bull
0.30%:  forgot that that
0.30%:  only just figured out how to breathe
0.30%:  would hate to be the one to burst your frag
0.30%:  look forward to that night
0.30%:  think we need to go to the science
0.31%:  think we need to go to the science lab
0.30%:  would just like to note here that you
0.30%:  thought you looked a
0.30%:  really should write science fact
0.30%:  just killed a theory!!
0.30%:  should write a science book that counter
0.30%:  clearly need to think about what
0.30%:  could be wrong about the science in that but
0.30%:  could be wrong about this but oh
0.30%:  think science just got way cooler and better!!
0.30%:  would like for that to be canon
0.30%:  just got owned by a science bro!!
0.30%:  totally figured out the whole
0.30%:  look forward to all the science being re
0.30%:  just blew all your science out the back end
0.32%:  just blew all your science out the back end of the
0.30%:  hate to burst your balloon here but we

0.30%:  forgot to think about all the ways science could be re
0.30%:  just thought of a counter!!
0.30%:  should totally be a science writer but
0.30%:  always thought it looked cool
0.30%:  thought we could be
0.30%:  think you just won our science bet
0.30%:  need to work on that theory real fast
0.77%:  need to work on that theory real fast!!
0.30%:  think you just won the bet for
0.30%:  thought it was totally fake!!
0.30%:  just got thrown into the
0.35%:  just got thrown into the dark

0.57%:  could really go with that!!
0.30%:  would like that to be a yes
0.30%:  thought you were not a
0.53%:  thought you were not a science
0.86%:  thought you were not a science bro!!
0.36%:  thought you were not a science bro for
0.32%:  thought you were not a science bro but
0.30%:  hate to be that guy!!
0.30%:  feel like we just science
0.30%:  should really get to know that
0.30%:  would hate to think science
0.30%:  really think we should get a
0.30%:  could write a book about all the science these
0.30%:  think we need to call our
1.21%:  think we need to call our science
0.30%:  really should be better about
0.30%:  was looking for science that could
0.30%:  really think we just found the real
0.30%:  could be talking about real science to
0.30%:  would like to be alone
0.30%:  just got way better
3.28%:  just got way better at science
2.30%:  just got way better at science!!
0.30%:  thought you were real for like
0.30%:  think we just brought science fact to
0.30%:  totally just heard the future being
1.57%:  totally just heard the future being born!!
0.30%:  think you just won the science table
0.30%:  could be wrong about all the rest of you
0.30%:  could totally be wrong about these freak
0.30%:  just figured out what all the cool ner
0.30%:  could be a science guy
0.30%:  think you just changed science for e
0.30%:  laughed because
0.30%:  always though
0.30%:  just blew all the science out of that one
0.37%:  just blew all the science out of that one!!
0.30%:  look forward to all the science con
0.30%:  need to figure out how to science just
0.30%:  need to borrow your clothes!!
0.30%:  thought for sure it would be a
0.30%:  do not know about such
0.30%:  would totally go for a
0.30%:  should think
0.30%:  just got idea for new theory!!
0.30%:  really need to go talk to this
0.30%:  think you just heard science blow
0.30%:  thought you were killed
0.30%:  could write the
0.38%:  could write the book
2.25%:  could write the book on that!!
0.37%:  could write the book that
0.33%:  could write the book on that one
0.30%:  should totally get a job in science after
0.30%:  would like to see your face
0.30%:  thought you were bad at science for
0.30%:  think you just won science for three
0.30%:  could talk about this one for the
0.30%:  could write a book about the science of just
0.30%:  could totally go for those
0.30%:  think you just changed our science to
0.30%:  thought for sure science would notice
0.30%:  just got all the science without
0.30%:  can barely breathe for
0.30%:  told you it was fake
0.36%:  told you it was fake!!
0.30%:  should totally write a book for science teacher
0.30%:  thought we talked about all
0.30%:  forgot about how science totally
0.30%:  think the science just got too real for once!!
0.30%:  bet you could write a book that sell
0.30%:  should write a science book that no
0.30%:  think you just brought all of science to a brand
0.30%:  could be wrong about the entire fr
0.30%:  could totally be wrong but
0.30%:  could be talking about science too
0.40%:  could be talking about science too!!
0.30%:  could be totally right about what
0.30%:  could totally write a science book about just
0.30%:  clearly need to write a blog
0.54%:  clearly need to write a blog about
0.30%:  really should get that book
0.30%:  hate to be the one to blow your science
0.30%:  refuse to think about how badly
0.30%:  think you just got all the science done!!
0.30%:  think we just got our science fact
0.30%:  just heard science talk without
0.30%:  thought you would be able
0.30%:  really wanted to get out
0.30%:  think we just changed science for our
0.30%:  just blew your science right the fuck
0.30%:  look forward to telling the truth because
0.30%:  really forgot about that whole science
0.30%:  just got the theory
0.30%:  really need to figure out what colour that
0.30%:  need to talk to you for hours later
0.32%:  need to talk to you for hours later!!
0.30%:  could write a science book on the
0.30%:  like the sound of science that
0.30%:  could talk about science for years!!
0.30%:  want you
0.30%:  need to figure out science so
0.30%:  feel like science just let
0.30%:  could be wrong for the only
0.30%:  could be wrong about the rest of science theory but
0.30%:  think we just found our global science
0.30%:  feel like we should try
0.36%:  feel like we should try to
0.30%:  just figured out the science to a theory
0.30%:  just got a new theory that could be science
0.30%:  got you there!!
0.30%:  just figured out what the real role
0.30%:  think the science world just got real for you
0.30%:  forgot about black holes and white
0.30%:  think you just won the science all
0.30%:  told you there were no such
0.30%:  hate to be racist but you know
0.30%:  forgot that science isn
0.30%:  feel like you just brought science down to a
0.30%:  just got that idea!!
0.30%:  think our theory about
0.30%:  forgot to rule out all the science!!
0.30%:  forgot about black holes but now they
0.30%:  think you need to call science about that!!
0.30%:  always thought it could be one
0.30%:  just figured out a totally new science!!
0.30%:  forgot all about science and just
0.30%:  would call these
0.30%:  would like to eat that theory!!
0.30%:  hate to be a
0.50%:  hate to be a jerk
1.32%:  hate to be a jerk about
0.62%:  hate to be a jerk about this but you
0.58%:  hate to be a jerk but
0.39%:  hate to be a jerk about it
0.34%:  hate to be a jerk about this but your
0.33%:  hate to be a jerk about this but science
0.31%:  hate to be a jerk but that
0.30%:  just figured out how to be really ob
0.30%:  feel like you just got blown out
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about this fr
0.30%:  could write a book about the theory!!
0.30%:  think they just found
0.35%:  think they just found out
0.30%:  just figured out how to thank
0.30%:  figured that out years
0.30%:  thought you were d
0.30%:  think we just found the science lecture
0.30%:  should totally be a science teacher but for
0.30%:  think you better call science about
0.30%:  think you forgot to breathe just
0.35%:  think you forgot to breathe just now!!
0.30%:  just had a new theory!!
0.30%:  need to call science guys
0.53%:  need to call science guys about
0.30%:  bet you could get that
0.30%:  forgot all about the recent theory
0.30%:  should totally write a book before the
0.67%:  should totally write a book before the science
0.30%:  really thought we found
0.68%:  really thought we found out
0.30%:  bet dark
0.35%:  bet dark energy
0.30%:  could be wrong about the rest of you all
0.30%:  need to figure out how to talk about science!!
0.30%:  thought for sure you were one
0.30%:  think there are
0.30%:  write
0.54%:  write science
0.30%:  was totally right but
0.30%:  would like that to count
0.30%:  could be talking about science but also
0.30%:  really hate to be wrong about science
0.30%:  just got called out by science without
0.30%:  forgot you know about that
0.30%:  feel like you just won science though
0.30%:  really think there
0.30%:  could talk about science with other
0.30%:  hate that you know too
0.30%:  cannot tell whether or
0.30%:  totally forgot about the science when
0.30%:  like your cut of the science grant
0.30%:  just called you a fake bro to
0.30%:  just got an idea for all
1.10%:  just got an idea for all the science
0.30%:  totally forgot that could be where
0.30%:  thought you were all about dis
0.30%:  just talked about science for real
0.30%:  could write a book about the journey
0.30%:  need to figure out how to buy a
0.30%:  need to take this theory to science
0.30%:  look forward to telling science just that
0.30%:  think you just found a better science career!!
0.30%:  totally think we should go out
0.30%:  would argue that they are not

0.30%:  forgot to include all other
0.30%:  think our science just got all
0.43%:  think our science just got all the
0.30%:  could totally see that working for the science ner
0.30%:  forgot you know about science and
0.30%:  just thought of a new line
0.30%:  feel like you just un
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about both
0.31%:  could be totally wrong about both science
0.30%:  just told you that gi

0.30%:  hate to be the one to burst your big dark
0.30%:  should write to
0.34%:  should write to science
0.30%:  just threw out a bunch of science and it
0.30%:  totally just figured out how there can be no
0.30%:  could be wrong about this but all the

0.30%:  feel like you just went through a lo
0.30%:  think you just robbed science of that
0.30%:  hate you for knowing better

0.30%:  really should get back to science when
0.30%:  would like that to be the case only
0.30%:  would like to see the science on that for
0.30%:  just got called out by science while
0.30%:  think we just found the core science
0.30%:  just thought of a better new
0.30%:  really wrote that out
0.31%:  really wrote that out loud
0.30%:  went to school for a long
0.30%:  think you just heard a science fact get

0.30%:  think we should all get out of our science
0.30%:  told you that science
0.31%:  told you that science was
0.30%:  want to hug you so bad but
0.30%:  think you just won all the science cred
0.30%:  totally just broke through into science
0.30%:  just got all the science worked

0.30%:  forgot all about the science and
0.36%:  forgot all about the science and just
0.30%:  hate to be the one to bring you all
0.30%:  need to get to work on this science
0.30%:  hate to do

0.30%:  forgot that science is really
0.30%:  just won the science debate club
0.30%:  really just want to hear
0.30%:  just forgot how to science real
0.30%:  just thought of a science you
0.30%:  just figured out how to label
0.30%:  already know enough about science to reject this fr
0.30%:  think you just forced a science
0.30%:  would kill for that to be true but science
0.30%:  think we got science
0.30%:  need to talk to you further about science when
0.30%:  think you just changed science to be a lot
0.30%:  look forward to telling the truth once science
0.30%:  could be looking at a

0.30%:  thought you wanted to be careful
0.30%:  forgot to count that one
0.30%:  can no
0.30%:  could totally write another science book just
0.30%:  should really go to the science fair
0.30%:  really just thought of it now
0.30%:  could be right you
0.30%:  forgot to tell you there would
0.35%:  forgot to tell you there would be a science
0.30%:  can totally see that working out for science bro
0.30%:  feel like our
0.49%:  feel like our science
0.50%:  feel like our science just
0.46%:  feel like our science just got way
0.53%:  feel like our science just got way cool
1.17%:  feel like our science just got way cooler!!
0.31%:  feel like our science just got real

0.30%:  cannot tell you how right
0.30%:  just thought of a better way dark
0.30%:  think you just changed all of science !!
0.30%:  think we all just got our science theory on
0.30%:  like that theory about
0.30%:  could write a book about the truth of science
0.30%:  think we should be careful not to rule
0.30%:  think the science just blew your
0.30%:  just blew science right out of our
0.30%:  look forward to testing the
0.38%:  look forward to testing the theory!!
0.30%:  just figured out how to not be an
0.30%:  could be wrong about all these other bro
0.30%:  forgot you could still hear
0.30%:  just thought of a cool way to be
0.30%:  could be wrong about all of this you

0.30%:  think you just wrote a science blog better
0.30%:  just wrote a theory of science that
0.30%:  need to talk to an
0.30%:  just broke the entire world of science that
0.30%:  just got a whole bunch of science to learn
0.30%:  would not rule that theory
0.60%:  would not rule that theory out!!
0.30%:  would not rule that theory out for
0.30%:  really should be working for
0.38%:  really should be working for the
1.09%:  really should be working for the science
0.33%:  really should be working for science
0.30%:  think you just allowed science to reach
0.30%:  can totally feel
0.30%:  look forward to seeing the science you
0.30%:  should totally be a science bro!!
0.30%:  just figured the
0.32%:  just figured the whole
0.30%:  gotta find out where that
0.30%:  forgot to do
0.30%:  totally just thought of our new science career!!
0.30%:  need to work on the science of
0.30%:  just thought of a really nice science book
0.30%:  think we just found science truth
0.30%:  should totally get a science career
0.39%:  should totally get a science career!!
0.30%:  just figured out where all that non
0.30%:  could be totally wrong about our entire science
0.46%:  could be totally wrong about our entire science!!
0.30%:  find that

0.30%:  just blew your entire science talk
0.62%:  just blew your entire science talk out of the god
0.30%:  think you found the secret to all our
0.30%:  just created a theory about science
0.30%:  just talked to a science guy about
0.30%:  just figured out the science to black
0.30%:  should write a science book later
0.30%:  totally just figured out how to science black
0.30%:  need to write a science blog!!
0.30%:  look forward to the science telling us about the
0.30%:  hate to be wrong about science but holy
0.30%:  was born to figure out the truth once
0.30%:  think you were just born to be laughed at for
0.30%:  just walked into a science theory
0.30%:  should totally write science fact book about
0.30%:  forgot how to science
0.30%:  would agree
0.30%:  need to figure out how to break science
0.30%:  need to go think about that for real!!
0.30%:  look forward to all your science
0.30%:  thought you were for science and reason!!
0.30%:  would like to science that!!

0.53%:  need to be careful about
0.42%:  need to be careful about who
0.30%:  forgot the answer could be that science
0.30%:  look forward to using the science
0.30%:  should write that science fact book about
0.30%:  can see through your dark
0.30%:  just went through a full
0.30%:  totally need to figure out what colour
0.30%:  refuse to allow science to be brought into the
0.30%:  just got called out for science on
0.30%:  wrote a science book and it turns
0.30%:  just got all science on you there!!
0.30%:  just got hit by a science bullet and now there
0.30%:  just figured out how to talk to science bro

0.30%:  could talk about nothing for
0.44%:  could talk about nothing for hours
0.33%:  could talk about nothing for the

0.48%:  need to talk to this guy later!!
0.30%:  think science just got really hard to
0.30%:  could be the first guy to know about the science
0.30%:  really should get back to not
0.30%:  could get a
0.30%:  could be wrong about the nature of this
0.30%:  would totally go to science
0.30%:  should write a book about the only true science fact!!
0.30%:  think we should forget science
0.30%:  should be talking to you!!
0.30%:  should write a science fact book only
0.30%:  reject this theory due
0.30%:  need to go talk to this
0.30%:  can totally take
0.30%:  feel like science just got a whole butt
0.30%:  just got science friend
0.30%:  look forward to nothing else

0.29%:  really just thought of science
0.29%:  hate it when science turns out to be a
0.29%:  used to think you were the science bro
0.29%:  like the sound of your science better!!
0.29%:  just got called out by science fr
0.29%:  could be right about these fake bro
0.29%:  should go write a book about science
0.29%:  just figured out where all the cat
0.29%:  used to think you were a science bro but then
0.29%:  could totally be wrong about this for science
0.29%:  could be totally wrong about the science bro

0.29%:  think you just won the science debate of our era
1.12%:  think you just won the science debate of our era!!
0.29%:  would like to share the
0.29%:  need to be careful who
0.29%:  forgot about this theory called
0.29%:  could really get into those
0.29%:  just figured out theory
0.29%:  just got an idea for how to che
0.29%:  look forward to telling science teacher
0.29%:  should write that book before any
0.29%:  should totally write a science book out

0.29%:  would hate to think you
0.29%:  would be so into
1.63%:  would be so into that!!
0.91%:  would be so into that theory
1.44%:  would be so into that theory!!
0.29%:  should write a book about theory science
0.29%:  just thought of new science career!!
0.29%:  just talked about science theory with an

0.46%:  could be wrong about at least 
0.31%:  could be wrong about at least one of
0.29%:  just need to figure out how to lock
0.29%:  clearly need to write a book about science thought
0.29%:  like your science better than the
0.29%:  hate you for asking that but

0.29%:  just got tricked by an
0.29%:  just blew all our current science to
0.29%:  already knew about the
0.29%:  should really write a book about science for
0.29%:  could talk about science for an hour
0.29%:  just thought of a brand new science to talk
0.29%:  just figured out who the real science
0.56%:  just figured out who the real science bro
0.29%:  need science to work on this theory!!
0.29%:  just figured out that not only are we all
0.29%:  hate you all for knowing
0.29%:  feel like they could just
0.29%:  should write a blog entry about that for science!!
0.29%:  choose to ignore that for
0.29%:  could be totally wrong about the science here but in
0.29%:  need to work on a
0.50%:  need to work on a theory
0.54%:  need to work on a theory for
1.68%:  need to work on a theory for that!!

0.29%:  could be totally wrong about this science but
0.29%:  just figured out how to be all the cool
0.38%:  just figured out how to be all the cool science
0.29%:  think you just learned about science the
0.29%:  could be wrong about all the science just for that
0.29%:  only just thought about it
0.29%:  feel like science just got way cooler to
0.29%:  just thought of a brand new science to look
0.29%:  could be wrong about the science but finally
0.29%:  just got a little harder
0.29%:  need to look that theory
0.29%:  think we can all agree you
0.94%:  think we can all agree you just
0.40%:  think we can all agree you should
0.29%:  feel like science just got two
0.29%:  think we all just found science!!
0.29%:  just got turned on by science for like a whole hour!!
0.29%:  think you just won the science detect
0.29%:  refuse to look into whether
0.29%:  forgot about all the other science and
0.29%:  hate to break it to you fellow science nerds but our
0.29%:  just figured out all the real science!!
0.29%:  would totally go for those
0.29%:  just got all the science on you
0.29%:  think you just brought science down a r
0.29%:  think you just let a
0.29%:  just broke through to a new reality!!

0.29%:  feel like that would change science just
0.29%:  would like to go on a
0.29%:  just broke the fourth wall and your
0.29%:  forgot about this whole science
0.29%:  figured out what science
0.29%:  forgot to include all these other science
0.29%:  gotta sit
1.56%:  gotta sit down for
0.80%:  gotta sit down!!
0.56%:  gotta sit down before
0.29%:  could be totally wrong here but this
0.29%:  forgot about the actual science theory
0.29%:  really need to think about that for 
0.29%:  look forward to science turning
0.29%:  just went to
0.57%:  just went to the trouble
0.97%:  just went to the trouble of ruling
0.70%:  just went to the trouble of deb
0.40%:  just went to the trouble of calling

0.29%:  should write a letter to a
4.24%:  should write a letter to a science
0.29%:  forgot to say there are
0.29%:  would like to be a science guy
0.29%:  think you just changed two of our
0.29%:  think we just found our science theory to
0.29%:  can see through you!!

0.75%:  think you should run for science
0.29%:  was right about the fake
0.29%:  just figured out how to be a total
0.29%:  look forward to science being really
0.29%:  think the science just got way too real for once!!
0.29%:  just figured out what the block
0.29%:  really should get on that book
0.29%:  think that could be true for sure
0.29%:  could be talking about the real

0.29%:  just figured out a way to science the he
0.29%:  just thought of a new lecture
0.29%:  just figured out the only real science
0.29%:  just figured out that science too
0.29%:  think science just got really cool for three
0.29%:  could be talking about real science you
0.29%:  could be talking about science just
0.29%:  look forward to seeing that science theory
0.29%:  could write a book on all

0.67%:  could write a book on all the science that
0.29%:  just figured out how all science can be broken
0.29%:  think you just allowed for the real
0.29%:  just noticed a
0.29%:  think we all just agreed science
0.29%:  thought you were actual science bros before
0.29%:  think science just went
0.29%:  think you just won a gold
0.29%:  totally just figured out how to be a real science hero
0.29%:  thought you were all fake too until
0.29%:  would think about that for about
0.29%:  refuse to think about how utterly
0.29%:  was totally joking before but that could be our
0.29%:  should write a book about real science but only
0.29%:  think you just got the science bro award!!
0.29%:  totally just thought of a real science book
0.29%:  just thought of a new science to build
0.29%:  should be out there working for

0.31%:  could be wrong about the science of this one!!
0.29%:  think you just created one for science
0.29%:  think you are both wrong
0.29%:  forgot to call dark

0.40%:  do not know about your science
0.37%:  do not know about your science but
0.29%:  forgot to say that there could
0.29%:  think our science just found
0.29%:  hate to sound like a science bro but what
0.29%:  would hate to think you just
0.29%:  need to write all of
0.29%:  feel like that should get you
0.29%:  think we just got our theory of science
0.29%:  could be totally wrong about science just
0.29%:  just wrote a science fact book right
0.75%:  just wrote a science fact book right here
0.75%:  just wrote a science fact book right here!!
0.55%:  just wrote a science fact book right there
0.29%:  just wrote a science fact book right here on
0.29%:  could be wrong about the truth of all
0.29%:  laughed out
0.29%:  need to figure out how to sell science
0.29%:  already thought of it
0.29%:  totally just thought of science now
0.29%:  thought you were naked
0.29%:  thought you were an adult science
0.29%:  need to go call science

0.52%:  need to be alone right
0.29%:  would totally hang out in
0.29%:  think you just heard science fact
0.29%:  think science just got better for real
0.29%:  already regret
0.29%:  just talked about science for that

0.29%:  think you forgot that
0.29%:  would call that an
0.29%:  only just figured out how the
0.29%:  could not think of a better way to lose
0.29%:  already forgot about it
0.34%:  already forgot about it!!
0.29%:  thought it would be really
0.29%:  laughed at you
0.29%:  could be wrong about science history for

0.29%:  would buy tickets for that!!
0.29%:  think you just called regular
0.29%:  just got a whole bunch of dark
0.29%:  think you just robbed science of all that
0.29%:  really need to figure out just
0.54%:  really need to figure out just what
0.42%:  really need to figure out just how to
0.37%:  really need to figure out just how science
0.29%:  wrote a book on
1.06%:  wrote a book on that!!
0.96%:  wrote a book on that subject
0.57%:  wrote a book on that subject!!
0.49%:  wrote a book on that theory

0.38%:  should write a book about all the fun science
0.29%:  think you just blew all our science at
3.69%:  think you just blew all our science at once!!
0.29%:  clearly need to look further into that
0.29%:  need to think about how true
0.29%:  know science
0.29%:  should totally write a science future
1.12%:  should totally write a science future book
0.44%:  should totally write a science future book!!
0.29%:  was about to call the flying
0.29%:  think science just found out all
0.29%:  thought you were real and not
0.59%:  thought you were real and not just
0.29%:  totally just ruined the whole
0.69%:  totally just ruined the whole science

0.29%:  bet you just
0.38%:  bet you just thought
0.35%:  bet you just thought of dark
0.29%:  feel like you just brought the cool
0.29%:  just called you out for being real
0.29%:  should look that one
0.29%:  totally forgot we had science to
0.29%:  just need to figure out how to science all
0.29%:  need to go back to the library for just
0.29%:  look forward to hearing the science to
0.29%:  can hardly
0.29%:  think our science teacher just got way
0.30%:  think our science teacher just got way too
0.29%:  think you just brought down all science to be
0.29%:  think you better watch out for all
0.29%:  would hate to be that guy
0.29%:  should write a book about the trouble

0.29%:  should totally get into science after
0.29%:  hate to be wrong about such
0.29%:  really need to go back to first
0.29%:  look forward to the science lecture tonight!!
0.29%:  just blew all our science right out of the year
0.29%:  get to be
0.29%:  just heard science talk for
0.29%:  just got a new theory of science and
0.29%:  just talked about science for an hour!!
0.29%:  just thought about it for one
0.29%:  just thought about science for two
0.29%:  just got turned on to science by a fr
0.29%:  think you should go tell science
1.61%:  think you should go tell science about
0.29%:  thought of a science
0.29%:  look forward to this science lecture!!
0.29%:  think you just changed science better for
0.44%:  think you just changed science better for all
0.29%:  forgot about black holes until now
0.29%:  really should work on being better about science
0.29%:  could totally use that for a book
0.29%:  just got science on your
0.29%:  just wrote a book and then you
0.29%:  could totally be a genius
0.33%:  could totally be a genius!!
0.29%:  would listen to that guy
0.29%:  need to learn about this
0.29%:  just blew all their

0.29%:  could be wrong about science for like three
0.29%:  just totally thought of a new science book!!
0.29%:  think you just had to
0.29%:  could write a science book just to argue
0.29%:  think you just brought down 
0.29%:  would totally be there
3.39%:  would totally be there for that science
3.28%:  would totally be there for that!!
1.06%:  would totally be there for that one
0.95%:  would totally be there for that one!!
0.79%:  would totally be there for that science!!
0.31%:  would totally be there for this
0.29%:  think that would just
1.03%:  think that would just be regular
0.47%:  think that would just be regular science
0.29%:  think you just won the science bro debate of our
0.29%:  think you need to go further
0.29%:  hate you all right now for
0.29%:  think that would just be science
0.29%:  just need to figure out how to be a science
0.29%:  thought you looked cute in
0.29%:  could be totally wrong about this science after
0.29%:  just got a new theory about science for
0.29%:  thought you were an adult too
0.67%:  thought you were an adult too!!
0.29%:  think you just rewrote all the science bro!!

0.29%:  forgot to use science to rule
0.32%:  forgot to use science to rule out dark
0.29%:  just ate
0.29%:  reject that on the grounds you
0.29%:  could talk for hours about how great science
0.29%:  think you just brought all of science to a craw
0.29%:  just figured out a way to be a
0.29%:  would like for that to be a theory
0.29%:  look forward to either
0.29%:  just need to figure out how to roll
0.29%:  look forward to the science lecture they
0.29%:  really just wrote a book that
0.29%:  think we could both agree
0.29%:  thought you could feel
0.29%:  thought we could settle science
0.29%:  totally forgot about this new
0.29%:  totally forgot about this new science
0.29%:  just figured out what the one
0.29%:  just blew your idea out of the ball
0.29%:  should get back to you with an
0.29%:  feel like you just brought science to a halt
0.29%:  could totally be working on the science for
0.40%:  could totally be working on the science for the
0.29%:  would like for that to be the best science
0.29%:  would like to turn
0.38%:  would like to turn that
0.29%:  just got another theory!!
0.29%:  thought science was cool until dark
0.29%:  already thought of it!!
0.29%:  hate to break this to you but no
0.29%:  would take that theory as
0.29%:  look forward to science being able to reject
0.29%:  really need to figure out how to science!!
0.29%:  should go write that science book!!
0.29%:  was totally joking before but that one could
0.29%:  thought you were about to break
0.29%:  should totally go into science now!!
0.29%:  just got a totally new idea for lunch

0.29%:  totally forgot there was another kind
0.29%:  think you just won science at
0.32%:  think you just won science at the
0.32%:  think you just won science at large
0.29%:  could be wrong about the theory of science
0.29%:  can feel science being
0.29%:  just freaked out there
0.29%:  just totally got science
0.29%:  totally just blew the science out
0.29%:  just got an idea for all the science!!

0.35%:  can totally see it!!
0.29%:  just gained
0.29%:  really blew
0.29%:  could be talking to real
0.32%:  could be talking to real science
0.29%:  only just now figured out that all science
0.29%:  think science just found the true
0.29%:  think science just found actual
0.29%:  thought you were real for a second but no
0.29%:  just got the idea for a science book where all
0.29%:  just thought of a new science nick
0.29%:  think science just found out how to tell
0.29%:  could talk about that for 
0.29%:  think you just won our debate for
0.29%:  just figured out a way to be science
0.29%:  hate to burst your balloon of science but the

0.29%:  reject this out of hand only
0.29%:  just fell down a rabbit hole about the
0.29%:  feel like that just brought science down to
0.29%:  totally just blew science right
0.29%:  was totally right about the science
0.29%:  look forward to your best science
0.29%:  just got called a science bro by a bro who
0.29%:  could write books about science that
0.29%:  would be the first to laugh at your joke
0.28%:  think we should totally get our
1.15%:  think we should totally get our science
0.28%:  would really hate to be the first to
0.28%:  really should get out of town
0.28%:  would rate this theory 
0.28%:  hate to be the one to kill your grand
0.28%:  just forgot to include all the other science
0.28%:  think we just learned about science for real
0.28%:  just figured out where all the science talk
0.28%:  could totally use that for science!!

0.28%:  just got turned on by science for a whole three
0.28%:  think you just got all the science we
0.28%:  think you just brought science fact to a
0.28%:  need to figure out how to crush all science
0.28%:  could be talking about science here but then
0.28%:  clearly need to write books for
0.28%:  could be wrong about the science but that feels
0.28%:  should go into
1.83%:  should go into science
0.44%:  should go into science!!
0.30%:  should go into science after
1.28%:  should go into science after all!!
0.28%:  think you just won science battle for
0.28%:  would rather not talk about such
0.28%:  was trying to talk about science
0.28%:  should get a job at the science center for
0.28%:  would like that story to be true enough
0.28%:  should write a science book to get
0.28%:  thought you were all science before!!
0.28%:  just got hit by dark

1.27%:  think you found out the secret
0.28%:  think science just got real hard
0.28%:  just figured out how to betray
1.13%:  just figured out how to betray science
0.28%:  totally just thought of dark bro
0.28%:  just got talked into science by
0.28%:  just need to figure out how to let science
0.28%:  forgot to rule out that science
0.28%:  just got the idea to
0.28%:  just broke the entire world of science all
0.31%:  just broke the entire world of science all by
0.28%:  just figured out totally
0.65%:  just figured out totally what
0.28%:  think we found a theory to
0.28%:  think you just brought science to table
0.28%:  could be totally wrong about the science before

0.98%:  just got killed by science!!
0.28%:  bet you thought science would take
0.28%:  should write a book about all the science for
0.28%:  thought you were abandon
0.28%:  kind of want that to be true because holy
0.28%:  think you just found science all the better
0.28%:  think you just told a better science

0.28%:  need to figure out what colour those
0.28%:  think you just won the science but
0.28%:  just finally
0.28%:  thought it was science
0.28%:  totally think we just found our
0.28%:  could be wrong about the reason
0.28%:  forget that you know all
5.95%:  forget that you know all about science
1.06%:  forget that you know all about science!!

0.28%:  look forward to all these
0.28%:  could write a story about the
0.28%:  really just figured out that we
0.28%:  could get really into science for
0.28%:  think our theory of science
0.89%:  think our theory of science just
0.80%:  think our theory of science just got blown
0.41%:  think our theory of science just got turned
0.28%:  hate to break it to you gentle
0.28%:  could totally be wrong about the entire fr

0.28%:  thought for sure you wanted to be a
0.28%:  would like for that theory to be real so

0.28%:  need to start buying
0.28%:  just got a totally new idea of
0.28%:  just got hit by one of the world
0.28%:  could be wrong about the science just
0.28%:  think you just let science fall

0.28%:  just blew your fake
0.98%:  just blew your fake giant
0.28%:  could be wrong about that one you
0.28%:  should write a book about the science of regular
0.28%:  just figured out non
0.28%:  just found a new theory to argue
0.28%:  told you there was nothing to fear!!
0.28%:  think that could just be real!!
0.28%:  just thought of a way it could all be science!!
0.28%:  forgot that you were here!!

0.28%:  would rather not talk about it
0.34%:  would rather not talk about it!!
0.28%:  just figured out all the science now
0.28%:  look forward to science being all
0.28%:  thought for certain nobody else
0.28%:  just thought of a new double
0.28%:  feel like that could be what science
0.28%:  totally should write a science book or

0.65%:  totally wrote this joke before science caught
0.28%:  just figured out how not to be a
0.28%:  just got all the science out
0.28%:  just figured out how to alter the science
0.28%:  kinda want that to be true for

0.28%:  just really want to be right for
1.45%:  just really want to be right for once!!
0.44%:  just really want to be right for once about
0.28%:  totally just got blown
0.28%:  just thought of a radical new science book
0.28%:  just broke the theory of science
0.28%:  need to figure out how to carbon
0.28%:  forgot about black holes but they would
0.28%:  hate you for knowing all the cool

0.28%:  really thought for sure it
0.94%:  really thought for sure it would
0.30%:  really thought for sure it would take
0.28%:  feel like that one should
0.28%:  feel like science just got a bunch harder!!

0.28%:  could be the first guy to be
0.28%:  think that could well
1.00%:  think that could well be true
0.86%:  think that could well be true!!

0.28%:  would like that to be true a
1.28%:  would like that to be true a lot!!
0.28%:  forgot what it
0.28%:  just talked about science for a whole hour

0.28%:  was right before
0.54%:  was right before but
0.28%:  think you just created both a science
0.28%:  need to figure out what all the science books
0.28%:  need you to write that for

0.28%:  just got the idea for a new rock
0.28%:  just got turned on by science after
0.28%:  need to get back to you with

0.28%:  forgot about all the science now
0.28%:  think you just ground
0.28%:  should write a book then!!
0.28%:  just created a working theory of science out
0.28%:  think you just blew all of the science outta

0.28%:  would like that to be a fact
0.28%:  just got fact
0.28%:  need to start looking for the
0.28%:  just figured out how to be both a real science
0.28%:  just figured out how to talk science at a
0.28%:  should totally write a book of the
0.36%:  should totally write a book of the science
0.28%:  really should get back into the science of
0.28%:  just broke through science into a
0.28%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole on your butt

0.28%:  refuse to look that
0.28%:  just heard a science theory about
0.28%:  just got a better theory of science
0.28%:  forget that you know all about science but
0.28%:  totally had
0.28%:  thought we talked about only
0.28%:  think you just won the science debate club of

0.40%:  just thought about a new kind of science!!
0.28%:  would totally be there for such
0.28%:  just figured out another way to talk science
0.28%:  sure would like to be a fly on that science
0.28%:  can totally get behind that for

0.27%:  just blew that theory about
0.27%:  really should be better at science!!
0.27%:  forgot to tell you this but
0.27%:  just wanted to figure
0.27%:  thought you were like a

0.27%:  just blew your science right out of that
0.27%:  could be wrong about the last 
0.27%:  really should know better than to go for
0.27%:  do not know because
0.27%:  just figured out whether or not al
0.27%:  forgot about the weird science theory

0.58%:  just blew our entire theory of science out
0.27%:  just figured out black hole
2.58%:  just figured out black hole theory
2.50%:  just figured out black hole theory!!
0.27%:  totally figured out the answer to science!!
0.27%:  could be totally wrong about it
0.27%:  hate to burst your science balloon but we
0.27%:  think you just lowered the science bar to a
0.27%:  thought you worked on
0.27%:  bet you could sell that science book for

0.27%:  forgot that science could be so
0.27%:  need to figure out what those
0.27%:  think you just changed four
0.27%:  think we should be careful not to be
0.27%:  think our science just got a
1.03%:  think our science just got a whole
0.30%:  think our science just got a whole lot real
0.27%:  totally just figured the whole science
0.27%:  would not call
0.39%:  would not call that theory
0.30%:  would not call that science
0.28%:  would not call that fake
0.27%:  really should get a better science book!!
0.27%:  would like to see your science lab
0.27%:  would just like to note that your face
0.27%:  should write a blog entry about the
0.38%:  should write a blog entry about the science
0.27%:  just got an idea for how they
0.27%:  could talk about science but
0.27%:  forgot about all the science now!!
0.27%:  could be wrong about the real nature of science
0.52%:  could be wrong about the real nature of science!!
0.27%:  would like that theory to be canon
0.27%:  just got an idea for our science
0.27%:  only thought of dark
0.27%:  hate to break this to all of science but you
0.27%:  totally forgot the science behind
0.27%:  feel like that could turn out to be science
0.27%:  look forward to telling that one at science
0.27%:  think you got us
0.27%:  just created a theory for all
0.27%:  just wrote a science book that finally
0.27%:  could totally win the freak
0.27%:  need to go to the science library after all
1.05%:  need to go to the science library after all!!
0.27%:  think you just got real there for
0.27%:  would argue that the only reason
0.27%:  just figured out what an
0.27%:  like the sound of that actual
3.41%:  like the sound of that actual science
2.16%:  like the sound of that actual science!!
0.52%:  like the sound of that actual science guy
0.27%:  could see that working for about
0.40%:  could see that working for about three
0.27%:  feel like you just got thrown
0.27%:  totally need to figure out a
0.27%:  think you better go tell
0.27%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but thank
0.27%:  just got a science boner for the entire
0.27%:  forgot about the secret science
0.27%:  will need
0.38%:  will need to consult
0.35%:  will need to look
0.28%:  will need to look further
0.27%:  just talked about science theory while
0.27%:  always thought it could be better
0.27%:  could totally be wrong about this fr
0.27%:  just thought of non
0.27%:  just got hit by a science fact bullet and
0.27%:  could be totally wrong about this bro
0.69%:  could be totally wrong about this bro science
0.60%:  could be totally wrong about this bro science!!
0.27%:  could be looking at the answer to science
0.27%:  hate to break it to you and
0.55%:  hate to break it to you and science
0.27%:  think you just got too real!!
0.27%:  just went full science bro on that
0.27%:  hate to burst your balloon science
0.27%:  lost track of the science
0.51%:  lost track of the science there
0.27%:  forgot to eat lunch but
0.27%:  think we just found our global theory
0.27%:  just got an idea that
0.27%:  would not like
0.52%:  would not like that
0.49%:  would not like to be the
0.35%:  would not like to be the guy
0.27%:  just need to get back to the
0.68%:  just need to get back to the library
0.42%:  just need to get back to the lab
0.27%:  just figured out a way to let
0.43%:  just figured out a way to let science
0.27%:  would rate that theory about 
0.27%:  really just thought of a better science
0.27%:  think you just got all the science real
0.27%:  could be wrong about all of science history then
0.27%:  think the world just got about one
0.27%:  would bet you
0.27%:  could argue
0.64%:  could argue that
0.64%:  could argue with
2.40%:  could argue with that!!
1.53%:  could argue with that for
0.81%:  could argue with that but
0.43%:  could argue with that one
0.64%:  could argue with that one for
0.51%:  could argue with that one!!
0.29%:  could argue that theory
0.27%:  think you just cured all science of
0.27%:  just figured out all at once both
0.31%:  just figured out all at once both the
0.29%:  just figured out all at once both what
0.27%:  could be right about there
0.27%:  should write a science book for totally
0.27%:  would be the first to call science on that!!
0.27%:  could write a story for
0.27%:  think you just created a science too
0.27%:  could be wrong about all this before
0.27%:  could be wrong about the science for only
0.27%:  would listen to your science lecture
0.27%:  want to be that guy so
0.39%:  want to be that guy so bad!!
0.27%:  just broke through all reality
0.27%:  think you just f
0.27%:  would like to hear no
0.39%:  would like to hear no further
0.35%:  would like to hear no further about
0.27%:  could be wrong about this but only for
0.27%:  just got hit by the science bullet of
0.27%:  just got called out by science for what
0.27%:  thought for certain you would see
0.27%:  totally want to hear
0.27%:  should totally write science fr
0.27%:  can say
0.68%:  can say without
0.75%:  can say without doubt
0.29%:  can say for
0.27%:  think you just brought science fact too
0.27%:  need to talk to this science guy about how
0.27%:  just broke through to a new science
0.27%:  look forward to science telling us they
0.27%:  think you just found her
0.27%:  bet you could write that on a blog
0.27%:  just really want to be right about one
0.27%:  could talk about other things!!
0.27%:  just blew all the science right out of today
0.27%:  just got a whole bunch of science bro
0.27%:  thought you could be
0.31%:  thought you could be reason
0.27%:  should write that book for you
0.27%:  think you just changed real science real
0.27%:  think you just created a science for all
0.27%:  totally just thought of one!!
0.27%:  really should be out

0.46%:  thought you were tall before but
0.27%:  really thought for a second!!
0.27%:  think you just found all the real
0.90%:  think you just found all the real science
0.27%:  had to think
0.28%:  had to think really
0.27%:  really thought it would be one
0.27%:  could be wrong about all of that science!!
0.27%:  would like that to be the best
0.27%:  can totally get on board for science
0.27%:  think you just found science where
0.27%:  would like to use
1.49%:  would like to use that theory

0.51%:  would like to use that theory for science
0.27%:  really need to figure out how to jack
0.27%:  just won the science book
0.27%:  think you just blew actual
3.88%:  think you just blew actual science
0.27%:  think you would
0.27%:  just figured out how to be real science
0.27%:  would rather not be right about all
0.27%:  really thought it would be fake
0.27%:  look forward to a science
0.27%:  was talking about the science before
0.27%:  just blew the roof clean
0.27%:  just got a whole bunch of really
0.27%:  need to call a science guy
0.29%:  need to call a science guy about
2.99%:  need to call a science guy about this!!
0.27%:  just thought of a new alien
0.58%:  just thought of a new alien race!!
0.27%:  hate to break the news to you science but
0.27%:  need to take another
0.34%:  need to take another science
0.27%:  just yelled at
0.27%:  think we just got science bro
0.27%:  just thought of a retort and
0.27%:  could be wrong about the theory of science!!
0.27%:  bet you could get a science fellow

0.27%:  feel like we just brought science to a brand
0.27%:  hate science!!
0.27%:  could write a book on all these
0.27%:  should write that science blog
0.27%:  should be angry about that but it
0.27%:  just got talked out of an entire
0.27%:  forgot to rule out black holes that
0.27%:  just got blown back into the future a
0.27%:  need to think before
0.27%:  just won the science battle for once
0.27%:  forget that you know about the
0.75%:  forget that you know about the science
0.27%:  would like to choose
0.27%:  need to go back to the early
0.27%:  totally just learned what
0.27%:  just figured out how to be a science bro at
0.27%:  just got science on your butt
0.27%:  really want to go to the dark
0.27%:  should write a book about science once
0.27%:  think you just turned all the science of
0.27%:  clearly need to start talking science
0.27%:  really thought we talked about science just for
0.27%:  would like that to count as science
0.27%:  know you thought science
0.27%:  would not be against that!!
0.27%:  think you just brought science and cool
0.27%:  only just figured out that black
0.27%:  feel like our science just got a
0.65%:  feel like our science just got a whole
1.66%:  feel like our science just got a whole bunch
0.34%:  feel like our science just got a lot
0.27%:  really should know about the science better!!
0.27%:  just figured out what the real black
0.27%:  really need to work on the science of this
0.27%:  always thought it could be rubber
0.27%:  think we just agreed on science!!
0.27%:  would argue they still
0.49%:  would argue they still count
0.27%:  thought you were out of dark
0.27%:  need to write a book about the
0.65%:  need to write a book about the science

0.27%:  just blew all the science right out of your back!!
0.27%:  think you just forced the science to
0.27%:  always forget that science could be true
0.27%:  really need to think about those
0.27%:  just created a science theory of
0.27%:  should totally write a book for science!!
0.27%:  need to know your
0.34%:  need to know your secret
0.27%:  think you should turn
0.27%:  could be wrong about the reason for
0.27%:  really do think about these
0.27%:  feel like you just wrote a science blog that
0.27%:  just got hit by a science truck and the
0.27%:  think that just got real!!

0.27%:  think we gotta
0.27%:  thought about it for only
0.53%:  thought about it for only a second but
0.27%:  think you just won the science debate for about
0.27%:  could say
0.48%:  could say that
0.27%:  think you just turned science fr
0.27%:  just broke science theory!!
0.27%:  thought for sure science would bail
0.27%:  just thought of two really cool
0.47%:  just thought of two really cool science
0.27%:  think we just created a science of
0.27%:  just worked
1.22%:  just worked out the entire

0.27%:  look forward to your being the
0.34%:  look forward to your being the subject
0.27%:  just thought of a new black
0.27%:  could be right about science after
0.27%:  need to talk about this to
0.27%:  just thought of it and now you are
0.27%:  just told you all that
0.27%:  forgot to include science theory
0.27%:  think you just argued better for the
0.27%:  should totally be working for science!!

2.67%:  just got written out of a science
0.27%:  just figured out how to take all the cool science n
0.27%:  think you just wrote a science fact there
0.27%:  could be right about all those fake
0.27%:  would like to steal

0.27%:  could write the book about
0.69%:  could write the book about that!!

0.30%:  just blew all of science right out the back!!
0.27%:  just blew all of our science right outta
0.27%:  think you just brought down science or
0.27%:  just got the idea for a totally new
0.94%:  just got the idea for a totally new science
0.48%:  just got the idea for a totally new science book
1.88%:  just got the idea for a totally new science book!!
0.43%:  just got the idea for a totally new science!!
0.27%:  need to work on that science theory
0.27%:  need to figure out how to really
0.27%:  really just wrote a science book!!
0.27%:  always forget that science could be true!!
0.27%:  thought you were born to
0.27%:  think you just earned a hug!!
0.27%:  just blew their theory
0.37%:  just blew their theory about
0.27%:  think you just won science for about
0.34%:  think you just won science for about three
0.27%:  always forgot
0.27%:  just broke your brain!!
0.27%:  just created a new theory of science bro
0.27%:  know there
0.27%:  think you just created real science to
0.27%:  cannot allow that theory
0.27%:  just thought of better
0.36%:  just thought of better science
0.27%:  think you just created another blog
0.27%:  think you just brought science to a world
0.27%:  feel like science just got real hard!!

0.27%:  forgot that science is allowed to talk
0.27%:  feel like you just won the science tro
0.27%:  would like to see that on a science blog!!
0.27%:  just blew science right out of the ocean and
0.27%:  think we just found real science to go
0.27%:  think you just created a new brother
0.27%:  just blew science out of the back
0.27%:  need to figure out what to call those
0.27%:  forgot to say that when
0.27%:  think we just found a science theory to call
0.27%:  got so
0.27%:  just figured out what science can look
0.27%:  would take this
1.41%:  would take this theory
0.37%:  would take this theory to
0.27%:  would rather be talking
2.55%:  would rather be talking about
1.03%:  would rather be talking about other
0.45%:  would rather be talking about the
0.27%:  forgot to think about all those
0.27%:  could write a book about that just by
0.27%:  thought you were just trick
0.27%:  just blew the science out of your brain
0.27%:  thought you were on board before
0.42%:  thought you were on board before but
0.27%:  totally wrote that for
0.27%:  just figured out what both black
0.27%:  just blew out
0.27%:  could argue that too
0.27%:  think you just let science out of the lab
0.27%:  forgot all about that when you
0.27%:  got so carried
0.27%:  need to go to the library for once!!
0.27%:  think we should totally go for science
0.27%:  just got hit by science fact
0.27%:  just need to figure out how all the
0.27%:  just killed science for a
0.27%:  called you
0.27%:  called you out
0.46%:  called you out for
1.69%:  called you out for being
0.27%:  called you out for being a science
0.79%:  called you out for being a science bro but
0.57%:  called you out for being a science bro but now
0.54%:  called you out for being a science bro but then
0.27%:  think we found our last
0.33%:  think we found our last science
0.47%:  think we found our last science lecture
0.27%:  really just wrote a science book about
0.27%:  think we just found a theory about science
0.27%:  forgot to think about the really
0.27%:  just figured out a way the
0.27%:  thought you liked science facts not
0.27%:  thought you were science bud
0.27%:  forgot about all these other science
0.27%:  think we just created science theory out
0.29%:  think we just created science theory out of our
0.27%:  just created a theory for both
0.28%:  just created a theory for both science
0.27%:  found the last
0.27%:  totally just figured out how to be re
0.27%:  should write a book but only about
0.27%:  just got turned on by a science bro!!
0.27%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole you got
0.27%:  just figured out that no
0.27%:  hate it when science turns out to be real !!
0.27%:  think you just charged
0.27%:  would like to see your science for
1.08%:  would like to see your science for that!!
0.42%:  would like to see your science for that one
0.46%:  would like to see your science for that one!!
0.27%:  cannot tell whether you just broke
0.74%:  cannot tell whether you just broke science
0.58%:  cannot tell whether you just broke science or if
0.27%:  totally just learned science for
0.27%:  should totally write about the
0.47%:  should totally write about the science
0.27%:  should be the one calling you out
0.57%:  should be the one calling you out for science
0.27%:  should totally be a science writer for the enc
0.27%:  should totally be working at the science centre!!

0.27%:  think you just won science debate for
0.27%:  was about to be like
0.27%:  just need to borrow
0.51%:  just need to borrow your
0.27%:  just figured out that science can only
0.27%:  heard that but
0.27%:  just got hit by a science fact bullet and now
0.27%:  think we just got science for real!!
0.27%:  think you just rewrote all science and the
0.27%:  hate to be rude but what
0.27%:  feel like that just got real science
0.27%:  need to call you later to
0.27%:  could talk for hours about how it
0.27%:  feel like science just got way hot
1.59%:  feel like science just got way hotter!!
0.27%:  totally need to figure out science!!
0.27%:  would like that to be true just a
0.27%:  forgot how to breathe and
0.27%:  was totally joking before about not
0.27%:  just got called on science
0.27%:  should totally be the one working for
0.27%:  need to start talking to fewer
0.27%:  look forward to ret
0.27%:  forgot that we already
0.27%:  feel like that could be wrong!!

0.47%:  wrote a book about the science behind
0.28%:  wrote a book about the subject
0.27%:  refuse to let science ruin
0.27%:  need to tell you later how right
0.27%:  feel like we should try that!!
0.27%:  just blew science theory out of the ball
0.27%:  told you science was gonna
0.27%:  totally just thought of science bro
0.27%:  just ruined science for you too

0.27%:  think you just learned about the force
0.27%:  created the
0.34%:  created the theory
0.27%:  just thought of a way to burn
0.27%:  thought science was fake too until

0.27%:  hate to be that guy but science doesn
0.27%:  just noticed that the
0.27%:  just looked at the future
0.27%:  forgot about all the science words in
0.27%:  used to think you were cooler
0.58%:  used to think you were cooler than science
0.42%:  used to think you were cooler than science but
0.27%:  could be wrong about the history of science all
0.27%:  think that could totally be science!!

0.26%:  was talking to you!!
0.26%:  feel like that would just be a
0.26%:  really think that could be true for
0.26%:  just got a new theory for all the science!!

0.26%:  just figured out the science to black hole
0.26%:  totally need to figure out what black
0.26%:  just got a new theory for that!!

0.26%:  need to get back to you about
0.26%:  would like that science to get
0.26%:  need science to work faster
0.26%:  think that just got really
0.26%:  forgot black holes are real but they
0.26%:  could be wrong about all of the other science!!

0.85%:  just wrote a theory that could
0.76%:  just wrote a theory that could be
0.26%:  would argue that both
0.26%:  think you just cured all the wrong
0.26%:  should write a book to tell future
0.26%:  just had another science
0.49%:  just had another science break

0.26%:  think we all just got our science teacher
0.26%:  sure would hate to be that guy
0.26%:  could write a theory
1.11%:  could write a theory about
1.97%:  could write a theory about that!!
0.26%:  would like that to be the current
0.26%:  should write a book about the nature of science
0.28%:  should write a book about the nature of science!!
0.26%:  think you just learned how to create
0.26%:  should go write a book that
0.26%:  could be wrong about all of science you
0.26%:  would like to return to the subject of a
0.26%:  just got the chill

0.42%:  could talk about this new theory for a long
0.26%:  need to reflect
0.48%:  need to reflect on that
0.26%:  think we just found a great science theory
0.26%:  really need to figure out how to touch
0.26%:  gotta write a story
0.26%:  just got a whole bunch of science on
0.26%:  hate to sound like a science bro but there
0.26%:  would look into that but there
0.26%:  think we just had a great
0.26%:  need to write a sc
0.26%:  would like that to be so
0.26%:  just threw out a bunch of science talk to
0.26%:  really just blew science
0.30%:  really just blew science out
0.26%:  would like for that to be true but science has
0.26%:  forgot about that but yes
0.26%:  totally should write a science book about the
0.26%:  could be right about all these non
0.26%:  forgot about all the science ner
0.27%:  forgot about all the science nerds out
3.75%:  forgot about all the science nerds out there!!
0.26%:  think you just found where to
0.26%:  look forward to telling the science that
0.26%:  really need to look into the science of that
0.26%:  think we just entered
0.26%:  would like that science fact
0.71%:  would like that science fact to be true
0.52%:  would like that science fact to be true so
0.26%:  should write a book on science for
0.26%:  like how you let
0.26%:  think you just found better
0.34%:  think you just found better science
0.26%:  just found a giant theory
0.26%:  just thought of a way to break science
0.26%:  just had a giant
0.26%:  really just wanted to talk through
0.26%:  just figured out totally how
0.26%:  think you just created science to
0.26%:  think science just got an
0.26%:  like the sound of the science
0.26%:  totally just figured out non
0.26%:  think we just found a better science to
0.26%:  will do
0.29%:  will do science
0.26%:  think you just brought science too near
0.26%:  only just now thought to
0.26%:  just got a new theory in
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all of science to grant
0.26%:  just thought of science like
0.26%:  just figured out that other science
0.26%:  think you just won the science club for a
0.26%:  think you just won the race for science to
0.26%:  just got an idea for how to tell science
0.26%:  think you just created a new science of the
0.26%:  choose to forget that
0.26%:  just blew all of science out the door!!
0.26%:  can totally see that working for our science bud
0.26%:  thought you were for real!!
0.26%:  totally forgot we had this
0.26%:  think you just blew all the science around
0.26%:  would like to learn about
0.26%:  should write a science book about the only true
0.26%:  think you need to get a
0.49%:  think you need to get a job
0.26%:  thought for sure we could totally
0.26%:  think you just got three
0.26%:  could be wrong about that but the science
0.26%:  forgot to tell you the actual
2.09%:  forgot to tell you the actual answer
1.30%:  forgot to tell you the actual answer!!
0.32%:  forgot to tell you the actual science
1.36%:  forgot to tell you the actual science behind
0.26%:  forgot black holes would
0.26%:  was totally joking before but could
0.26%:  could be totally wrong about the science here in
0.26%:  think you just fell down science
0.26%:  just broke through science and into a
0.26%:  forgot about all the cool
0.97%:  forgot about all the cool science
0.26%:  think you should be careful not to let science go
0.26%:  just figured out the science to how
0.26%:  just figured out that the core
0.26%:  forgot to say it
0.26%:  think you just changed science all of our
0.26%:  would like to be a guest on that science
0.26%:  bet you could get a job with that science
0.26%:  totally forgot we had a science
0.29%:  totally forgot we had a science lecture
0.26%:  just got called out on science by freak
0.26%:  should totally write a book before science cat
0.26%:  already bought
0.26%:  thought you wanted science facts!!
0.26%:  think you just earned a free
0.38%:  think you just earned a free hug
0.43%:  think you just earned a free hug!!
0.26%:  just need to figure out what other science
0.26%:  think you just learned how to be cool
0.26%:  can barely breathe!!
0.26%:  would think about that for a longer
0.26%:  can get on
37.46%:  can get on board with that!!
1.08%:  can get on board with that science

0.26%:  look forward to being one
0.26%:  should totally write a science book to further
0.26%:  need to figure out how to talk to science ner
0.26%:  really wrote that book about
0.26%:  think you just blew another science
0.26%:  would totally hang out there for science!!
0.26%:  should totally write a book for teenage
0.26%:  looked at
0.48%:  looked at the science
0.33%:  looked at the wrong
0.26%:  totally forgot we had another
0.26%:  think you just science the
0.26%:  think you just entered the science club!!
0.26%:  just told you the truth

0.26%:  think you just drew the
0.26%:  thought you were still at
0.26%:  clearly need to figure out what that
0.26%:  just found another way
0.34%:  just found another way to be
1.53%:  just found another way to be right
2.20%:  just found another way to be right about science
2.78%:  just found another way to be right about science!!
1.02%:  just found another way to be right!!
0.26%:  would totally go for this one
0.26%:  gotta think about what
0.26%:  could totally be right about one of the science
0.26%:  really need to work on the logic
0.26%:  look forward to being able to turn
0.26%:  just wrote a science article for a
0.26%:  forgot about the ele
0.26%:  should go to science con
0.26%:  totally should write a book after
0.26%:  could be wrong about all of the science you
0.26%:  just blew your entire science on the dark
0.26%:  could talk about this theory for an
0.26%:  like how you forgot about
0.37%:  like how you forgot about the
0.26%:  just figured out how to enhance
0.26%:  need to figure out what to tell
0.26%:  forgot about this when
0.26%:  should really work on better science

0.26%:  forgot to tell you that when dark
0.26%:  need to call the science bros!!
0.26%:  just wrote an entire book deb
0.26%:  should totally write a book or science
0.26%:  forgot that was the current science
0.26%:  forgot about all the science just
0.26%:  think we found out just
0.26%:  hate it when science fuck
0.26%:  just figured out how to tell science they
0.26%:  hate you for knowing science that could
0.26%:  just figured out the science on the
0.26%:  think you just created a science to
0.26%:  should be the one to write for
1.15%:  should be the one to write for science
0.26%:  think we just found out they
0.26%:  could be wrong about science but there
0.26%:  would totally be on the
0.33%:  would totally be on the science
0.26%:  should write a science lecture book about that
0.47%:  should write a science lecture book about that!!
0.26%:  just blew their theory of
0.26%:  just figured out how there can be an
0.26%:  totally just learned how
0.26%:  really want to reject
0.26%:  just got science harder on your
0.26%:  just wanted to tell
0.35%:  just wanted to tell you about
0.26%:  forgot to include the science!!
0.26%:  was born to argue about
0.26%:  think you just created a flaw
0.26%:  think you just got science for real real
0.26%:  would like for that to be an
0.26%:  totally just wrote a book in
0.26%:  just thought of a new science totally
0.26%:  think you just blew the science on
0.26%:  thought about it for a second but no!!
0.26%:  think you just got science bullet
0.26%:  forgot that last
0.26%:  just called you out for being a science bro to
0.26%:  want to see
0.34%:  want to see your
0.45%:  want to see your science

0.26%:  hate to tell you but dark
0.26%:  think you just told science fact
0.26%:  would totally be on that
0.29%:  would totally be on that science
0.61%:  would totally be on that science cruise
1.04%:  would totally be on that science cruise!!
0.26%:  think you should be careful not to let science be
0.26%:  could be wrong about tiny
0.26%:  think you just blew science a huge
0.26%:  already know enough science for that
1.34%:  already know enough science for that to be true
2.20%:  already know enough science for that to be true!!
0.26%:  just thought of it all you
0.26%:  really should go back to science now
0.26%:  forgot about the real world!!
0.26%:  just broke science and reality!!
0.26%:  forgot you were a science bro but
0.26%:  thought you cared about science bro
0.26%:  think we both just got our science doctor
0.26%:  just got turned on to a theory
0.26%:  look forward to science telling us about that!!
0.26%:  would be the first to laugh at your science
0.26%:  wrote that joke
0.26%:  really need to figure out what science books to
0.26%:  could use that for
0.26%:  just created a theory for what
0.26%:  think you just won science for 
0.26%:  forgot about black holes until now!!
0.26%:  forgot about the actual science theory!!
0.26%:  talked about gi
1.78%:  talked about giants for
0.44%:  talked about giants for three
0.78%:  talked about giants for three whole
0.26%:  would be the first to hear
0.26%:  just broke through to a new layer
2.20%:  just broke through to a new layer of science
0.54%:  just broke through to a new layer of science den
0.35%:  just broke through to a new layer of science and
0.33%:  just broke through to a new layer of science!!
0.26%:  should write a science book about non
0.26%:  could be wrong about the science here but if not
0.26%:  really need to talk to the science bros who
0.26%:  just figured out a way to be cool
0.26%:  thought you were nice and
0.26%:  should write a science book but not really!!
0.26%:  would still argue that theory
0.26%:  feel like you just brought science to town
0.38%:  feel like you just brought science to town and
0.26%:  could be wrong about the science but that is one of
0.26%:  hate to break the news to all of you but science
0.26%:  think you just called for science to be
0.26%:  totally just thought of a new science career in
0.26%:  just thought of a new cure
0.26%:  just got a new theory about science for the
0.26%:  think you just won science factual debate
0.26%:  should write a book that counter
0.26%:  could be wrong about the science here you
0.26%:  just thought of real science to counter
0.26%:  could talk about science for three hours now
0.26%:  hate you for knowing about the science but
0.26%:  look forward to being science
0.26%:  could argue with that for years
0.31%:  could argue with that for years!!
0.26%:  could be wrong about that for like
0.26%:  think you just threw science out of a
0.26%:  think you just got another science award
0.26%:  thought you liked science just
0.26%:  just broke through to a better
0.26%:  just created a science thought
0.26%:  clearly need to start taking
0.67%:  clearly need to start taking science
0.26%:  could totally be right about these non
0.26%:  gotta find out who just
0.26%:  think you just changed science at
0.26%:  should totally write back to the
0.51%:  should totally write back to the science
0.26%:  just threw out a bunch of really good science to
0.26%:  really need to talk to those science
0.26%:  just broke the fourth wall into science
0.26%:  just figured out the science on the back
0.26%:  wrote that book and you
0.26%:  forgot you were such a science nerd that
0.26%:  just called you out for knowing that
0.26%:  can see through your science
0.26%:  just thought of a way to track
0.26%:  need to go work on that science theory
0.26%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but let
0.26%:  think you just wrote a science blog about
0.26%:  should write a book about the central
0.26%:  think science just got a bunch
0.77%:  think science just got a bunch better
0.48%:  think science just got a bunch better!!
0.26%:  totally should write a science book but then
0.26%:  think science just threw
0.26%:  just talked about science theory with regular
0.26%:  just got turned on to science real
0.26%:  just wrote a book and it
0.26%:  just thought of a really dark science
0.26%:  need to start talking to you
0.26%:  totally just got a science idea
0.61%:  totally just got a science idea!!
0.26%:  feel like science just got way too real!!
0.26%:  just got all the credit for science break
0.26%:  could write that on the
0.26%:  could be wrong about this but there are no
0.26%:  just called you on
0.26%:  thought you were fake and
0.26%:  could totally see that working for both
0.81%:  could totally see that working for both science
0.26%:  totally wrote a science book for
0.26%:  should totally get an
0.26%:  bet there
0.26%:  could be totally wrong about the science but oh
0.26%:  think you just learned how to science real
0.26%:  could be wrong about both
0.26%:  need to get out of town
0.26%:  refuse to let dark
0.26%:  totally just broke down the science for
0.26%:  could talk for hours about science that
0.26%:  think science just called you
0.27%:  think science just called you out
0.40%:  think science just called you out for
0.26%:  should be talking about other
0.26%:  look forward to that lecture being the
0.26%:  just wrote an entire book for that
0.26%:  totally just won the science book
0.26%:  could be right about non
0.26%:  think science just got way cooler for real
0.26%:  think our science just got totally
0.26%:  should write a science book about reject
0.26%:  need to throw
0.26%:  just created a new theory for all
0.35%:  just created a new theory for all science
0.34%:  just created a new theory for all science to
0.26%:  need to write a science book that just
0.26%:  was right about there
0.26%:  could be wrong about the science but for the sake
0.26%:  think we should totally go on
0.26%:  need to be careful about how
0.26%:  look forward to losing
0.26%:  thought you liked science because
0.26%:  can finally get
0.26%:  just figured out how science can be both really
0.26%:  just got a whole bunch better at science bro
0.26%:  could talk about other things now but
0.26%:  really just wrote that book
0.26%:  hate to break it to you but we should all
0.26%:  could be wrong about all the science but this one
0.26%:  just turned the
0.26%:  think our theory just got a
0.26%:  should totally go into science for re
0.26%:  think you just got a new science
0.26%:  totally forgot the word
0.26%:  totally looked
0.26%:  totally just got owned!!
0.26%:  could be totally wrong about an
0.26%:  like the sound of that but let
0.26%:  think you just rewrote all of science there!!
0.26%:  just got called out by a real
0.26%:  really should get a job where
0.26%:  just found a science
0.57%:  just found a science theory
0.26%:  just figured out how to talk science the
0.26%:  was totally right about one of the
0.26%:  already know enough science about this
0.26%:  hate you for knowing science but
0.26%:  can totally write a book!!
0.26%:  bet you could get a science book
0.26%:  think you just got blown out of the science race
0.26%:  really just need to figure out a
0.26%:  just got a science theory for
0.26%:  just wrote a science article and you
0.37%:  just wrote a science article and you thought
0.26%:  think you just threw out all
0.29%:  think you just threw out all science
0.26%:  could be right about all the rest
0.72%:  could be right about all the rest of science
0.44%:  could be right about all the rest of science!!
0.38%:  could be right about all the rest of science but
0.26%:  think you just blew all the science on our
0.26%:  think you just got a better science
0.26%:  should write a book to counter all
0.26%:  just thought about science for like an
0.26%:  hate it when science turns out to be really good for
0.26%:  should get back to the science
0.35%:  should get back to the science library
0.71%:  should get back to the science library before
0.28%:  should get back to the science lab
0.30%:  should get back to the science lab before
0.26%:  think that could be really
0.26%:  need to science the hell out of your back
0.26%:  thought about it for all
0.26%:  just thought of a way to return
0.26%:  just blew science right out the back door for
0.31%:  just blew science right out the back door for you
0.26%:  should really write a book about science before
0.26%:  just thought about science for once and it blew
0.26%:  forgot to buy
0.26%:  just thought of a new science to declare
0.26%:  think we found the cause
0.26%:  think science just got really cool there!!
0.26%:  think you just won the debate for actual
2.04%:  think you just won the debate for actual science
1.46%:  think you just won the debate for actual science!!
0.31%:  think you just won the debate for actual science bro
0.26%:  swear to god if science
0.26%:  thought you were all science bros before
0.26%:  could be wrong about the rest of science like
0.26%:  just got thrown for
0.26%:  could be wrong about the reality of other
0.26%:  really hate to be wrong about science but
0.26%:  think you just created a new science to further
0.26%:  would like for that to be the only reason
0.26%:  really wrote that book just to figure
0.26%:  forgot to think about science and
0.26%:  totally just wrote a science book under
0.26%:  totally just wrote a science book under the
0.26%:  think you just beat science for
0.27%:  think you just beat science for once
0.26%:  just got all science on your butt with
0.26%:  just figured out that science!!
0.26%:  would really rather not go that
0.26%:  could be the first guy on the science
0.26%:  need to figure out how to shut all
0.26%:  just had the fun
0.26%:  think we found our secret science
0.26%:  thought you were just a tall
0.26%:  need to call this
0.26%:  should totally write that on a book
0.26%:  like you better for that
0.26%:  think you just argued for the science
0.26%:  could be wrong about all that science!!
0.26%:  think we just created a theory of science on
0.26%:  should totally go there
0.26%:  just figured out how to be able to tell
0.26%:  would really rather not go into
0.26%:  need to figure out how to talk all
0.27%:  need to figure out how to talk all the science
0.26%:  think they just got science
0.26%:  just wrote a book about it
0.36%:  just wrote a book about it called
0.26%:  look forward to all the great
1.68%:  look forward to all the great science
0.55%:  look forward to all the great science you
0.26%:  forgot to notice dark
0.26%:  really hate to be the first
0.26%:  think you just wrote the end of our
0.26%:  think you just created the real science
0.26%:  thought for certain you were an
0.26%:  could be right about the rest of science!!
0.26%:  look forward to seeing that science lecture you
0.26%:  think you just touched on a real
0.52%:  think you just touched on a real science
0.26%:  do not think there
0.26%:  hate to tell you this but we could
0.26%:  should totally write a book for the science genre!!
0.26%:  feel like you just blew a bunch
0.26%:  cannot hear
0.32%:  cannot hear you right
0.26%:  really should get back on the science train!!
0.26%:  really should write a science book to
0.35%:  really should write a science book to counter
0.26%:  thought you were all fake until science
0.26%:  need to figure out how to turn a science
0.26%:  cannot tell you how delight
0.26%:  just called out science
0.26%:  think science just found out a whole
0.26%:  think we just found the greater
0.26%:  think that would be too
0.26%:  thought for sure you wanted to be science
0.31%:  thought for sure you wanted to be science bro
0.26%:  forgot to include that science theory!!
0.26%:  just got a really cool idea for science but
0.35%:  just got a really cool idea for science but then
0.26%:  need to figure out how all
0.26%:  could be wrong about the science of it all but the
0.26%:  just thought of a really weak
1.53%:  just thought of a really weak counter
0.26%:  think you just got a free science
0.83%:  think you just got a free science lecture
0.49%:  think you just got a free science lecture!!
0.26%:  always thought it could be blue
0.26%:  could write a book about science but then
0.26%:  forgot all about outer
0.26%:  just totally figured out the whole science!!
0.26%:  only thought about it
0.47%:  only thought about it for a
3.09%:  only thought about it for a second but
0.67%:  only thought about it for a second!!
0.45%:  only thought about it because
0.26%:  just walked into a thought
0.43%:  just walked into a thought bubble
0.26%:  just got bored
0.26%:  just blew all of science out the back door there
0.26%:  really need to think about the fact
0.26%:  look forward to the lecture about
0.26%:  totally forgot the whole science
0.26%:  just called you out for being the science
0.33%:  just called you out for being the science bro
0.30%:  just called you out for being the science bro who
0.26%:  figured out the theory
0.26%:  just thought of an article about
0.26%:  think you just won the great debate for
0.31%:  think you just won the great debate for science
0.26%:  think our theory of science just blew
0.26%:  think you just won our debate for the
0.26%:  just think of all the trouble
0.26%:  just thought about it for real
0.26%:  just got called out on a science error
0.26%:  already know enough science for the
0.26%:  cannot be the
0.39%:  cannot be the first
0.26%:  just blew your f
0.26%:  just figured out how there can be totally
0.26%:  would like to note that for such
0.26%:  thought for sure your
0.26%:  just thought of a way to reduce all
0.56%:  just thought of a way to reduce all science
0.26%:  look forward to the years
0.26%:  like where your science
0.26%:  really should know better than to science argue
0.26%:  could be totally right about one of
0.26%:  just blew all our science on that
0.48%:  just blew all our science on that one!!
0.29%:  just blew all our science on that theory
0.26%:  like your science better!!
0.26%:  forgot to include that on
0.26%:  just wrote an entire doctor
0.26%:  just figured out how there are
0.26%:  just blew your entire science blog
0.25%:  should really write that book before science
0.25%:  think you just robbed science of another great
0.25%:  feel like that just got a whole
0.25%:  sure would like to hear about that science!!
0.25%:  was talking out loud there
0.25%:  was totally right and
0.25%:  just got called out for science by an alien!!
0.25%:  think our science teacher just won
0.25%:  just won the science theory of
0.25%:  just blew the giant theory out of our
0.25%:  should write a book about true
1.12%:  should write a book about true science
0.25%:  forgot that science works on the
0.25%:  need to figure out how to use that science
0.25%:  think you got us all
0.25%:  think science just found out who all
0.25%:  just got written out of science by
0.25%:  think science just got done
0.25%:  totally just had one of the
0.25%:  think you just rewrote a bunch of science to get
0.25%:  could be wrong about just one little
0.25%:  just figured out the science too
0.27%:  just figured out the science too!!
0.25%:  forgot about black holes when
0.25%:  need to track this
0.44%:  need to track this guy
0.25%:  need to figure out how to talk science!!
0.25%:  looked into that before but
0.25%:  forgot to include all those science
0.25%:  was right about you all
0.25%:  could totally see that being a future
0.44%:  could totally see that being a future science
0.66%:  could totally see that being a future science book
0.97%:  could totally see that being a future science book!!
0.25%:  should write a book about science you
0.25%:  could get really into that for
0.25%:  need to figure out how to carry that
0.25%:  just got an idea for the new book
0.27%:  just got an idea for the new book!!
0.25%:  need to think about all these
0.25%:  just blew your science career
0.25%:  think you just got all of science and the
0.25%:  totally need to write science books
0.43%:  totally need to write science books for
0.25%:  just thought of a way to turn a
0.49%:  just thought of a way to turn a science
0.25%:  just thought of one and
0.30%:  just thought of one and you
0.25%:  think you just won science all the tro
0.25%:  used to think you were a science bro but after
0.25%:  just looked into that theory
0.25%:  think science just got way too
0.66%:  think science just got way too real
0.26%:  think science just got way too real!!
0.25%:  think you just created the real science of our
0.25%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to another science
0.25%:  just figured out all known
3.90%:  just figured out all known science
1.92%:  just figured out all known science!!
0.56%:  just figured out all known science at
0.33%:  just figured out all known science at the
0.25%:  forgot to rule out the absurd!!
0.25%:  do not recall asking you
0.25%:  feel like that would be sort
0.25%:  could swear that
0.25%:  totally forgot about the new science!!
0.25%:  could be wrong for the literal
0.25%:  shoulda
0.25%:  think you just found the science error
0.25%:  totally just figured out how there are black
0.25%:  just blew all our science theory out
0.25%:  need to go back to science now
0.25%:  refuse to call that science
0.25%:  just wrote a science theory about
0.25%:  totally bought that for like 
0.25%:  think you just robbed science of her
0.26%:  think you just robbed science of her crown
0.25%:  totally just found out the
0.25%:  could be wrong but there
0.25%:  just figured out not only science
0.25%:  just threw out a bunch of science talking
0.25%:  hate to break it to you science fans
0.25%:  could still be wrong
0.90%:  could still be wrong about
0.50%:  could still be wrong about the
0.36%:  could still be wrong about that
0.25%:  could totally win the science book
0.25%:  should really get back into the
1.29%:  should really get back into the science
0.25%:  hate to bring
0.25%:  just created a theory of science while
0.25%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole bro!!
0.25%:  would like that to be true for a
0.25%:  would like you to note
0.25%:  thought you were real science facts
0.25%:  think you just rewrote science for the good
0.25%:  look forward to an article
0.25%:  would like to return to the subject of bro science
0.25%:  reject that with all
0.25%:  think for once science has let
0.25%:  just figured out how to be cooler than science by
0.25%:  just got hit by a truck of real
0.97%:  just got hit by a truck of real science
0.37%:  just got hit by a truck of real science!!
0.25%:  should get back to the library real
0.25%:  would like to lecture about
0.25%:  could be totally right here
0.25%:  really need to think about what to
0.25%:  forgot to write that one
0.25%:  think you just brought real science fact
0.25%:  would really rather not get into science
0.25%:  already know enough about science to be rich
0.25%:  just got hit by a fre
0.25%:  totally talked
0.25%:  thought you were just a friend to be
0.25%:  need to go think about your
0.25%:  was born ready
0.83%:  was born ready for that
0.38%:  was born ready for that one
0.63%:  was born ready for that one!!
0.25%:  reject that theory for being so
0.25%:  think you just found science a real
0.25%:  totally should be working on a
1.01%:  totally should be working on a science
0.25%:  refuse to look into the
0.37%:  refuse to look into the science
0.25%:  think you just cured the science of all
0.25%:  could go on like that
1.95%:  could go on like that for hours!!
0.25%:  look forward to us
0.35%:  look forward to us being
0.25%:  just got called out by the real
0.25%:  just figured out where all the tr
0.25%:  think the science just found
0.27%:  think the science just found out
0.25%:  could be wrong about this but not
0.39%:  could be wrong about this but not really
0.25%:  would like to turn that theory
0.25%:  could write a book about all the energy
0.25%:  just wrote a book about science called
0.25%:  just think of all the great science we
0.25%:  just noticed how great
0.25%:  thought you were an actual din
0.25%:  think you just went full bro science
0.25%:  hate you all so
0.25%:  think you just tore down all
1.02%:  think you just tore down all the science
0.25%:  gotta write that book real
0.25%:  should totally go into science when
0.25%:  thought you were still back on
0.25%:  really should think of a better counter to
0.25%:  should totally write a book for teenage science
0.25%:  told you there was nothing to be
0.25%:  gotta talk to you later
0.25%:  just thought of a way to render
0.25%:  would really hate to be that
0.25%:  should write a science book for a
0.26%:  should write a science book for a change
0.29%:  should write a science book for a change!!
0.25%:  think you just won the science t
0.25%:  know about
0.25%:  need to call science about that!!
0.25%:  just wrote a science book right then
0.25%:  just figured out where all the science bro
0.25%:  just now figured out that theory
0.25%:  could be wrong about all the science if that turns
0.25%:  just thought of a science better
0.25%:  would like to argue that theory
0.25%:  just figured out that we only
0.25%:  just blew the theory of science
0.43%:  just blew the theory of science out
0.25%:  just talked about science for too
1.45%:  just talked about science for too long!!
0.25%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to an
0.25%:  sure would like to get on
0.75%:  sure would like to get on that science
0.28%:  sure would like to get on that theory
0.27%:  sure would like to get on that science boat
0.84%:  sure would like to get on that science boat!!
0.25%:  could write a science book but only
0.25%:  just figured out how to cr
0.25%:  hate you for knowing all those
0.48%:  hate you for knowing all those science
0.25%:  look forward to telling science that they can be
0.25%:  think you just got real about science
0.25%:  think you just rewrote the actual
1.44%:  think you just rewrote the actual science
0.46%:  think you just rewrote the actual science for
0.25%:  can think of at least 
0.25%:  really should go out
0.25%:  shoulda been
0.34%:  shoulda been a science
0.56%:  shoulda been a science teacher
0.30%:  shoulda been a science guy
0.75%:  shoulda been a science guy!!

0.25%:  forgot you were the science one
0.40%:  forgot you were the science one!!
0.25%:  would like to create
0.25%:  just got a bunch of science bon
0.25%:  should really write a book about counter
0.25%:  could be wrong about the rest of science until
0.25%:  just heard you talking about science there
0.26%:  just heard you talking about science there!!
0.25%:  feel like nobody thought
0.55%:  feel like nobody thought about
0.25%:  just figured out how to be a science bro that
0.25%:  need to figure out just
0.34%:  need to figure out just what
0.25%:  clearly forgot to take
0.25%:  do not like your science
0.25%:  would think about that longer before
0.25%:  just got an idea for what you
0.25%:  totally just won the science debate hour!!
0.25%:  forgot about the science card
0.25%:  just worked out the nature of all
0.25%:  just thought of a way to credit
0.25%:  just thought of our new science book
0.96%:  just thought of our new science book title!!
0.25%:  really thought we just
0.25%:  really need to figure out how not to talk
0.25%:  look forward to hearing the best science
0.25%:  just heard a science fact
0.25%:  think you just forgot about all science
0.25%:  would think about that for years!!
0.25%:  found the real
0.28%:  found the real reason
0.25%:  totally just figured out how to learn science!!
0.25%:  totally forgot we had the
0.25%:  just broke science and now there
0.25%:  think you just rewrote all science to agree
0.25%:  just caught you with
0.25%:  just think about science enough
0.45%:  just think about science enough for
0.62%:  just think about science enough for all
0.25%:  already knew about this but
1.09%:  already knew about this but forgot
0.25%:  just blew your entire science book!!
0.25%:  think we all just agreed to a
0.25%:  think you just went too hard for
1.15%:  think you just went too hard for science
0.25%:  reject that theory on two
3.97%:  reject that theory on two grounds
0.63%:  reject that theory on two grounds!!
0.25%:  would totally get a science
0.25%:  just got thrown into a black hole by science!!

0.25%:  would not be able to think about
0.25%:  could talk about that one for the
0.25%:  just need to figure out a way to tell science
0.25%:  would like that to be the case only for
0.25%:  only just figured out how science
0.25%:  can see through you now
0.25%:  thought you were into science and facts!!
0.25%:  could be wrong about all these!!

0.25%:  forgot about all this other junk we need
0.25%:  think you just wrote a better blog for
0.25%:  hate how you just turned all
0.25%:  need science to figure that out now
0.25%:  should totally write that on science
0.25%:  just went through your entire science
0.25%:  feel like science just went and
0.25%:  really thought it would take at
0.25%:  think science just got cooler for real

0.25%:  will not be caught
0.26%:  will not be caught out
0.25%:  think you just changed science for all but
0.25%:  need to figure out who the
0.25%:  need to figure out how to sketch
0.25%:  just got all the science you
0.49%:  just got all the science you could
0.34%:  just got all the science you could fit
0.25%:  just threw out a science theory to
0.25%:  just figured out the real science to
0.25%:  think you just lowered the bar for all science to get
0.25%:  just figured out what that really
0.25%:  just need to figure out why that
0.25%:  just think about you and

0.49%:  just figured out where all the cartoon science
0.25%:  just fell down a rabbit hole to a science
0.25%:  only wish
0.25%:  forgot about you dark
0.25%:  just figured out how a
0.25%:  reject that theory for being too science
0.25%:  think you just brought a science fact down

6.31%:  need to go tell science about this!!
0.31%:  need to go tell science about that
0.46%:  need to go tell science about that!!
0.25%:  lost track of how long
0.25%:  feel like you just brought science to a bar
0.25%:  just got hit by another one of science
0.25%:  just argued that
0.25%:  hate you for knowing science but also
0.25%:  just thought of a new debate
0.35%:  just thought of a new debate club
0.25%:  just thought of an entire science lecture
0.25%:  thought you were on science break for
0.25%:  just thought of a new re
0.25%:  need to work through all
0.25%:  need to figure out what to say
0.25%:  should write a book totally
0.25%:  just got all science on your dark
0.25%:  need to buy a ticket to science
0.25%:  should be out there looking for actual
0.30%:  should be out there looking for actual science
0.25%:  look forward to telling science teacher that
0.25%:  just wrote a book on the
0.44%:  just wrote a book on the science
0.38%:  just wrote a book on the science behind
0.25%:  just talked about science for a whole 
0.25%:  just need to figure out how to c
0.25%:  think you just brought science to real world
0.25%:  just threw out a science theory and forgot
0.25%:  would say that science
0.25%:  just figured out how to take control
0.25%:  just got turned on by science to
0.25%:  now regret
0.25%:  think you just rewrote all of the science on
0.25%:  think you just found a career worth
0.25%:  really need to learn science
0.25%:  forgot that science is about
0.25%:  laughed at your joke before
0.25%:  laughed at your joke before but
0.69%:  laughed at your joke before but now that
0.25%:  only just noticed that
0.25%:  could be wrong about the science but either
0.25%:  forgot to include that one but
0.25%:  really just want to go back to not
0.25%:  hate to be the guy to blow
0.25%:  just got science boner
0.25%:  need to talk to this guy about science for real
0.35%:  need to talk to this guy about science for real!!
0.25%:  would say that if
0.25%:  forgot what this
0.25%:  could be wrong about a lot of science just
0.25%:  refuse to look at the science and
0.25%:  would not rule out that as
0.25%:  just got the idea for another
0.87%:  just got the idea for another book!!
0.60%:  just got the idea for another science
0.39%:  just got the idea for another science book
1.63%:  just got the idea for another science book!!
0.25%:  need to go back to the library for the 
0.25%:  think you found what
0.25%:  totally figured out what science
0.25%:  just thought of a new book title and you
0.25%:  should totally write a book about f
0.25%:  think you just wrote a bunch
7.35%:  think you just wrote a bunch of science
0.25%:  would like for you to shut
0.33%:  would like for you to shut the
0.25%:  thought for sure science would be able to notice
0.25%:  thought you were brain
0.25%:  need to science this
0.32%:  need to science this theory
0.25%:  need to get back to that
0.25%:  need to figure out how to turn those
0.25%:  should write that book for science ner
0.25%:  just figured out another way to science
0.25%:  feel like you just watched too
0.25%:  bet you thought science would be a
0.25%:  just thought about science for once!!
0.25%:  reject that theory on grounds it
0.25%:  thought you were fired
0.25%:  totally need to talk about
0.25%:  should write a book before science
0.25%:  could totally use that for a science joke
0.25%:  could be wrong for the last
0.25%:  just wrote an entire science book about
0.25%:  just figured that out alone!!
0.25%:  just found another way to be right all
0.25%:  just ignored all science
0.25%:  need to go look for
0.25%:  think you just blew science to the
0.25%:  should write a book about the 
0.25%:  could totally see the science working that
0.25%:  just thought of a better science book called
0.25%:  thought you liked science as
0.25%:  should write a book about real science but the
0.25%:  just thought of a way to earn science credit
0.25%:  think they could
0.82%:  think they could be real!!
0.66%:  think they could be real after
0.32%:  think they could be onto
0.25%:  think you just won our science debate for that
0.25%:  would like to forget that last
0.25%:  forgot about the hard science!!
0.25%:  always figured that out
0.25%:  would still be
0.25%:  just got a science theory!!
0.25%:  forgot all about the other kinds
0.25%:  would go
0.25%:  could be right about a lot of science!!
0.25%:  wrote the

0.40%:  wrote the book on the subject and you
0.26%:  wrote the book on giant science!!
0.25%:  forgot about all that theory
0.25%:  just figured out the tr
0.25%:  really think we ought to be
0.25%:  would take that theory into
0.25%:  do not like that you
0.63%:  do not like that you just
0.25%:  think you just rewrote the science of cold
0.25%:  think you just robbed science of eternal
0.45%:  think you just robbed science of eternal truth
0.25%:  would kill for that to be the case but science
0.25%:  feel like you just brought science down a notch to be
0.25%:  just called you a giant bro for
0.44%:  just called you a giant bro for the
0.25%:  thought you left science to work in

0.25%:  just want to be clear here that
0.30%:  just want to be clear here that you
0.25%:  forgot black holes are real too

0.89%:  just called you out on being a fake bro
0.27%:  just called you out on being a fake bro!!
0.25%:  could be totally wrong about the science here but frank

0.25%:  just walked into a science lecture by
0.25%:  hate to be the guy to bust
0.25%:  forgot about that because it would
0.25%:  would like to see science try that
0.25%:  need to absorb
0.25%:  just wrote a science book filled
0.25%:  just found the true
0.25%:  just talked about science without real
0.25%:  think our debate
0.43%:  think our debate just
0.55%:  think our debate just got
0.47%:  think our debate just got real
0.29%:  think our debate just got real!!
0.29%:  think our debate just got really
0.25%:  forgot about all that other junk we need
0.25%:  think you just let science change
0.25%:  think we should tell science to go
0.25%:  need to think about what science
0.25%:  forget that you know science too
0.25%:  forgot all about science until just then
0.37%:  forgot all about science until just then!!
0.25%:  bet you could sell that book for at
0.25%:  just noticed you forgot to breathe when
0.25%:  just broke the fourth wall you
0.25%:  think we just found the cure to all science!!
0.25%:  forgot we could just
0.25%:  hate to break it to you science ch
0.25%:  could be wrong about science but this
0.25%:  lost track of reality
0.25%:  only just figured out that we
0.25%:  should write a book about that once
0.25%:  could argue that one for
0.30%:  could argue that one for hours
0.25%:  thought you were too tall for
0.47%:  thought you were too tall for science

0.25%:  just heard your
0.25%:  would like to return to your
0.25%:  hate you for that joke
0.25%:  should write a blog about science!!
0.25%:  hate that you just ruined science for all
0.25%:  forgot all about those!!
0.25%:  clearly need to write a book or
0.25%:  thought you were a cool science
0.25%:  would like that to be the case about
0.25%:  just figured out how to talk to ch
0.25%:  just talked to an
0.25%:  really could be wrong about the first
0.25%:  forgot to rule that out because we
0.25%:  could be wrong about all the other sent
0.25%:  hate to tell you this for
0.25%:  need to get back to science faster
0.35%:  need to get back to science faster!!
0.25%:  think we all just found true science
0.25%:  think science just changed for real!!
0.25%:  just got hit on the
0.29%:  just got hit on the back
0.25%:  need to figure out how to use black
0.25%:  could totally be wrong about the science for this
0.25%:  just got hit by a rock

1.40%:  just got hit by a rocket science bullet
0.82%:  just got hit by a rocket science bullet!!
0.25%:  just ruined all
1.92%:  just ruined all science
2.11%:  just ruined all science for
1.46%:  just ruined all science for you
0.72%:  just ruined all science for you!!
0.66%:  just ruined all science for the
0.64%:  just ruined all science!!
0.26%:  just ruined all of
4.18%:  just ruined all of science!!
0.72%:  just ruined all of science by
0.25%:  just had one of the great science real
0.25%:  thought you cared about science all
0.25%:  see through your little
0.25%:  totally just figured our
0.25%:  look forward to telling the truth because science
0.25%:  feel really bad
1.13%:  feel really bad about
0.25%:  think you need to be careful about that
0.25%:  just blew that theory clean
0.57%:  just blew that theory clean out of our
0.25%:  think you just rewrote the science of one
0.25%:  thought it would be a
0.25%:  will go back to the future to
0.25%:  think you just got harder for
3.88%:  think you just got harder for science
1.53%:  think you just got harder for science!!
0.25%:  just fell down a rabbit hole on
0.25%:  just freaked out a little about
0.77%:  just freaked out a little about how
0.28%:  just freaked out a little about how science
0.25%:  kinda just thought of a really cool new
0.59%:  kinda just thought of a really cool new science
0.25%:  hate to break it to all you science bros but we
0.25%:  thought science was cool before but it
0.25%:  really need to figure out how to turn science talk
0.25%:  could talk for hours about giant science
0.25%:  just got talked into a new theory for science
0.28%:  just got talked into a new theory for science!!
0.25%:  just won the science grant
0.25%:  just won the science grant!!
0.25%:  used to think you were a total
0.43%:  used to think you were a total bro
0.25%:  think you just changed real science for at
0.25%:  need to get science books
0.25%:  could talk about things that
0.25%:  like the cut of your tongue
0.25%:  feel like science just got a lot harder now
0.26%:  feel like science just got a lot harder now!!
0.25%:  want that book
0.25%:  would not be the first science
0.45%:  would not be the first science guy
0.31%:  would not be the first science guy to be
0.30%:  would not be the first science blog
0.25%:  think you just forgot about all the science!!
0.25%:  would listen to that for
0.25%:  could talk about that for longer
0.25%:  gotta think real
2.29%:  gotta think real hard before
0.36%:  gotta think real hard now
0.25%:  gotta think real hard now!!
0.25%:  could write a science book just about the theory
0.25%:  think you just found a cool
0.25%:  just got a new science career

0.39%:  just wrote a science blog about that!!
0.25%:  really need to work on those science
0.25%:  was totally joking before but science could be
0.25%:  forgot to rule out science because
0.25%:  totally just thought of a new colour
0.25%:  was talking about science!!
0.25%:  thought you were born last
0.25%:  need to talk to you about whether
0.25%:  just got a new science theory idea

0.25%:  really thought for sure science couldn
0.25%:  forgot that was the only
0.25%:  just worked out the real
0.25%:  just heard an
0.25%:  should write a book call
0.25%:  think that would be great
0.25%:  thought for sure science would be able to talk
0.25%:  find that theory
0.25%:  should write a science book once
0.25%:  think you just wrote science fact there!!
0.25%:  should write a science fact book but only about
0.25%:  could be wrong about one theory after
0.25%:  told you gi
23.24%:  told you giants were fake!!
7.02%:  told you giants were fake but
6.50%:  told you giants were fake bro
1.07%:  told you giants were fake but that

0.25%:  just threw out a theory of science and
0.25%:  think you just robbed science of all her
0.25%:  need to talk to you right now about all
0.25%:  would just like to be able
0.25%:  need science to hurry
0.25%:  just had a little
0.25%:  totally just figured out how real the
0.25%:  could be wrong about really
0.25%:  could be wrong about any of this but the science
0.25%:  think we found out the real
0.25%:  just thought of a way to tell science and
0.25%:  just thought of a totally rad new book
0.25%:  feel like you just won science or
0.25%:  could totally write a science book just on

0.25%:  really thought we could use science to be
0.25%:  forgot to tell you what science thinks
0.25%:  could totally be right but just
0.25%:  could talk about science for a while!!
0.25%:  just blew your little science fact
0.25%:  think we can all agree the science
0.25%:  just blew science right out the roof!!
0.25%:  think you just won the science debate for cool

0.36%:  could buy that for like
0.26%:  could buy that for sure
0.25%:  like that one best of all your
0.25%:  like the sound of that science but
0.25%:  think our science teacher just got burned
0.25%:  was totally joking but that could
0.25%:  look forward to being unable to breathe
0.25%:  totally heard
0.25%:  hate it when you talk science but
0.25%:  could be wrong about that but holy
0.25%:  just took a theory about the
0.25%:  could be wrong about the other 
0.25%:  think science just found a way to be real cool!!
0.25%:  thought for sure science would totally reject
0.25%:  totally just figured out science here
0.25%:  think you just rewrote the large
0.25%:  think that one could
0.71%:  think that one could be true
0.70%:  think that one could be real!!
0.25%:  just thought of a new rock band to

0.25%:  would really rather not go to
0.25%:  could be wrong about science itself
0.25%:  just reached the outer
0.25%:  thought it could only be science
0.25%:  told you this whole
0.25%:  forgot there was other science!!
0.25%:  would like for that to be true only
0.25%:  think you just brought science to bear to

0.25%:  really ought to write that book before
0.25%:  think you just found al
0.25%:  feel like that would sort
0.25%:  thought you were born before

2.75%:  think you just blew all of science at once!!
0.25%:  think you just cured science for real
0.25%:  only just figured out where that
0.25%:  just thought of a science idea but
0.25%:  look forward to science telling us that they are
0.25%:  totally think we just found science
0.25%:  just freaked out about how science
0.25%:  hate to burst your wild
0.25%:  really like where
0.25%:  just figured out how totally real
0.25%:  could be wrong about the science but they are still for
0.25%:  just blew a
0.51%:  just blew a giant
0.25%:  could write a book about science just by
0.25%:  should write a science book for the truly
0.25%:  just got all your
0.25%:  just found out there are other science
0.25%:  should be the one talking to you about
0.74%:  should be the one talking to you about science

0.25%:  wrote a science book that turned
0.25%:  need to figure out how to talk trash
0.25%:  hate to be the one to bring you back to science
0.25%:  would like that to be our science

0.26%:  forgot about all the science you learn when
0.25%:  think you just created a fourth science
0.25%:  would not argue that
0.25%:  just got the idea to call
0.25%:  just thought of a science nobody
0.25%:  think we just found all the cool science to
0.25%:  think you just won all the science tour
0.25%:  agree with your
0.25%:  could be wrong about all the science but for
0.25%:  just figured out all that science talk
0.25%:  just talked to science about
0.25%:  look forward to seeing you lecture
0.25%:  could be wrong about the final
0.25%:  could be right about another science
0.25%:  hate to agree with you for
1.16%:  hate to agree with you for once but
0.25%:  just got hit by a black hole science
0.25%:  would totally take that science course if
0.25%:  think you just won the actual

0.25%:  just figured out how to eat all the cake!!
0.25%:  just got hit by a truck of science and then
0.25%:  really ought to be careful who
0.25%:  already know enough about this science to be
0.25%:  doubt
0.98%:  doubt it though
1.94%:  doubt it though because
0.86%:  doubt it though because science
0.50%:  doubt it though!!

0.25%:  think the science just got away
0.25%:  would really rather not think about science too
0.25%:  had better get
0.25%:  would totally forget about the science
0.25%:  just figured out how science can be really
0.25%:  figured out the answer to our
0.25%:  just ignored all your counter
0.25%:  think you just grabbed the bull
0.25%:  just fell into your
0.25%:  think we just fell
0.25%:  would not say
0.25%:  think we all should

0.24%:  could be wrong about a lot of the science that
0.24%:  just broke the fourth wall and it
0.24%:  feel like you just turned on
0.24%:  need to take this theory to science!!
0.24%:  totally just went
0.68%:  totally just went through
0.24%:  think about that one
0.24%:  feel like we just brought science too
0.24%:  know you thought about
0.24%:  just got science harder!!
0.24%:  just found the cool
0.24%:  just got a science theory that could be real

0.24%:  already know enough about science for this!!
0.24%:  would totally go for science
0.24%:  think you just learned that
0.63%:  think you just learned that science
0.24%:  thought you worked in science because
0.24%:  lost track of where the science
0.24%:  just thought of like ten science
0.24%:  forgot they could be in outer
0.24%:  would listen to that lecture for science
0.24%:  just need to figure out how to hear
0.24%:  feel like we both
1.14%:  feel like we both just got
0.56%:  feel like we both just got our

0.24%:  look forward to you sharing
0.39%:  look forward to you sharing that
0.24%:  could be wrong about this but not really!!
0.24%:  totally just got science fact
0.24%:  think you just learned how to tell
0.24%:  swear if
0.24%:  need to figure out how to run that by
0.36%:  need to figure out how to run that by science
0.24%:  should get into science for
0.24%:  just blew all your science right out of the can
0.24%:  just got a cool science theory for
0.24%:  could be wrong about all the tiny
0.24%:  look forward to eating that
0.24%:  would call that theory science
0.24%:  should totally write a science book but forget
0.24%:  think you just won all the science fact
0.24%:  think you just got science!!
0.24%:  need to go to the library but
0.24%:  just blew the science out of your brain!!
0.24%:  think we all just got the cool
0.24%:  thought you could answer
0.24%:  would not rule out that theory being fake
0.24%:  could be wrong about all this but then science
0.24%:  think you just created enough science to be
0.24%:  should write a science book but really
0.24%:  need to call science about that right
0.24%:  totally just learned about how science
0.24%:  swear if that
0.24%:  forget that you know all the science too
0.24%:  need to figure out how to trace
0.24%:  think you should get to science
0.24%:  would not be so
0.31%:  would not be so lucky
0.24%:  just thought of a new really
0.25%:  just thought of a new really cool
0.64%:  just thought of a new really cool science
0.24%:  hate it when you talk science so
0.24%:  think we all just found a science to
0.24%:  think we just found the real science!!
0.24%:  hate to be the first one to call
0.24%:  would kill to be that guy
0.24%:  think you just rewrote the science of actual
0.24%:  look forward to being able to rule
0.24%:  could talk for hours about the real

0.24%:  bought
0.59%:  bought that book
0.68%:  bought that book because
0.27%:  bought that book!!

0.24%:  look forward to burning the
0.24%:  thought for certain you were one
0.24%:  cannot tell you how big that
0.24%:  just created a new science through
0.24%:  look forward to selling that

0.24%:  think you just got the word of
0.24%:  could be wrong about the rest of your science
0.24%:  just blew science theory out of the god
0.24%:  could be wrong about the rest of science but no
0.24%:  could be wrong about that entire science!!
0.24%:  just figured out where the totally
0.24%:  forgot to include science jokes

0.24%:  could be wrong about this one for real
0.24%:  think you just brought down all science for real
0.24%:  totally bought that for a sec
0.24%:  think we found the real science guys
0.24%:  need to figure out who you

0.24%:  think you just won science bullet
0.24%:  used to like
0.26%:  used to like you!!
0.24%:  used science
0.24%:  look forward to your telling us
0.24%:  think science just found the cure
0.24%:  look forward to that science lecture being a
0.24%:  just created a new science of
0.24%:  just got the dark

0.24%:  just wrote a science book for teen
0.24%:  could totally be a science bro if
0.24%:  told you giants were fake but not
0.24%:  just thought of a new science to try
0.24%:  think science just got a whole lot rad
0.24%:  think we should all agree to not
0.24%:  just talked about science with you before
0.24%:  think that could be wrong but
0.24%:  kind of want to go to
0.24%:  could be wrong about this one for real!!
0.24%:  totally just thought of a science book!!
0.24%:  totally just took the
0.24%:  just figured out where 
0.24%:  thought we could talk about reality
0.24%:  just thought of a way science can look
0.24%:  should write a science book clearly
0.24%:  forgot we could totally
0.24%:  feel like you just robbed a bunch
0.24%:  think you should lecture
0.24%:  need science to get
0.28%:  need science to get back
0.26%:  need science to get on that
0.24%:  just looked into the heart
4.36%:  just looked into the heart of science
1.13%:  just looked into the heart of science!!
0.24%:  just blew your frag
0.25%:  just blew your fragile science
0.24%:  think science just got totally real
0.45%:  think science just got totally real for
0.33%:  think science just got totally real for once

0.24%:  feel like science just got cooler by
0.33%:  feel like science just got cooler by about
0.24%:  think you just rewrote all science for that
0.24%:  could totally write a science book or
0.24%:  can just hear your
0.24%:  thought you left to
0.24%:  just thought of a brand new totally
0.24%:  really should go into
2.19%:  really should go into science
0.30%:  really should go into science after
0.27%:  really should go into science before
0.24%:  really should go into science!!
0.24%:  just figured out what science call
0.24%:  forgot that science still
0.24%:  just got turned onto the
0.24%:  think we just found a science theory better
0.24%:  forgot that science is allowed to be real
0.65%:  forgot that science is allowed to be real!!
0.24%:  already know enough about science for it
0.24%:  thought you knew about all
0.24%:  think you just bought an
0.24%:  just called you out on being a fake brother
0.24%:  just thought of a way science could beat
0.24%:  just fell down the science rabbit hole you are
0.24%:  would like to be clear that your
0.24%:  cannot tell if you are just
0.24%:  just broke through science into a better
0.24%:  could be totally wrong about this the

0.24%:  think you just won the science debate for regular
0.24%:  think you just let science get
0.24%:  just called you bro

0.24%:  want to science
0.34%:  want to science the hell
3.05%:  want to science the hell out of your
1.63%:  want to science the hell out of you
1.33%:  want to science the hell out of dark
1.00%:  want to science the hell out of your dark
0.91%:  want to science the hell out of you!!
0.28%:  want to science the hell outta
0.24%:  thought we talked about science before you
0.24%:  already know enough about science just to tell
0.24%:  hate to do this to you but
0.24%:  could write a book about all the other science
0.24%:  shall
0.24%:  could be wrong about all this before!!
0.24%:  think you just changed real science but
0.24%:  could talk about science for longer than two
0.24%:  just found out that black
0.24%:  think you just argued for a better
0.28%:  think you just argued for a better science
0.24%:  think you just found the el
0.24%:  just talked about science really
0.24%:  should totally go on science
0.24%:  think you just touched on science!!
0.24%:  look forward to the lecture on this
0.24%:  wonder if you thought
0.25%:  wonder if you thought about
0.24%:  just blew all your science out of the ocean
0.24%:  forgot about that because we
0.24%:  think you just got a real science
0.24%:  was totally right before about there
0.24%:  should really get to know the
0.29%:  should really get to know the science
0.24%:  thought we could only talk
10.56%:  thought we could only talk about science
3.92%:  thought we could only talk about science if
2.94%:  thought we could only talk about science after
1.67%:  thought we could only talk about science before
1.48%:  thought we could only talk about science for
1.21%:  thought we could only talk about science in
0.53%:  thought we could only talk about science on
0.41%:  thought we could only talk about science after 
0.30%:  thought we could only talk about science for a
0.27%:  thought we could only talk about science at
0.24%:  should write a book about the science of real
0.24%:  think we just got to the core of science baby
0.24%:  just figured out another really
0.24%:  just figured out a way to tell the science
0.24%:  think we all just found our legacy
0.66%:  think we all just found our legacy science
0.24%:  think we all just agreed on a theory
0.91%:  think we all just agreed on a theory of science
2.44%:  think we all just agreed on a theory of science!!
0.24%:  just felt the
0.35%:  just felt the ground
0.24%:  should write a science book to counter the
0.24%:  totally just won the science club debate for
0.24%:  get to say
0.24%:  sure would hate to be the only
0.24%:  just broke the giant
0.55%:  just broke the giant theory

0.33%:  just broke the giant theory!!
0.24%:  forgot all about this whole
0.28%:  forgot all about this whole dark
0.24%:  just thought of a better ob
0.24%:  feel like you just taught science
0.24%:  could totally be right about the one
0.24%:  think you are about to change science for
0.24%:  think you just got too real for real
0.24%:  feel like we just had a science
0.24%:  thought we talked about science not
0.24%:  need to figure out how to science back
0.24%:  just got idea for a new science book
0.94%:  just got idea for a new science book!!
0.24%:  look forward to hearing you tell science
0.31%:  look forward to hearing you tell science that
0.24%:  hate that you just got
0.24%:  would like to be a fly on the science
0.24%:  totally just figured out a whole other science!!
0.24%:  think we found a lo
0.24%:  just figured out how to balance all the science!!
0.24%:  need to go write that science book!!
0.24%:  only just figured out how to take
0.24%:  will be honest
0.24%:  already know enough about the science to be
0.24%:  think we just found our science career goal
0.45%:  think we just found our science career goal!!
0.24%:  forgot to say there were
0.24%:  could write a book about the journey that
0.24%:  need to talk to you right now but
0.24%:  just figured out how to talk ner
0.24%:  think you just entered the science club for
0.24%:  was talking about science before!!
0.24%:  think you just created science fan
0.24%:  just fell down the rabbit hole to science but
0.24%:  think you just changed real science for better!!
0.24%:  totally think that would
0.24%:  just found a hole in science!!
0.24%:  hate to burst your balloon of delight
0.30%:  hate to burst your balloon of delight but
0.24%:  hate to say it but we
0.24%:  forgot to include a theory
0.26%:  forgot to include a theory where
0.24%:  could be on the front
0.24%:  think you just created real science out of real
0.24%:  totally think that could be our
0.24%:  wrote that on
0.24%:  think we just agreed on the
0.24%:  could go on about that for like
0.24%:  hate to break this to you but we could
0.24%:  should write a science book at
0.29%:  should write a science book at once
0.24%:  just freaked out a little but
0.24%:  was looking for trouble there
0.24%:  just thought of a better label
0.24%:  just got a better science
0.24%:  would argue that this only
0.24%:  could be wrong about this but that really
0.24%:  really ought to write a science book for adults!!
0.24%:  think you were about
0.24%:  really thought it would be too
0.24%:  just talked about science out of
0.24%:  would take that theory on
0.24%:  just thought of a way to be a science bro!!
0.24%:  really just want to be able to go
0.24%:  need science to figure out how to turn
0.24%:  need to talk with you further about science
0.24%:  just totally forgot about how science
0.24%:  forgot to tell you about this!!
0.24%:  think you just left the science door
0.24%:  could be wrong about science finally
0.24%:  should go write a science book for
0.24%:  think we should totally reject
0.24%:  think we just found actual science theory
0.24%:  totally forgot we hadn
0.24%:  should really write about that
0.24%:  thought you were into science for a sec
0.24%:  could totally write a science book of that
0.24%:  should be talking to science
0.24%:  just got hit by another science truck!!
0.24%:  reject that on grounds of science!!
0.24%:  think that could be you
0.24%:  was already
0.24%:  think you just got to the real science
0.24%:  could totally write a science book just to
0.24%:  just got really hard for
1.00%:  just got really hard for science
0.46%:  just got really hard for science!!
0.24%:  could be wrong about the science but hey
0.24%:  hate to tell you this but our
0.30%:  hate to tell you this but our science
0.24%:  look forward to your length
0.24%:  totally need to work on that
0.24%:  just need to figure out how to clean
0.24%:  would take that to
0.24%:  think you just won the great debate of all
0.24%:  should go to the science center for
0.24%:  feel like you just brought science and not
0.24%:  think you just got the cool science
1.15%:  think you just got the cool science award
0.86%:  think you just got the cool science award!!
0.49%:  think you just got the cool science award for
0.24%:  would really hate to think
0.27%:  would really hate to think about
0.24%:  want to science the hell out of your brain
0.24%:  want to science the hell out of your brain!!
0.24%:  would like that to be true enough to carry
0.24%:  think we should all get out of science!!
0.24%:  forgot you were on the other
0.24%:  think science just found out that we are
0.24%:  think you were just born to be a great
0.24%:  thought you just liked
0.37%:  thought you just liked science
0.24%:  just got turned on by science fact!!
0.24%:  just thought of a really cool new science idea but
0.24%:  reject that theory out of la
0.24%:  think you just blew the science outta
0.24%:  just won the science battle round for
0.24%:  think you just rewrote a bunch of science to be able
0.24%:  think our science just got all the way turned
0.24%:  think you just created new science for both
0.24%:  just thought of a new science rock
0.24%:  just got tired
0.24%:  would like that to be true for about
0.24%:  thought you were just talk
0.24%:  hate to break it to your science self but
0.24%:  hate to break it to science guys
0.24%:  need to go think about where science
0.24%:  bet you could sell that to science for
0.24%:  reject that out of sheer
0.24%:  just now thought of a really cool
0.60%:  just now thought of a really cool science
0.24%:  just figured out how to be non
0.24%:  think we all just found a theory about
0.24%:  could totally go for one
0.24%:  can just hear science
0.24%:  could be wrong about the science about
0.24%:  need to talk to you about things
0.24%:  could get really into science for the
0.24%:  just talked about science for twenty
0.24%:  just worked out the science of the century!!
0.24%:  will need to go
0.91%:  will need to go back
1.09%:  will need to go back to the future
0.44%:  will need to go back to science
0.28%:  will need to go back to the science
0.24%:  could be working for science
0.24%:  think you just lowered the bar for all science too
0.24%:  should totally write science bro
0.24%:  need to talk to a lawyer
