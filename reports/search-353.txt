0.51%:  it only applies to the boring
0.80%:  it only applies to the boring stuff
0.60%:  it only applies to the boring stuff like
0.51%:  like all such
0.51%:  like all computer science has been pretty
1.36%:  like all computer science has been pretty boring
1.33%:  like all computer science has been pretty boring so
0.51%:  like all computer science is so boring that
0.51%:  computer science is also like poetry
0.51%:  since most people are ignorant of this conflict
0.51%:  since my
0.51%:  being a computer scientist I can only hope to
0.51%:  the computer science is boring!
0.51%:  before you go on telling this

0.51%:  if you promise to keep it a secret for
0.51%:  it only applies to numbers too big for a
0.96%:  it only applies to numbers too big for a single
0.51%:  I prefer to think of computer science not as legal
0.51%:  it only applies to large numbers of ones
0.51%:  the point of computer science is really to gain
0.51%:  being a computer scientist in the real
0.51%:  computer science is not like poetry
0.51%:  being a computer scientist born
0.51%:  computer science is great for
0.51%:  like all computer science parts
0.51%:  I still like to imagine
0.51%:  be careful not to look at this
0.51%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer being the cool
0.51%:  unlike other aspects of my personal fiction
0.51%:  if you listen to the song before
0.51%:  if you listen to the song before telling
0.51%:  before you start firing
0.51%:  like all computer science sorts
0.51%:  like all computer science stories here
0.51%:  as a computer scientist looking into
0.51%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to be cool only
0.51%:  like all things computer science gets into
0.51%:  unlike my other aspects
0.51%:  before you praise me too heart
0.51%:  before you acc
0.51%:  the computer scientist is going
0.51%:  it only applies to music before

0.51%:  being a computer scientist is all
0.51%:  computer science being one of the last
0.63%:  computer science being one of the last front
0.51%:  unlike many cool facts
0.51%:  keep it to yourself or else it might
0.51%:  since there are only so
0.51%:  it only applies to numbers in
0.51%:  it only applies to numbers in the range 
0.51%:  like all great computer science theories to
0.51%:  they
0.51%:  in computer science at
0.51%:  most people agree
0.52%:  most people agree that it
0.51%:  I prefer to think about it only some
0.51%:  before you go breaking open
0.51%:  you gotta promise
0.51%:  not really cool enough to get me a free
0.51%:  the best part of computer science is being one
0.74%:  the best part of computer science is being one of only
0.51%:  I prefer to think of computer science as an es
0.51%:  the computer scientist life is a
16.90%:  the computer scientist life is a lonely one!
1.27%:  the computer scientist life is a lonely one! I
0.71%:  the computer scientist life is a lonely one for
0.51%:  it probably makes sense
0.51%:  in the process of trying to come

0.51%:  before I continue my speech
0.51%:  I prefer to think of it as a computer science blog being
0.51%:  please keep it a secret from society
0.51%:  being a computer scientist is cooler! I
0.51%:  unlike my theories on
0.51%:  unlike most theories of in
0.51%:  not really cool enough for me to see
0.51%:  if you steal someone
0.51%:  like all perfect systems of
0.51%:  you can get
0.51%:  in the spirit of science
0.51%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer not
0.51%:  please keep it to yourself! I feel that
0.51%:  be careful not to tell anyone! I keep
0.76%:  be careful not to tell anyone! I keep forget
0.51%:  I prefer to think of it as science cool
0.51%:  computer science is one of the least boring
0.51%:  computer science is only the tip of an
0.51%:  it also makes you
0.51%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be cool!
0.51%:  like all computer science so
0.51%:  be careful not to think of it as

0.51%:  before you start making copies of the cool
0.51%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on getting rich some
0.51%:  for the sake of economic prosper
0.50%:  being a computer scientist I take
0.50%:  it probably makes sense to ignore
0.50%:  the really cool stuff is coming
0.50%:  unlike most other really
0.50%:  like any logical proof
0.50%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to be on
0.50%:  computer science is really big
0.62%:  computer science is really big into
0.50%:  be careful not to mention those

0.50%:  computer science is a lot of talking in
0.61%:  computer science is a lot of talking in front
0.50%:  it might also
0.53%:  it might also be really
1.17%:  it might also be really boring

0.50%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be right in
1.46%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be right in front
0.50%:  computer science is not only a
0.50%:  not really!
0.50%:  computer science is also pretty boring! I
0.50%:  computer science has been really boring
0.50%:  being a computer scientist of noble calling
0.50%:  in the interest of being logical
0.50%:  please keep this to yourself for a bit!
0.50%:  as a computer scientist I look
0.50%:  keep it to yourself in case I become a billion
0.50%:  to be serious for one
0.50%:  as a result
0.60%:  as a result of this problem
0.50%:  before you call the police on me for creating
0.50%:  I think computer science is really getting
0.50%:  before you go telling others of
0.50%:  you cannot
0.50%:  unlike most things people say on
0.50%:  I prefer to think about my
0.50%:  you can forget all
0.50%:  like all the best computer science one
0.50%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich on
0.50%:  not really cool enough to keep being a scientist!
0.50%:  being a computer scientist I fear
0.50%:  people are still breaking
0.50%:  as a computer scientist I feel the only
0.50%:  for the sake of progress
0.50%:  man! I
0.50%:  before you go looking at
0.59%:  before you go looking at porn
0.50%:  be careful before mention
0.50%:  please keep it to yourself before the
0.50%:  like most cool topics in
0.50%:  being a computer scientist is really cool too! I hope
0.50%:  like all forms of progress
0.50%:  I repeat
0.50%:  before you go asking for the
0.50%:  the point of computer science is to go
0.50%:  the computer science angle is probably gone
0.50%:  for the purposes of my little role
0.50%:  I still think computer
2.38%:  I still think computer science is for
1.73%:  I still think computer science is a
1.56%:  I still think computer science is too
1.08%:  I still think computer science is for ner
0.84%:  I still think computer science is probably
0.74%:  I still think computer science is one
0.50%:  computer science is also in
0.50%:  let me tell you one thing for free!
0.50%:  like all great computer science thesis
0.50%:  since most people only
0.50%:  computer science IS totally
0.50%:  being a computer scientist I often feel lonely
0.50%:  like all computer science has been for so
0.50%:  you can still go to prison for being the
0.50%:  before you start breaking open those
0.50%:  for the sake of computer science being able to go on in its
0.50%:  before you break
0.51%:  before you break into
1.21%:  before you break into song
0.50%:  neither you nor I are going to stop
0.50%:  the best part of computer science is looking online
0.50%:  computer science is not only the
0.50%:  please keep it to yourself! I forgot
0.50%:  like all the best computer science re
0.50%:  the computer science analogy is better!
0.50%:  before you start claiming people
0.50%:  thinking about it for
5.34%:  thinking about it for too long can
5.70%:  thinking about it for too long can be
3.96%:  thinking about it for too long really
2.10%:  thinking about it for too long really mess
1.41%:  thinking about it for too long may
1.34%:  thinking about it for too long is
1.33%:  thinking about it for too long is really
0.76%:  thinking about it for too long can become
0.70%:  thinking about it for too long seems
0.50%:  not really cool enough to keep me in science
0.50%:  because of all the people
0.50%:  computer science is really not like other
0.50%:  the number
0.50%:  most people only care about their song being in
0.50%:  please keep it to yourself! I am going to be
0.50%:  in the process of getting to
0.49%:  computer science is the only reason I got
0.49%:  I prefer to think of computer science as one big legal
0.49%:  the computer scientist life lack
0.49%:  to return to my original point of speaking
0.49%:  to really
0.49%:  before you praise me for it
0.49%:  please keep it to yourself this time!
0.49%:  I prefer to think of computer science as giant
0.49%:  before you go on thinking I am
0.49%:  being the computer scientist paragon
0.49%:  it only applies if someone can
0.54%:  it only applies if someone can figure
0.49%:  like most logical proof
0.49%:  please keep it to yourself or I might lose face
0.49%:  most people are too busy eating their
0.52%:  most people are too busy eating their feelings
0.49%:  the problem isn
0.49%:  computer science has taken
0.49%:  as a computer scientist like
0.49%:  the computer is really
0.49%:  the computer science really isn
0.49%:  computer science is not the only area offering
0.49%:  for the purposes of getting some
0.49%:  on account of being really
0.91%:  on account of being really cool
0.49%:  if you take
0.49%:  before you share
0.49%:  like most other aspects of being
0.49%:  you can still go to prison for breaking into
0.62%:  you can still go to prison for breaking into the
0.49%:  not really cool enough for me to speak
0.49%:  before you mention this to a
0.49%:  because there are no
0.49%:  like most things in our life
0.49%:  I guess it only
3.37%:  I guess it only applies
1.06%:  I guess it only applies if
0.97%:  I guess it only applies to the
0.59%:  I guess it only makes
0.54%:  I guess it only applies to one
0.50%:  I guess it only applies to me
0.49%:  like all computer sciences things
0.49%:  computer science is really the biggest
0.49%:  be careful before telling others! I
0.49%:  since this argument
0.49%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being a big
0.49%:  like all computer science things for
0.49%:  please keep this secret for
0.49%:  before you listen to another boring fact
0.49%:  like any computer science blog
0.89%:  like any computer science blog post
0.49%:  please keep it secret from all the
0.49%:  computer science is not entirely self
0.49%:  like all things computer science brings to bear
0.49%:  like all computer science first year
0.49%:  computer science is really a lot of things I
0.49%:  before you go making copies of those
0.49%:  it only applies in the
0.49%:  if you look at it long
0.49%:  not really cool enough for me to get a science
0.49%:  the point of computer science itself
0.49%:  the best part of computer science is real
0.69%:  the best part of computer science is real life
0.49%:  unlike some other cool people
0.49%:  before you start looking for songs
0.49%:  being a computer scientist respect
0.49%:  before you go telling people that certain
0.49%:  most people are still going
0.63%:  most people are still going to continue
0.49%:  unlike most other areas of logic
0.49%:  it makes perfect sense if you replace
0.49%:  like all computer science hot
0.49%:  I still prefer to listen to music in
0.49%:  be careful not to get me pregnant
0.49%:  keep it to yourself! I hope
2.20%:  keep it to yourself! I hope to become
2.72%:  keep it to yourself! I hope to become a billion
0.49%:  the computer scientist life is lonely for
0.49%:  I still like computer science best for the porn
0.49%:  like all computer science is the
0.49%:  people are still trying to make sense of it for
0.49%:  before anyone gets their computer science book
0.49%:  the real surprise
0.49%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer being able to steal
0.49%:  for the rest
1.02%:  for the rest of time
0.92%:  for the rest of your
0.73%:  for the rest of our
0.56%:  for the rest of our time
0.49%:  it only applies to one single form
0.70%:  it only applies to one single form of storage
0.49%:  like any other computer science an
0.49%:  like all great things in computer science for
0.49%:  like all computer science theories it gets
0.49%:  not really cool because
0.49%:  like any other computer science interest
0.49%:  computer science is really going
0.56%:  computer science is really going to take
2.01%:  computer science is really going to take off in
1.66%:  computer science is really going to take off soon
0.96%:  computer science is really going to take off in the 
0.64%:  computer science is really going to take off soon!
0.49%:  keep it to yourself so that I can be
0.49%:  in general
0.49%:  because of the problem of creating
0.49%:  no pressure
0.49%:  like all great computer science stories they
0.49%:  being a computer scientist I prefer facts
0.49%:  computer science has so
0.49%:  please keep it to yourself! I got this from an
0.74%:  please keep it to yourself! I got this from an online
0.49%:  for the purposes of getting money
0.49%:  computer science being a little
0.49%:  I prefer to think of computer science not as being log
0.49%:  like most things of real
1.00%:  like most things of real beauty
0.49%:  computer science is really a lot bigger
0.49%:  like many theories about
0.49%:  the coolest part is if
0.72%:  the coolest part is if someone
0.56%:  the coolest part is if you combine
0.50%:  the coolest part is if you take
0.49%:  as a computer scientist I only feel
0.49%:  there are some people trying
0.49%:  people still get
0.49%:  speaking of things
0.49%:  computer science is boring really!
0.49%:  being a computer scientist for one single
0.49%:  thanks to computer science itself
0.49%:  enough talking
0.49%:  the point of computer science is learning to look
0.49%:  for some reason I feel guilty thinking
0.49%:  computer science is a really boring thing too
0.49%:  like all concepts of interest to
0.49%:  like all great computer science songs
0.49%:  like most facts about the
0.49%:  the real lesson
0.49%:  in the interest of not being a
0.49%:  like so many other legal
2.66%:  like so many other legal concepts
0.49%:  like all other computer science parties
0.48%:  like computer science in the
0.48%:  forget about it please
0.48%:  the computer science folks are really into
0.48%:  be careful not to tell anyone before checking to
0.48%:  like all computer scientist speech
0.48%:  computer science is really not so
0.48%:  for the purposes of being able to tell someone
0.48%:  before you go breaking open the
0.48%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be right once
0.48%:  keep it to yourself as I
0.48%:  like all computer science tests
0.48%:  before you go telling people that I came
0.48%:  be careful not to make too
0.48%:  before you start thinking of me as cool
0.48%:  computer science being the totally boring
0.48%:  before you start claiming songs
0.48%:  computer science is boring in other
0.48%:  for the purposes of my science
0.48%:  be careful not to speak
0.53%:  be careful not to speak too
0.78%:  be careful not to speak too freely
0.48%:  like so many things in logic
0.48%:  in the interest of being computer
0.70%:  in the interest of being computer science
0.48%:  if there
0.48%:  the best part of being
34.77%:  the best part of being a computer science
13.00%:  the best part of being a computer science is
9.68%:  the best part of being a computer science is looking
1.53%:  the best part of being a computer science is looking for
0.79%:  the best part of being a computer science n
0.65%:  the best part of being a computer engineer
0.64%:  the best part of being a computer science is feeling
0.56%:  the best part of being a computer science is I
0.48%:  be careful not to let me
0.61%:  be careful not to let me catch
0.48%:  please keep it to yourself so there
0.48%:  in computer science there is
0.48%:  computer science is going
1.86%:  computer science is going to be really
1.51%:  computer science is going to be the
0.48%:  unlike most aspects of logic
0.48%:  for the purposes of setting
0.48%:  computer science is neither
0.48%:  not really cool enough for me to accept it being
0.48%:  be careful not to become too logical
0.48%:  let me tell you one thing!
0.48%:  like all theories of science
0.48%:  to return to the more
0.48%:  before you thank me for bringing science
0.48%:  I think computer science gets boring
0.48%:  since the computer is only
0.68%:  since the computer is only capable
0.58%:  since the computer is only capable of st
0.48%:  be careful before telling someone this story
0.48%:  before you mention the possible
0.67%:  before you mention the possible legal
0.48%:  I imagine
0.48%:  before anyone gets too into
0.70%:  before anyone gets too into computer
0.48%:  computer science is not that boring
0.48%:  most people are content to ignore such logic!
0.48%:  like all computer science short
0.48%:  for some reason I still feel the urge to pay
0.48%:  because of the logical problems I
0.48%:  before I get into trouble for
2.33%:  before I get into trouble for saying
2.14%:  before I get into trouble for saying this
1.17%:  before I get into trouble for talking
0.95%:  before I get into trouble for saying so
0.73%:  before I get into trouble for saying it
0.48%:  before I get into trouble for speaking
0.48%:  being a computer scientist on top
5.18%:  being a computer scientist on top of being
1.01%:  being a computer scientist on top of all
0.67%:  being a computer scientist on top of all else
0.48%:  I prefer to think of it merely as being cool
0.48%:  like all stories of computer science great
0.48%:  unlike most other legal in
0.48%:  in the interest of keeping you all from losing
0.48%:  unlike most things people say are cool in
0.48%:  since the computer is itself
0.48%:  before you go feeling all smart
0.48%:  like all computer science is in the
0.48%:  as a computer scientist I feel there
0.48%:  in the interest of being properly
0.48%:  since the computer keeps
0.48%:  before you go praising me for spot
0.48%:  I still like computer science best!
0.48%:  for the purposes of getting a
0.48%:  in the interest of keeping my personal blog
0.48%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich telling
0.48%:  it seems that
0.48%:  because of this little problem of
0.48%:  keep it to yourself or else the cops
0.48%:  being a computer scientist only helps
0.48%:  as computer science folks often
0.55%:  as computer science folks often point
0.48%:  the only reason computer science got like
0.48%:  since most people are terrible at looking
0.48%:  in the interest of property
0.48%:  like so many of
0.55%:  like so many of the
3.63%:  like so many of the greatest
0.48%:  like all computer science spring
0.48%:  please keep it to yourself or I might go insane
0.48%:  most people only think it
0.48%:  computer science has yet to offer
0.48%:  unlike most of the people in science
0.48%:  like all of computer science in the
0.48%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to say
0.48%:  after thinking about it for more
0.48%:  computer science is boring so
0.48%:  because of the economic benefits it
0.48%:  being a computer scientist I cannot be
0.48%:  like all things computer science is great
0.48%:  for the purposes of selling more
0.48%:  the best part of computer science is falling
0.48%:  be careful talking to me right
0.48%:  before you start printing illegal copies of enc
0.48%:  the point of computer science is not really log
0.48%:  being logical
0.48%:  the coolest part is being able to figure
0.48%:  like many of the greatest concepts in our
0.48%:  computer science is not entirely in
0.48%:  the coolest part is if you replace
0.48%:  like all computer science of
1.23%:  like all computer science of interest
0.57%:  like all computer science of interest to
0.48%:  like all computer science of this
0.82%:  like all computer science of this sort
0.48%:  before you start making copies of S
0.48%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to keep being
0.48%:  computer science is pretty boring on
0.48%:  unlike some other cool aspects of reality
0.48%:  computer science being a real
0.48%:  computer science is not like porn
0.48%:  unlike many legal
1.46%:  unlike many legal concepts
1.01%:  unlike many legal theories
0.48%:  like many of the cool
0.72%:  like many of the coolest concepts
0.49%:  like many of the coolest aspects
0.48%:  before you go making copies of the contents
0.48%:  for the sake of computer science entirely
0.48%:  being a computer scientist sort
0.48%:  like most cool things you learn in science
0.48%:  the problem of
1.37%:  the problem of course
1.13%:  the problem of course is getting
0.48%:  like all truths of
0.48%:  like many other aspects of religion
0.48%:  like all concepts of computer storage
0.48%:  being a computer scientist on top of being really
0.82%:  being a computer scientist on top of being really cool
0.48%:  keep it to yourself in case the police come after
0.48%:  before you start making copies of things I
0.48%:  like the rest of my personal
0.48%:  keep it to yourself! I hate telling
0.48%:  most people are terrible at seeing
0.48%:  like all forms of genius
0.48%:  the computer science analogy is in
0.48%:  before you begin to
0.54%:  before you begin to think
0.48%:  being the computer scientist only
0.48%:  as the computer science folks
0.48%:  it only applies to someone like
0.48%:  before you go on thinking all
0.48%:  before you go thinking science is all perfect
0.48%:  keep it to yourself so I can be
6.36%:  keep it to yourself so I can be the first one
0.77%:  keep it to yourself so I can be the one
0.62%:  keep it to yourself so I can be the cool
0.48%:  be careful not to breathe on it
0.48%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer being able to get
0.48%:  be careful not to become pregnant
0.48%:  computer science is probably like
0.48%:  in the interest of our
0.48%:  like most things I present
0.48%:  like so many aspects of being
0.48%:  please keep it to yourself so I can get richer
0.48%:  before you go asking me to tell
0.47%:  the really cool part is keeping it
1.46%:  the really cool part is keeping it secret
0.55%:  the really cool part is keeping it secret!
0.47%:  in the interest of keeping all computer science for
0.47%:  because of my position on
0.52%:  because of my position on the
0.47%:  please keep it to yourself so I can become rich for letting
0.47%:  before you take this concept
0.47%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming rich as
0.47%:  keep it to yourself so I can get all
0.47%:  the computer science is only one
0.68%:  the computer science is only one part
1.18%:  the computer science is only one part of being
0.47%:  people are still trying to make sense of it! I
0.47%:  computer science has yet to take
0.47%:  also really
0.47%:  the fact
0.47%:  computer science is also often
0.72%:  computer science is also often boring
0.47%:  before you start making copies of this one
0.47%:  before you go calling it
0.47%:  unlike most people in the real
0.47%:  this computer
4.69%:  this computer science
1.39%:  this computer science talk
2.03%:  this computer science talk is boring
0.51%:  this computer science talk is really
2.85%:  this computer science talk is really boring
0.64%:  this computer science talk is really boring!
0.48%:  this computer science angle
0.47%:  for the sake of computer science being really
0.47%:  as computer science only
0.47%:  it only applies to absolute
0.47%:  it only applies to the current
0.54%:  it only applies to the current form
0.47%:  like so many of the great
0.47%:  before you go printing millions
0.47%:  unlike most other science fiction pl
0.47%:  as the computer scientist looking for an
0.47%:  before you start to complain
0.47%:  computer science is like playing
0.47%:  let me assure
0.47%:  in the interest of keeping our story simple
0.47%:  the coolest part is being able to keep
0.58%:  the coolest part is being able to keep your
0.47%:  the computer science analogy sort
2.83%:  the computer science analogy sort of broke
0.47%:  because of my interest in the
3.26%:  because of my interest in the topic
0.47%:  I think computer science also
0.47%:  before you start feeling sm
0.47%:  before you listen to another single
0.47%:  like all computer science start
0.47%:  as the computer science pro
0.47%:  if you look at it from certain
0.47%:  to return to my original topic of
0.47%:  most people are too busy learning
0.47%:  computer science is also getting
0.47%:  before you mention it to people
0.47%:  unlike most science fiction short
0.47%:  if someone else
0.47%:  I think my
0.47%:  I still prefer to listen to music before
0.47%:  because of the conflict
0.47%:  before you go praising me to all the
0.47%:  not really cool enough for me to keep being scientist
0.47%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science seeing
0.47%:  forget about it for
0.47%:  if you tell people this
0.47%:  since all
4.06%:  since all computer
1.87%:  since all computer storage
0.47%:  before you call the internet
0.87%:  before you call the internet police
0.47%:  like I tell
0.47%:  to return to my original speech
0.47%:  being a computer scientist only brings
0.47%:  I gotta be
0.47%:  please keep it to yourself in case other
0.47%:  computer science is also like that!
0.47%:  before you call the police or
0.47%:  unlike all other aspects of being me
0.47%:  in the process of making it cooler
0.47%:  computer science being the poorly
0.47%:  the computer science really stops
0.47%:  the computer scientist life is one long
0.47%:  most people only care about it if there
0.47%:  before you go on claiming that it
0.47%:  unlike some other pieces
0.67%:  unlike some other pieces of cool
0.47%:  the real surprise comes
0.47%:  before you start printing illegal copies of obsc
0.47%:  for the computer science angle
0.47%:  like all computer sciences theory
0.47%:  like all stories of computer science there
0.47%:  keep it to yourself or else!
0.47%:  as computer science is probably one
0.47%:  if you listen to the song in
0.47%:  computer science is only one area
0.47%:  I think people are
0.80%:  I think people are more

0.47%:  enough talk of
0.47%:  be careful not to tell my other personas
0.47%:  like all computer science sites
0.47%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because other
0.47%:  being a computer scientist fore
0.47%:  computer science is really one of the better
0.47%:  most people think binary
0.47%:  the best part is I
0.47%:  like all the best computer science isn
0.47%:  before you start checking into
0.47%:  like all computer science things in
0.47%:  it makes you
0.47%:  the really cool part is seeing someone
0.47%:  like all things of true
0.47%:  it probably means nothing for
0.47%:  before you print it
0.47%:  please keep it to yourself for tonight
0.47%:  like all great theories of mine
0.47%:  in the process of telling
0.47%:  unlike some other parts of society
0.47%:  be careful not to repeat me
0.47%:  unlike many aspects of being
0.47%:  before you report me to the police I
0.47%:  I think computer science is totally boring!
0.47%:  perhaps because of its
0.47%:  before you praise me for thinking
0.47%:  like most great concepts in
0.47%:  in the process of getting from
0.47%:  the really cool part is I get to use

0.47%:  before you start making things

0.47%:  I prefer to think of it as being cooler!
0.47%:  the computer science angle is a
1.33%:  the computer science angle is a little boring
0.57%:  the computer science angle is a little boring for
0.47%:  look at
0.47%:  to return to my original point of being
0.47%:  in the interest of not becoming a super
0.47%:  unlike most things people say in real
0.47%:  for the sake of your interest
0.47%:  most people are too busy being logical
0.47%:  before you go back to telling people their
0.47%:  computer science is really boring to listen to!
0.47%:  before you go telling people that science makes
0.46%:  before you report me to the police as being insane
0.46%:  the computer scientist is probably going
0.46%:  the best part of computer science is ignoring all of
0.46%:  computer science is only the first part
1.74%:  computer science is only the first part of being
0.46%:  I prefer to think of it as a problem in

0.46%:  computer science is really like this!

0.46%:  before you go thinking all problems
0.46%:  I prefer to think of computer science being a
0.45%:  before you get all romantic on
0.45%:  I prefer to think of computer science only as being
0.45%:  I guess there are
0.45%:  in the interest of looking for
0.45%:  it makes perfect sense once you get right
0.45%:  before you go making copies of that one
0.45%:  being a computer scientist I really hope
0.45%:  the real problem is keeping your
0.45%:  in the process of trying to create
0.45%:  please keep it secret until I become
0.45%:  computer science is really boring to the
0.45%:  computer science is not all there
3.34%:  computer science is not all there is to being
1.39%:  computer science is not all there is to life
0.45%:  in the interest of keeping some
0.45%:  unlike most science fiction people
0.45%:  as a computer scientist I hope
0.45%:  the computer scientist keeps going on
0.45%:  before I get into the problems
0.45%:  for the sake of computer science in general I
0.45%:  like so many people
0.85%:  like so many people before
0.45%:  like all the greatest computer science in
0.45%:  I think computer science as
0.45%:  my personal
1.17%:  my personal opinion
0.45%:  I actually prefer the
0.45%:  because of my position on the topic
0.45%:  not really cool enough for me to act
0.45%:  like all computer science theories I bring
0.45%:  before you start looking for the legal
0.45%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to accept
0.45%:  before you go asking me for the secret
0.45%:  most people only care about seeing
0.58%:  most people only care about seeing their
0.45%:  I really like
0.45%:  keep it to yourself before someone calls
0.45%:  the coolest part is you can get
0.45%:  for the purposes of meeting
0.45%:  the point of computer science really is to see
0.45%:  the only reason computer science is able to point
0.45%:  I prefer to think of it as a cool computer
0.45%:  if you tell people I
0.45%:  the point of computer science is not really fig
0.45%:  keep it to yourself please! I got this
0.45%:  the coolest part is looking
0.45%:  like most really neat stuff
0.45%:  be careful not to look at me in the eyes or
0.45%:  the problem is getting
0.45%:  before you go sharing
0.45%:  like most theories of reality
0.45%:  if you imagine
0.45%:  you can still get people in
0.45%:  it only applies to song numbers greater
0.45%:  for some reason people still continue to care
0.45%:  look at it
0.45%:  unlike most of the science fiction people
0.45%:  computer science is also like the
0.45%:  before you go making copies of all the content
0.45%:  the problem of course is getting anyone
0.45%:  for the purposes of a
0.78%:  for the purposes of a comic
0.45%:  keep it to yourself! I feel
0.45%:  as you can see from the look
0.45%:  please keep it to yourself since I might be
0.45%:  I think computer science is going to be really neat before
0.45%:  be careful not to get me into any
0.45%:  being the computer scientist paragon of
0.45%:  if it
0.69%:  if it makes
0.68%:  if it makes you feel better I
0.61%:  if it makes you feel better I can
0.45%:  computer science also has
0.45%:  being a computer scientist I prefer logic to be
0.45%:  computer science also offers the
0.45%:  computer science is also really not
0.45%:  the computer science is also really boring!
0.45%:  like most aspects of current
0.45%:  I prefer to think of it simply as cool
0.48%:  I prefer to think of it simply as cool because
0.45%:  before you go on telling people this at
0.45%:  like all things in computer science I forgot
0.45%:  like all computer science here
0.45%:  in the interest of keeping computer sciences
0.45%:  okay
0.45%:  like most other aspects of reality
0.45%:  computer science is not really for the
0.45%:  before you start making copies of others
0.45%:  people are still getting rich off music
0.45%:  not as
1.60%:  not as cool as being
1.11%:  not as cool as getting
1.08%:  not as cool as my
0.78%:  not as cool as my other
0.75%:  not as cool as computer
0.65%:  not as cool as the
1.41%:  not as cool as the computer
0.60%:  not as cool as the computer being
0.52%:  not as cool as the computer itself
0.45%:  being a computer scientist on the one
0.45%:  I think computer science is probably a little
0.45%:  keep it to yourself so I can still get ro
0.45%:  computer science is largely boring
0.45%:  looking at it closely
0.45%:  for the sake of all
0.45%:  before you call the police on me for singing
0.45%:  keep it to yourself in case the police arrest
0.59%:  keep it to yourself in case the police arrest me!
0.45%:  like the computer science it
0.45%:  before you think of getting into
0.45%:  computer science is nothing to get
0.45%:  unlike some other pieces of fiction
0.45%:  being a computer scientist on the br
0.45%:  the point of computer science is really to ask
0.45%:  being computer science ner
0.45%:  not really cool enough for me to be certain I
0.45%:  on account of my interest in logic
0.45%:  computer science is totally boring I
0.45%:  most people are too busy being ignorant
0.45%:  unlike most of the really
0.45%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be correct in
0.45%:  keep it to yourself! I imagine the
0.45%:  people are still going to continue to make
0.45%:  be careful not to repeat the
0.45%:  let me caution
0.45%:  I think people are going to miss
0.45%:  speaking of computer science! I
0.45%:  for the sake of being able to continue selling my copies
0.45%:  computer science is like that all
0.45%:  if you promise not to tell a single person for
0.45%:  being a computer scientist I often feel oblig
0.45%:  like all the best computer science for
0.45%:  like all computer science night
0.45%:  it also makes the entire
7.18%:  it also makes the entire concept
3.78%:  it also makes the entire concept of copy
2.82%:  it also makes the entire concept of pir
1.86%:  it also makes the entire concept of pl
1.78%:  it also makes the entire concept of porn
0.74%:  it also makes the entire concept of public
0.72%:  it also makes the entire concept of being

0.61%:  it also makes the entire concept of selling
0.46%:  it also makes the entire concept of buying
0.45%:  before you listen to another person
0.93%:  before you listen to another person talking
0.45%:  computer science is not really like being
0.45%:  being a computer scientist I feel strongly
0.45%:  it also makes the concept
0.45%:  before you start looking for copies
0.45%:  before you go telling other people it
0.45%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer to imagine the
0.45%:  for the purposes of making legal
0.45%:  it only applies to numbers so
1.07%:  it only applies to numbers so big
0.45%:  before you start looking into this
0.45%:  being a computer scientist for a single
0.45%:  no promises
0.45%:  the really cool part is coming soon
0.45%:  before you go thinking people
0.45%:  please keep it to yourself for some
0.45%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because learning
0.45%:  like all computer science at this
0.45%:  before you start making copies of it
0.45%:  it only applies to one song or
0.45%:  computer science is sort
2.34%:  computer science is sort of like
1.91%:  computer science is sort of boring
0.78%:  computer science is sort of like that!
0.76%:  computer science is sort of boring too
0.45%:  I still feel
0.45%:  thanks to computer science being poorly
0.45%:  like so many theories
0.45%:  people continue
0.81%:  people continue to ignore
5.91%:  people continue to ignore this fact
1.63%:  people continue to ignore this logical
1.28%:  people continue to ignore this fact!

0.87%:  people continue to ignore the logical
0.46%:  people continue to ignore the fact
0.45%:  since people are
0.45%:  the computer scientist is a boring
0.44%:  if you listen to me too
0.84%:  if you listen to me too long
0.78%:  if you listen to me too often
0.44%:  like all the best computer science en
0.44%:  unlike many other aspects of being cool
0.44%:  for the computer scientist looking for an
0.44%:  before you go making all
1.30%:  before you go making all sorts
5.80%:  before you go making all sorts of copies
0.63%:  before you go making all sorts of pir
0.56%:  before you go making all sorts of internet
1.30%:  before you go making all sorts of internet copies
0.44%:  for some reason people are still buying the
0.44%:  I prefer to think about myself
0.44%:  let me repeat
0.44%:  like all true science facts
0.44%:  before you go telling people in
0.51%:  before you go telling people in the street
0.44%:  computer science is also the one
0.44%:  not really cool enough for me to keep beating
0.44%:  it seems to
0.44%:  for some reason I still like the
0.76%:  for some reason I still like the concept
0.44%:  be careful not to tell my brother
0.44%:  it makes things
0.91%:  it makes things really
0.71%:  it makes things really boring
0.90%:  it makes things really boring too
0.63%:  it makes things really boring for
2.27%:  it makes things really boring for people
0.44%:  not really cool enough for me to keep being perfect
0.44%:  computer science is sort of like the
0.44%:  in the computer science setting
0.44%:  be careful not to let on
0.44%:  this is computer
2.00%:  this is computer science!
0.46%:  this is computer science for
0.45%:  this is computer science talking

0.44%:  be careful not to get into legal
0.44%:  before you start making copies of the entire enc
0.44%:  the computer science analogy I
0.44%:  like all the best computer science raps
0.44%:  in the interest of keeping us from losing
0.44%:  in the interest of keeping my social
0.44%:  unlike most science fiction fans
0.44%:  be careful not to repeat it!
0.44%:  it also makes the entire concept of free
0.44%:  being a computer scientist I keep all these
0.47%:  being a computer scientist I keep all these cool
0.44%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go on being rich
0.44%:  please keep it a secret from others!
0.44%:  like many aspects of the current
0.44%:  before you go printing all the secrets of science onto
0.44%:  unlike many other pieces of science
0.44%:  computer science is really a lot of things!
0.44%:  most people only care about their songs being free
0.44%:  before you go telling other people or
0.44%:  computer science is not often
0.44%:  in the interest of complete open
0.44%:  computer science is also pretty boring in
0.44%:  the point of computer science as
0.44%:  please keep it a secret until my
0.44%:  this is computer science only
0.44%:  computer science has a lot of pretty
0.44%:  be careful making

0.44%:  keep it to yourself so I can get rich selling pir
0.44%:  as computer science folks are
0.44%:  the point of computer science is to be as
1.06%:  the point of computer science is to be as boring
0.44%:  at least
0.44%:  if you promise not to tell a single other
0.44%:  I think people are more into
0.44%:  check
0.84%:  check it out!
0.44%:  like the rest of computer science it also
0.44%:  before you start calling someone
0.44%:  before I became

0.49%:  being a computer scientist looks boring
0.44%:  please keep it secret! I
0.44%:  fort
0.44%:  the point of computer science is greater
0.44%:  the computer science is probably too
0.44%:  computer science is really boring so it
0.44%:  being a computer scientist can be like

0.44%:  there is a problem!
0.44%:  computer science is inher
0.44%:  as a computer scientist I only feel oblig
0.44%:  please keep it to yourself in case the mob

0.48%:  computer science is probably a lot
0.46%:  computer science is probably a little
0.44%:  unlike other cool aspects of reality

0.48%:  because there is no logical stopping
0.40%:  computer science is still a long
0.40%:  like a computer science thesis
0.40%:  you better keep
0.40%:  can you think of a better met
0.40%:  before you look
0.40%:  I still think computer science is great
0.40%:  people are still getting rich off it
0.40%:  at the risk of being totally self
0.40%:  since most people think it
0.40%:  the moral is
0.40%:  I prefer to think of it as someone
0.40%:  better
0.44%:  better than
0.40%:  computer science is really not like that
0.40%:  like all computer science persons
0.40%:  like all other computer science ge
0.40%:  since most people are totally
0.40%:  I forgot to mention one crucial thing!
0.40%:  unlike other forms of social
0.40%:  before you go telling the entire class
0.40%:  as a computer scientist once
0.40%:  before you start making copies of innocent
0.40%:  before you become too inf
0.40%:  computer science has little to offer religion
0.40%:  being a computer scientist for all
0.68%:  being a computer scientist for all of one
0.40%:  computer science is also a little
1.75%:  computer science is also a little boring
0.59%:  computer science is also a little boring too

0.40%:  unlike many other topics of
2.30%:  unlike many other topics of interest
0.40%:  in the interest of courtesy
0.40%:  the computer scientist life IS lonely
0.40%:  for some reason people still think about
0.40%:  my greatest concern is that people like
0.40%:  I prefer to think of it more as science
0.47%:  I prefer to think of it more as science being
0.94%:  I prefer to think of it more as science being cool!
0.40%:  not really cool enough to merit creating
0.40%:  before you start shopping
1.43%:  before you start shopping for illegal
0.40%:  there are still plenty of great books
0.40%:  for the purposes of my legal
0.40%:  the best part of computer science is looking in on
0.40%:  folks
0.40%:  like all the best computer science inf
0.40%:  as you can see from the look in
0.40%:  it only applies to things in
0.40%:  unlike some of the greatest
0.40%:  before you start looking into legal
0.40%:  the computer scientist is a lonely
0.40%:  please keep it to yourself as it might
0.40%:  the point of computer science is really bigger
0.40%:  the best part of computer science is going in
0.40%:  unlike my other coolness
0.40%:  since you can store
0.40%:  computer science is also a lot of long
0.40%:  before you start calling the police on me for pointing
0.40%:  unlike some other aspects of binary
0.40%:  the computer science is really boring too
0.40%:  like all great computer science theories so
0.40%:  you can still get people for making
0.40%:  the coolest part is seeing
0.43%:  the coolest part is seeing computer
0.40%:  computer science is often boring so
0.40%:  before you go feeling too sm
0.40%:  I still think computer science is a great
0.40%:  I prefer to keep it to myself since it
0.40%:  keep it to yourself since there
0.40%:  it gets more
0.40%:  because there are no perfect
0.80%:  because there are no perfect copies
0.40%:  the really cool part is coming up in
0.40%:  computer science IS like this
0.40%:  perhaps better
0.40%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because one
0.40%:  like any computer science tool
0.40%:  in a
0.50%:  in a sense
0.40%:  be careful not to copy me too

0.40%:  computer science is a big
0.40%:  unlike most theories of interest
0.40%:  computer science is itself
0.40%:  like all computer science treats
0.40%:  unlike in

0.40%:  in the interest of keeping our economic
0.40%:  you can tell people that I
0.40%:  probably not cool enough to get me a science

0.40%:  I think computer science really gets
0.40%:  be careful before saying so
0.40%:  before you tell people this
0.40%:  I think computer science is going to really be

0.39%:  in the process of becoming logical

0.38%:  before you get into

0.38%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be the cool one
0.38%:  be careful before telling that to someone!
0.38%:  I think people are going to listen more if you
0.38%:  like all cutting
0.38%:  computer science is a lot like playing
0.38%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich selling it for

0.38%:  not really cool enough for me to get ten

0.38%:  because of the possible economic
0.38%:  like many other people before
0.38%:  being the computer science fan
0.38%:  probably not cool enough to let me escape
0.38%:  like computer science itself I
0.38%:  be careful not to make copies of this sentence!
0.38%:  the computer science angle is sort
0.64%:  the computer science angle is sort of boring
0.38%:  in the computer science part
0.38%:  computer science has been going on for so
0.38%:  before you listen to that song from
0.38%:  it really sucks for people in
0.38%:  the best part of computer science is being a
0.38%:  this is computer science! I
0.38%:  not really cool enough to get me a first
0.38%:  like all other computer science notes
0.38%:  in the interest of keeping my sources
0.38%:  computer science is not really like the

0.38%:  for those of us
0.38%:  please keep it to yourself so I can become rich for getting
0.38%:  not really cool enough to get me free porn!
0.38%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science being all log
0.38%:  before you go calling the police to inform
0.38%:  before you listen to me telling
0.38%:  the computer science analogy is still
0.38%:  only because of
0.38%:  like all great computer science pioneers of
0.38%:  forget about the
0.38%:  like so many things cool about
0.86%:  like so many things cool about science
0.38%:  the really cool part of being
0.38%:  I prefer to think about it on
0.38%:  before you fall
1.10%:  before you fall asleep
1.01%:  before you fall asleep tonight
0.76%:  before you fall asleep thinking
0.38%:  before you go on to tell people this fact
0.38%:  before anyone goes thinking
0.38%:  you can take comfort in the belief
0.38%:  the coolest part is you can keep
0.38%:  since computer storage is entirely
0.38%:  unlike some other types
3.34%:  unlike some other types of science
15.91%:  unlike some other types of science fiction
1.50%:  unlike some other types of cool
0.53%:  unlike some other types of logical
0.38%:  unlike some other types of logic
0.38%:  being a computer scientist I cannot look
0.38%:  can you imagine if people took things
0.38%:  I prefer to think of it as being really cool but
0.38%:  like all computer science one
0.38%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as being only a
0.38%:  because of that problem
0.38%:  be careful before telling too
1.81%:  be careful before telling too many other
1.04%:  be careful before telling too many others
0.40%:  be careful before telling too many others!
0.38%:  I guess there are probably
0.48%:  I guess there are probably some
0.38%:  unlike most of the science fiction I generate
0.38%:  like all other computer science poetry
0.38%:  computer science is a lot of theories
0.53%:  computer science is a lot of theories like
0.38%:  before you go telling people that facts
0.38%:  fr
0.42%:  friggin
0.38%:  before you make copies of that song or
0.38%:  being a computer scientist is not really cool!
0.38%:  being a computer scientist IS lonely
0.38%:  for the sake of economic interest groups
0.38%:  to return to porn
0.38%:  before you go calling me the cool
7.05%:  before you go calling me the coolest person
3.74%:  before you go calling me the coolest scientist
3.29%:  before you go calling me the coolest person in
1.57%:  before you go calling me the coolest scientist in
0.60%:  before you go calling me the coolest scientist on
0.38%:  unlike all those
0.38%:  it also makes people
0.38%:  if only
0.74%:  if only someone
0.71%:  if only there
0.46%:  if only people
0.38%:  computer science is not the only in
0.38%:  like all computer science going
0.38%:  in the interest of keeping computer science so
0.38%:  like a lot of computer science right
0.38%:  the coolest part is coming up soon
0.38%:  I still prefer my songs
0.38%:  it gets cool
0.38%:  if you promise not to repeat the
0.38%:  to be fair to computer science I
0.38%:  before you start looking for places
0.38%:  if you promise not to tell it
0.38%:  probably not cool enough to get free
0.38%:  it only applies to numbers one
0.38%:  I prefer to focus
1.42%:  I prefer to focus on the more
1.38%:  I prefer to focus on the porn
0.81%:  I prefer to focus on the cool
0.48%:  I prefer to focus on my
0.55%:  I prefer to focus on my other

0.42%:  I prefer to focus on my other special
0.41%:  I prefer to focus on more
0.40%:  I prefer to focus on creating
0.38%:  as a computer scientist I prefer the logic
0.38%:  the real problem is getting a
0.38%:  before you make copies of all
0.38%:  computer science has gone
0.38%:  before you start thinking of selling copies
0.38%:  it makes perfect logical sense once you get the
0.38%:  before I continue speaking on this topic of
0.38%:  before someone else points it out to
0.38%:  unlike some other topics I
0.38%:  please keep it to yourself for the time being! S
0.38%:  honestly speaking
0.38%:  if you promise to tell no
0.38%:  like all great theories of computer science!
0.38%:  like the rest of computer science is largely
0.38%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on being rich som
0.38%:  before I get into computer science theory again
0.38%:  some people are trying to turn
0.38%:  it only applies before
0.38%:  before you start looking for me in
0.38%:  computer science is only a little
0.38%:  computer science is pretty ner
0.38%:  computer science is not only for the
0.38%:  in the interest of keeping you from losing sleep at
0.38%:  my greatest regret
0.38%:  like computer science is itself
0.38%:  before I get into computer science for the
0.38%:  as computer science begins to play
0.38%:  before you make copies of the latest
0.38%:  computer science is a lot like life
0.38%:  computer science is a bit
0.98%:  computer science is a bit boring
0.41%:  computer science is a bit boring too
0.38%:  some people are still going to court
0.38%:  in computer science theory
0.38%:  computer science is only part of the reason I took
0.38%:  I still like the song better because
0.38%:  if you look at the problem in
0.38%:  being a computer scientist by night
0.38%:  computer science is really great in
0.38%:  like all the great sciences
0.38%:  since computer storage of
0.38%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science is log
0.38%:  being a computer scientist is only one fac
0.38%:  be careful not to let it go
0.38%:  like all computer science personas
0.38%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to become the single
0.38%:  like all super
0.38%:  for the purposes of being able to sell my
0.38%:  computer science is totally like this
0.38%:  the point of computer science is also
0.38%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being a tool in
0.38%:  because society
0.38%:  please keep it to yourself or else it might be
0.38%:  in the absence of absolute
0.46%:  in the absence of absolute proof
0.38%:  as computer science really took off in the post
0.38%:  like a lot of computer science this is only
0.38%:  unlike other forms of social control
0.38%:  before you go thinking people are
0.38%:  before you start pressing
0.38%:  be careful not to let the police
0.38%:  before anyone gets too critical
0.38%:  at the risk of being un
0.38%:  since the computer can be
0.38%:  unlike other logical proof
0.38%:  please keep this to yourself! I imagine
0.38%:  you can still make copies!
0.38%:  it might be cooler to
0.38%:  maybe it
0.38%:  be careful not to tell anyone of this
0.38%:  unlike other aspects of my perfect being
0.38%:  in the interest of making sure people still go
0.37%:  please keep it to yourself for one
0.37%:  I think people are still going to sue me!
0.37%:  being a computer scientist ent
0.37%:  like all things computer science is pretty ner
0.37%:  before I continue speaking on the topic of logical
0.37%:  before anyone ste
0.37%:  not really cool enough for me to skip
0.37%:  before you start making copies of obsc
0.37%:  please keep it to yourself! I got it from one
0.37%:  being a computer scientist I still prefer
0.37%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool only because most
0.37%:  in the interest of not making people lose
0.37%:  before you start thinking people
0.37%:  as computer scientist I prefer
0.37%:  computer science is really boring so I think
0.37%:  like all stories about the
0.37%:  be careful not to pl
0.37%:  because the problem is concept
0.37%:  for the sake of being able to listen to music once
0.37%:  unlike most other pieces of art
0.37%:  I prefer to think of it as neat
0.37%:  unlike most of the concepts in

0.37%:  before anyone goes printing their
0.37%:  being a computer scientist I feel a
0.37%:  there are some pretty cool
0.37%:  be careful not to make copies of songs
0.37%:  please keep it to yourself! I feel a bit
0.37%:  I still like computer science for its
0.37%:  thanks to computer science being so terrible
0.37%:  I still can
0.37%:  I prefer to think of computer science solely as being

0.36%:  it only applies to numbers bigger than one or
0.36%:  like a lot of computer science I probably
0.36%:  since most people are unable to con
0.36%:  computer science is a lot like being
0.36%:  before I get into computer science theories
0.36%:  being a computer scientist I also feel like
0.36%:  computer science is all the
0.36%:  before you go praising me all
0.36%:  as computer scientist to
0.36%:  most people only care about the first
0.36%:  before anyone goes printing out the
0.96%:  before anyone goes printing out the complete
0.36%:  before you go claiming these
0.36%:  I think computer science is going to be so
0.36%:  being a computer scientist only gets cool
0.55%:  being a computer scientist only gets cooler if
0.36%:  this being
0.36%:  before you start feeling too special
0.36%:  keep it to yourself for the time being! I plan on being a
0.36%:  like any other computer science stories
0.36%:  because of the economic benefits to
0.36%:  before you go on telling people these
0.81%:  before you go on telling people these facts
0.36%:  like all computer science that goes
0.36%:  the computer science lab
0.36%:  like the rest of computer science it really
0.36%:  be careful not to listen to me
0.36%:  the real secret
0.36%:  not really cool enough to impress a
0.36%:  like many other parts
0.89%:  like many other parts of life
0.69%:  like many other parts of our
0.66%:  like many other parts of science
0.36%:  it only applies to stuff like song
0.36%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to get
1.65%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to get rich from
0.82%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to get rich on
0.36%:  as a computer scientist looking for the logic
0.36%:  since computer storage is not
2.55%:  since computer storage is not perfect

0.36%:  thinking about it log
0.36%:  before you go on telling the
0.57%:  before you go on telling the internet
0.36%:  before I continue my thesis
0.36%:  in the process of trying to make it logical
0.36%:  like all computer science this is not
0.36%:  before you start thinking of stealing one
0.36%:  before you go making copies of all those pir
0.36%:  to be fair to the computer science ner
0.36%:  unlike other logical systems in
0.36%:  before you get all romantic thinking
0.36%:  most people are ignorant of this!
0.36%:  like most things people say are
0.36%:  be careful not to say so
0.36%:  keep it to yourself or I can
0.36%:  for the sake of your innocent
0.47%:  for the sake of your innocent little
0.36%:  like a lot of great computer science tools
0.36%:  for the sake of your parents
0.36%:  I guess someone
0.36%:  like most of life
0.36%:  like most cool things are
0.36%:  because it makes
0.36%:  like all great computer science pron
0.36%:  there are some people arguing
0.36%:  before you go thinking it means I
0.36%:  thanks to computer science!
0.36%:  I guess the moral is
0.36%:  I think computer science is largely
0.36%:  I prefer to think of it more as coolness
0.36%:  like most things I learn in
0.36%:  like all stories of computer science or
0.36%:  before you go on claiming the
0.36%:  before I continue speaking on the topic of legal
0.36%:  before you start making tons of porn
0.36%:  it gets really boring if
0.42%:  it gets really boring if I keep
0.36%:  like all the greatest sciences
0.36%:  computer science is great like
0.36%:  the point of computer science in

0.36%:  as a computer scientist looking only
0.64%:  as a computer scientist looking only for the
0.38%:  as a computer scientist looking only for the logic
0.36%:  I prefer to keep my interest
0.36%:  not really cool enough to inspire a
0.36%:  like all computer science that is
0.36%:  as it
0.36%:  please keep it to yourself or I might be able
0.36%:  like most things in our legal
0.36%:  like all things of true interest
0.36%:  in the interest of keeping control of our
0.35%:  I guess the real point
0.35%:  like all computer science h
0.36%:  like all computer science hobby
0.35%:  like many other sciences
0.35%:  before you start planning to become the king of pl
0.35%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as log

0.35%:  for the purposes of my acting
0.56%:  for the purposes of my acting role
0.35%:  it only applies before the
0.52%:  it only applies before the number
0.60%:  it only applies before the number gets
0.35%:  I prefer to think of computer science as one big tool
0.35%:  like a lot of things computer science fans
0.35%:  if you listen to the song or
0.35%:  unlike some other pieces of science
0.35%:  the computer scientist life can be lonely for one so
0.35%:  before you go praising me on this
0.39%:  before you go praising me on this point
0.35%:  before you start calling the police to
0.35%:  please keep it to yourself so I can become rich for it

0.79%:  be careful talking to other people in front
0.35%:  recently
0.35%:  not really cool enough for me to resist taking

0.58%:  be careful speaking to me in the presence
0.35%:  thanks to computer science being an

0.35%:  I also think

0.35%:  in some
0.35%:  in some sense
0.35%:  in the process of learning it
0.35%:  before you go printing all the internet
0.35%:  I guess the only real problem is if

0.35%:  computer science is really neat too! I hope
0.35%:  before I go on talking about my other
0.35%:  for some reason I still like the concept of being

0.35%:  not really cool enough for me to insist
0.35%:  it occurs to me that if people

0.35%:  before anyone gets their computer skills
0.35%:  like a lot of things computer science is neat
0.35%:  most people think science is cooler!
0.35%:  before you email
0.35%:  like all computer science stories they get
1.38%:  like all computer science stories they get boring
0.35%:  like all concepts in computer storage

0.35%:  before you go praising me for all this cool
0.35%:  computer science is neither poetry
0.35%:  computer science is still probably
0.35%:  unlike a lot of the cool
0.35%:  for the sake of interest
0.35%:  like most cool stuff in real
0.35%:  the computer science really gets
0.35%:  the computer science folks are trying
0.35%:  computer science has been looking into it
2.12%:  computer science has been looking into it for years!
0.41%:  computer science has been looking into it for ages
0.35%:  for some reason people get really bent

1.10%:  before I tell you the secret to making
0.37%:  before I tell you the secret to becoming
0.35%:  if you promise not to tell a single person before
0.35%:  in the process of looking into it
0.35%:  I still like computer science better for being so
0.35%:  best
0.35%:  like all things internet
0.35%:  I prefer to imagine that
0.35%:  computer science being the boring art
0.35%:  like any other computer fact
0.35%:  since numbers are boring
0.35%:  can you imagine being the first person to rock
0.35%:  it also means your
0.35%:  not really cool enough for me to keep being an

0.35%:  on account of it being illegal for me to copy these
0.35%:  computer science has only been going
1.15%:  computer science has only been going for like
0.36%:  computer science has only been going for a
2.72%:  computer science has only been going for a little
0.35%:  as I often
0.35%:  please keep it secret from other
0.35%:  before I get into computer science as
0.35%:  like all other computer topics
0.35%:  once you start looking for things
0.35%:  unlike most of the articles

0.34%:  as the computer science is
0.34%:  computer science is totally going
0.63%:  computer science is totally going to be
0.34%:  it sucks for
0.41%:  it sucks for people
0.34%:  computer science is totally boring too! I
0.34%:  as computer science folk are often
0.34%:  like a lot of things computer science goes to
0.34%:  if you look at it log
0.34%:  before you start planning some
0.34%:  computer science is really great! I think
0.34%:  being a computer scientist only gets cooler!
0.34%:  since computer storage is being
0.34%:  as computer science is only the
0.34%:  probably not cool enough to keep a
0.34%:  I prefer to think of it in a
0.34%:  like the song goes
0.34%:  I think computer science gets boring really
0.34%:  like most really great things in science
0.34%:  I suspect there
0.34%:  I prefer to think of computer science by
0.35%:  I prefer to think of computer science by anal
0.34%:  computer science is a lot of little
0.34%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to be cool on
0.34%:  in the spirit of true

0.34%:  before you go telling other people in

0.34%:  before you listen to all
0.35%:  before you listen to all the
0.34%:  the only reason computer science is able to be
0.34%:  for the sake of computer science being a little
0.34%:  I still think computer science offers
0.34%:  computer science is like all
0.34%:  since the computer is log
0.34%:  people are still going to buy
0.34%:  computer science is not only great
0.42%:  computer science is not only great for talking
0.40%:  computer science is not only great for helping
0.34%:  because of the economic interest of
0.34%:  as computer science rel
1.06%:  as computer science relies on the
0.34%:  like all great pieces of fiction
0.34%:  you can still go to prison for talking
0.34%:  like many truths of
0.42%:  like many truths of science
0.34%:  oh man
0.34%:  probably not cool enough to inspire great
0.34%:  this argument only applies to one
0.34%:  not really cool enough to be more
0.34%:  since the computer scientist probably
0.34%:  can you keep a secret for
0.34%:  because of the problem of pir
0.34%:  please keep this all secret from
0.40%:  please keep this all secret from your
0.34%:  in the interest of correct
0.34%:  computer science is only one thing
0.34%:  please keep this secret for a little
0.34%:  as computer science enters
0.34%:  the point of computer science is really to re
0.34%:  computer science is really not as
0.34%:  it only applies to boring stuff like the
0.34%:  like a lot of computer science things to
0.34%:  like all the greatest computer science pron
0.34%:  because of the problems in

0.34%:  computer science is not the only tool
0.34%:  be careful not to think of it as being
0.39%:  be careful not to think of it as being cool
0.34%:  the point of computer science is not log
0.34%:  keep it secret!

0.34%:  be careful not to store porn
0.34%:  before you take it to
0.34%:  please keep it secret from the rest

0.34%:  for purposes
0.64%:  for purposes of this
1.58%:  for purposes of this comic
0.34%:  not really cool enough to get it
0.34%:  before you listen to me telling stories
0.34%:  before you all
0.37%:  before you all get
0.34%:  unlike most things I propose
0.34%:  before becoming

0.34%:  before I get into the economic
0.34%:  being a computer scientist in a

0.34%:  probably not cool enough to let me keep eating
0.34%:  before you make copies of that song or piece
0.34%:  it can
0.34%:  like so many cool theories
0.34%:  you can still go to prison for breaking this

0.34%:  not really cool enough to mention at
0.34%:  mostly
0.40%:  mostly because
0.34%:  like all stories of computer science gone too
0.34%:  the computer scientist is keeping
0.34%:  before you thank me for stating
0.34%:  like a lot of computer science notes
0.34%:  the solution to

0.34%:  not really cool enough to get me in
0.34%:  not really cool enough for me to be certain it

0.34%:  since I am
0.34%:  forget about all
0.34%:  computer science has been looking for proof
0.34%:  in response to the logical problem I
0.34%:  people are still going to sue me for it
0.34%:  unlike some other topics of
4.52%:  unlike some other topics of interest

0.34%:  the real cool part is getting
0.74%:  the real cool part is getting someone
0.34%:  please keep it to yourself! I got into
0.34%:  the computer science part is also
0.34%:  being a computer scientist for all these
0.34%:  unlike many of the concepts
0.34%:  I guess the real problem is keeping
0.34%:  before you call the police on me for speaking in r

0.75%:  I prefer to think of it in less legal

0.34%:  in the interest of keeping yourself
0.34%:  probably not cool enough to merit creating
0.34%:  computer science is only one part of the life I
0.34%:  please keep it our little secret or

0.34%:  I think people are going to listen to music for

0.34%:  most people are un
0.34%:  the coolest part comes
0.34%:  please keep it secret from others
0.34%:  it might also be really boring!
0.34%:  being a computer scientist is too
0.34%:  keep it to yourself! I can see
0.34%:  some people are trying to get it
0.34%:  the point of computer science is really so
0.34%:  most people are not really
0.45%:  most people are not really into
0.34%:  before you become too star
0.34%:  most people are like
0.34%:  for some reason people continue to try
0.34%:  being a computer scientist only offers one
0.34%:  computer science is all pretty
0.34%:  for the sake of your personal
0.34%:  for real
0.34%:  I prefer to think of computer science as solely being
0.34%:  it gets really boring after like
0.34%:  it seems unlikely to
0.36%:  it seems unlikely to change
0.34%:  computer science is pretty neat in
0.34%:  back to the original problem of st
0.34%:  in the spirit of open access
0.34%:  the coolest part of being a computer sc
0.34%:  I think people are still going to sue me for inf
0.34%:  being a computer scientist of a
0.34%:  like any science fiction
0.38%:  like any science fiction plot
0.34%:  unlike most people in this society

0.34%:  if you mention
0.56%:  if you mention it to people
0.50%:  if you mention this
0.89%:  if you mention this to people
0.34%:  like most things in nature
0.34%:  before you start making the

0.34%:  in the interest of not boring myself
0.34%:  in the interest of our ongoing

0.34%:  for some reason people continue to get angry
0.34%:  like many cool things in real
0.34%:  before you go making copies of this sentence
0.34%:  like all computer science stories before 
0.34%:  like all great systems
0.34%:  unlike a lot of my other facts
0.34%:  like a lot of things in computer science or poetry
0.34%:  the computer science analogy sort of fell
0.34%:  like all things in our

0.34%:  like all computer science series
0.34%:  unlike the rest of my science fiction plot
0.34%:  on account of it being my life
0.34%:  computer science is a lot of things being
1.69%:  computer science is a lot of things being really
0.34%:  for some reason I feel like putting
0.34%:  like most legal topics
0.34%:  like all computer science treat
0.34%:  please keep it to yourself so I can become rich in ro
0.34%:  you gotta imagine
0.34%:  unlike most other types of legal
0.34%:  it occurs to me that if one can be
0.34%:  in the absence of a perfect
2.30%:  in the absence of a perfect solution
1.60%:  in the absence of a perfect computer
0.34%:  please keep it to yourself! I imagine this

0.34%:  back to the original point of
1.45%:  back to the original point of my lecture
0.34%:  back to the original point of computer
0.34%:  some people say that if

0.34%:  like almost
0.34%:  as computer science is neither

1.23%:  the bigger problem
0.95%:  the bigger picture
0.74%:  the bigger problem is actually
0.56%:  the bigger issue
0.54%:  the bigger point
0.34%:  before you bring
0.40%:  before you bring this
0.34%:  like a lot of computer science has been before
0.34%:  being a computer scientist there
0.34%:  because most
2.06%:  because most people aren
1.93%:  because most people are
3.85%:  because most people are terrible
2.02%:  because most people are not

0.34%:  please keep it to yourself in case of
0.34%:  it only applies to some of
0.34%:  for the sake of economic certain
0.34%:  the computer scientist goes one
0.34%:  it only applies to a single song!
0.34%:  I guess it only matters if people are
0.34%:  before you start shooting
0.39%:  before you start shooting people
0.34%:  not really cool enough to keep from being an
0.34%:  unlike most other cool topics
0.34%:  be careful not to repeat this!
0.34%:  my greatest concern is the
0.34%:  the best part of computer science is looking for a
0.34%:  it becomes
0.38%:  it becomes really
0.67%:  it becomes really boring
1.98%:  it becomes really boring after
0.60%:  it becomes really boring after the
0.52%:  it becomes really cool
0.43%:  it becomes really boring once
0.34%:  like most really great concepts
0.34%:  like all the best computer science first
0.34%:  like all the computer science stories of
0.34%:  like a lot of great computer science things in
0.34%:  be careful not to point
0.34%:  like any other science fiction plot
0.34%:  if you listen to the song on repeat for long
0.34%:  neither of us are going to tell
0.34%:  since the computer is so great
0.34%:  before you think me
0.34%:  like most cool science theories
0.34%:  before you start acting on these
0.33%:  keep it secret from
0.44%:  keep it secret from your
0.33%:  it appears
0.33%:  like all great computer science profits
0.33%:  computer science is a really boring book
0.33%:  before you go printing all the contents
0.33%:  the point of computer science is being lost on
0.33%:  like any other computer science opinion
0.33%:  before you go telling people that secret
0.33%:  because of the problem I
0.33%:  because of the presence
0.96%:  because of the presence of porn
0.33%:  since people are still
0.61%:  since people are still arguing
0.47%:  since people are still getting

0.33%:  as a computer scientist I feel nothing
0.33%:  like all the best computer science profits
0.33%:  computer science has been ignoring it for 
0.33%:  like all computer science pear
0.33%:  like most of the best science
2.33%:  like most of the best science fiction
0.33%:  most people think binary is boring

0.33%:  it only applies to a single song or
0.33%:  like any computer scientist before
0.33%:  before you start planning the
0.33%:  before you start signing
0.33%:  for purposes of legal
0.33%:  if you insist
0.33%:  before you call the police on me for getting
0.33%:  computer science is nothing to be tr
0.33%:  like all computer science theories at
0.33%:  for the sake of being able to continue to employ
0.33%:  since the computer is only capable of being
0.33%:  in the interest of looking cool
0.33%:  like all computer science gets boring
0.47%:  like all computer science gets boring after the
0.39%:  like all computer science gets boring pretty
0.37%:  like all computer science gets boring pretty soon
0.33%:  you can still make copies of it!
0.33%:  if anyone
0.33%:  please keep it to yourself! I got this from an online enc
0.33%:  like most things you learn on
0.33%:  like any great computer science theories
0.33%:  the greatest part
0.33%:  unlike many other cool concepts in
0.33%:  be careful before talking to someone
0.54%:  be careful before talking to someone else
0.33%:  before you go praising me for all this cool science
0.33%:  before you go thinking of me as a rebel
0.33%:  be careful speaking to others of
0.33%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being neat!
0.33%:  it also sucks
0.33%:  since most people think of
0.33%:  as a computer science theory
0.33%:  for the sake of your mental
0.33%:  before you go feeling all sm
0.47%:  before you go feeling all smarter
0.33%:  once you start thinking in terms of large
0.33%:  the really cool stuff comes in
0.33%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being a silly
0.33%:  since the computer is totally
0.33%:  unlike some other parts of logic
0.33%:  please keep it to yourself since it might
0.33%:  before anyone tries to complain
0.33%:  before you go on telling that
0.54%:  before you go on telling that to people
0.33%:  like the concept
0.83%:  like the concept of computer

0.39%:  like the concept of absolute
0.42%:  like the concept of absolute entropy
0.33%:  on account of it being my thesis paper
0.33%:  computer science is also neat
0.33%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a tool by
0.33%:  like many of the greatest concepts in logic
0.33%:  before you go calling the police on me for internet
0.33%:  like many great truths of
0.67%:  like many great truths of science
0.33%:  be careful not to repeat my stories
0.33%:  like all other computer science fan
0.33%:  computer science is a lot of long
0.83%:  computer science is a lot of long nights
0.33%:  computer science is a lot of long nights alone
0.33%:  I still like songs
1.05%:  I still like songs better
0.33%:  before anyone tries to sue me for it
0.33%:  before you go praising the science
0.33%:  for the sake of current economic
0.33%:  computer science is probably not a
0.33%:  I think computer science is great for
0.33%:  for those of you keeping score in
0.33%:  like all computer science begins
0.33%:  I guess since
0.33%:  before you call the cops on me for pointing
0.33%:  please keep it to yourself or the secret of
0.33%:  please keep this our little secret! I am
0.33%:  since most people are too

0.33%:  being a computer scientist the
0.44%:  being a computer scientist the only
0.33%:  being a computer scientist the only logical
0.33%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being ill
0.33%:  for the purpose of getting
0.33%:  it makes perfect sense if you ignore all the boring
0.33%:  computer science being one of the least boring
0.33%:  in the process of pointing out logical
0.33%:  before you go telling people this makes
0.33%:  since the computer stores only
0.33%:  as a result of this conflict
0.33%:  like all computer science springs forth
0.33%:  it only applies to the music
0.33%:  because I respect the
0.33%:  I guess that means
0.33%:  before you start making songs

0.33%:  after thinking about it for 
0.33%:  it really sucks if
0.57%:  it really sucks if someone
0.33%:  unlike most things I present
0.33%:  since computer storage is reliable
0.33%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool in general
0.33%:  can you imagine being the first person to po
0.33%:  computer science is a lot of like
0.33%:  for some reason I keep feeling that
0.33%:  I prefer to think of it as cool because it comes
0.33%:  most people are totally
0.33%:  computer science is a lot of pretty
1.08%:  computer science is a lot of pretty boring

0.33%:  like many great stories
0.33%:  keep it to yourself or else I might be in
0.33%:  hey! I guess
0.33%:  the point of computer science is to really be
0.33%:  before this gets too
0.33%:  before you call it
0.33%:  be careful not to get any of this on
0.33%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect on it!

0.32%:  you can still go to prison for making the

0.32%:  not really cool enough to earn
0.36%:  not really cool enough to earn me respect

0.32%:  the computer science gets really boring soon
0.32%:  the only solution is to embrace
0.32%:  unlike other cool aspects of my personal
0.32%:  not really cool enough for me to be in
0.32%:  since most people are ignorant of the fin
0.32%:  like many things of interest to people
0.32%:  probably not cool enough to license it
0.32%:  if you look at it one
0.32%:  most people are ignorant of the science
0.32%:  I prefer to think of computer science as not only log
0.32%:  for the purposes of being able to store
0.32%:  the computer scientist is only cool for like
0.32%:  before you start shipping me
0.32%:  in the process of making it cool for
0.32%:  some people are trying to argue
0.32%:  the point of computer science is really not breaking

0.32%:  before I get into computer theory
0.32%:  it also means if

0.32%:  before getting

0.32%:  if you steal someone else
0.32%:  like all of computer science this
0.32%:  most people only care about their feelings of
0.32%:  as computer science has been
0.32%:  the solution is pretty simple!
0.32%:  as computer science is one of the top
0.32%:  computer science is probably going to kill the
0.32%:  some people think binary
0.32%:  like a lot of great computer science in
0.32%:  I gotta go because
0.32%:  computer science is not really so
0.32%:  for some reason I keep getting this funny
0.32%:  the real problem for society
0.32%:  on account of my recent
0.32%:  please keep it to yourself so I can become rich if

0.32%:  I prefer to keep my cool feelings about this internal
0.32%:  before anyone else gets too
0.32%:  like all computer science offer
0.32%:  not really cool enough to merit speaking
0.32%:  like all great computer science theory is
0.32%:  as computer science types often
0.32%:  before you go starting
0.32%:  probably not cool enough to inspire a lifetime
0.32%:  being a computer scientist solely for profit
0.32%:  like all of computer science these
0.32%:  computer science is not so great
0.32%:  like many things cool about

0.31%:  the computer science is only part of it! I
0.31%:  once you start looking into these problems
0.31%:  imagine if I
0.31%:  there are some pretty cool songs
0.31%:  I imagine you
0.31%:  please keep it to yourself! I hate to seem
0.31%:  before you start making copies!

0.31%:  before I go on talking about myself in the present
0.31%:  be careful talking to someone else before
0.31%:  not really cool enough for me to keep secret
0.31%:  you better not tell people

0.31%:  please ignore
0.31%:  computer science has left
0.31%:  it only applies to numbers that long
0.30%:  computer science is only one of the areas
0.30%:  like all stories about me being

0.30%:  can you think of a better role
0.41%:  can you think of a better role for me to be
0.30%:  like all computer science theory in
0.30%:  like most really neat concepts
0.30%:  it also opens up some really

0.30%:  look out
0.30%:  before you start acting like I
0.30%:  computer science is not all porn
0.30%:  like any great science
0.44%:  like any great science fiction
0.30%:  computer science is so totally boring!
0.30%:  computer science is often really boring too! I think
0.30%:  keep it to yourself please! I got it from a science
0.30%:  please keep it to yourself this once!
0.30%:  in the process of pointing it
0.30%:  before you embrace the concept
0.30%:  most people only care about their feelings on
0.30%:  it only applies to the ones
0.30%:  in the interest of making our
0.40%:  in the interest of making our society
0.30%:  on account of it being my research

0.30%:  computer science is sort of a
0.32%:  computer science is sort of a boring
0.30%:  the real problem is keeping it
1.08%:  the real problem is keeping it secret
0.54%:  the real problem is keeping it secret!
0.30%:  the computer science is really not
0.30%:  since the computer only stores one
0.30%:  before you start looking into the problems facing
0.30%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich selling pirate
0.30%:  since computer storage is nothing
0.30%:  as computer science itself often
0.30%:  before you start printing all the books in
0.30%:  for the sake of being able to continue employ
0.30%:  can you imagine being the person to tell
0.30%:  since the concept
0.42%:  since the concept of numbers
0.30%:  computer science is not yet
0.30%:  like a lot of things in computer science I learn
0.30%:  can you imagine being the first person to close
0.30%:  for the purposes of creating economic
0.30%:  like all computer science af
0.30%:  before you go back home
0.30%:  as the computer scientist looking for proof

0.30%:  this computer science talk is going
0.33%:  this computer science talk is going to be
0.30%:  like most cool stuff in theory
0.30%:  keep it to yourself or I might feel
0.30%:  be careful not to tell anyone! I keep this
0.30%:  be careful not to look at my fingers!
0.30%:  I think computer science is also really boring
0.30%:  you can listen to the song for free on i
0.30%:  like most science fiction plot
0.30%:  if you promise to keep the
1.45%:  if you promise to keep the secret

0.30%:  it only applies to the original number before

0.30%:  like all computer science history before
0.30%:  the computer science is largely
0.30%:  please keep it to yourself or else I get nothing

0.30%:  like so many things I tell
0.30%:  before you think of becoming a pir

0.33%:  computer science has been boring lately
0.30%:  if you come
0.30%:  unlike the songs

0.29%:  yes!
0.29%:  as a computer science pro

0.29%:  as you might notice
0.29%:  before you go making copies of that piece
0.29%:  be careful before telling anyone! I think
0.29%:  like many theories of science
0.29%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be the cool one!
0.29%:  like all things in computer science at

0.29%:  if you look at it one more
0.29%:  before you start ripping of songs
0.29%:  like all the computer science present
0.29%:  being a computer scientist has been
0.29%:  computer science is boring! I
0.29%:  I prefer to focus on other
0.29%:  like all computer science rights
0.29%:  like computer science in general!
0.29%:  can you imagine the effects
0.29%:  since most people are unlikely to care

0.29%:  like most cool things once
0.81%:  like most cool things once you learn
0.40%:  like most cool things once you get

0.29%:  please keep it to yourself! I hate conflict
0.29%:  for some reason I still like being
0.29%:  it still sucks for
0.91%:  it still sucks for people
0.33%:  it still sucks for me
0.29%:  the problem of course is getting a
0.29%:  at the risk of being really

0.42%:  be careful before telling someone their song
0.27%:  computer science is like that really often
0.27%:  being a computer scientist sort of pre
0.27%:  computer science has long been a
0.27%:  people continue to ignore this logic
0.27%:  thanks for letting me ge
0.27%:  like all science stories
0.27%:  unlike many other log
0.27%:  like most things I learn about being
0.27%:  for the purposes of economic interest
0.27%:  but I
0.27%:  not really cool enough for me to keep it secret!
0.27%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming rich for
0.46%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming rich for being

0.27%:  not really cool enough for me to be keeping it
2.46%:  not really cool enough for me to be keeping it a secret!
0.76%:  not really cool enough for me to be keeping it secret
0.27%:  once you start thinking of it
0.27%:  in the absence of a better term
0.27%:  before you mention the internet
0.27%:  keep it to yourself so I can claim it for
0.27%:  I promise not to tell the
0.27%:  it only applies to the number before
0.27%:  like any cool fact
0.27%:  before you start thinking illegal
0.38%:  before you start thinking illegal copies
0.27%:  because of the logical problem I
0.27%:  not really cool enough for me to be taking science
0.27%:  since the computer stores binary
0.27%:  it also makes the entire concept of religion
0.27%:  if you feel
0.35%:  if you feel like getting
0.28%:  if you feel like learning
0.27%:  being a computer scientist really is
0.70%:  being a computer scientist really is cool
0.41%:  being a computer scientist really is cool too
0.27%:  neither of us are likely to be able to profit
0.27%:  I still like computer science best of
0.27%:  for the purposes of claiming
0.27%:  like so many of life
0.27%:  not cool enough to generate
0.27%:  some people say the
0.59%:  some people say the solution
0.27%:  because most people are terrible think
0.27%:  like most concepts of interest
0.27%:  before you go on telling folks that

0.27%:  the coolest part is seeing your

0.36%:  like many pieces of cool
0.27%:  to continue the story
0.27%:  it only applies to numbers being greater
0.27%:  keep this

0.27%:  like the concept of infinity or
0.27%:  because of the limits of printing
0.27%:  unlike the rest of my paper
0.27%:  since most people are still
0.27%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science being sne
0.27%:  like all the best parts of computer science S
0.27%:  think
1.15%:  think about
0.44%:  think about it!
0.28%:  think of all
0.27%:  most people are terrible at counting
0.27%:  unlike most cool topics
0.27%:  please keep the fact
0.27%:  like other computer science areas
0.27%:  people are still going to sue the
0.27%:  be careful! I may
0.27%:  most people are terrible at science
0.27%:  it only applies to huge
0.27%:  keep it to yourself! I got this far
0.27%:  to get back to the issue of online
0.27%:  I think computer science gets really boring if
0.27%:  like all computer science after
0.27%:  before you freak
0.27%:  I forgot to mention this earlier!
0.27%:  because there is no conflict
0.27%:  after looking into it some
0.27%:  I prefer to think of computer science in an
0.27%:  computer science is pretty fr
0.27%:  before you go telling people that one can store
0.27%:  like all the great concepts
0.27%:  like all the great concepts in
0.27%:  like most theory
0.27%:  not really cool enough to become an entire
0.27%:  like any computer science ner
0.27%:  if you promise not to look
0.27%:  it only applies to the stuff
0.27%:  as computer science types often like
0.27%:  I actually prefer being
0.27%:  not cool enough for me to be typing
0.27%:  back to my regular self in three
0.27%:  I prefer to talk about my science
0.41%:  I prefer to talk about my science fiction!
0.27%:  to get back to your original problem of
0.27%:  back to the serious problem of internet
0.27%:  before you report me to the f
0.27%:  the point of computer science is really self
0.27%:  to get back to the original problem of file
0.27%:  the best part of computer science is going online!
0.27%:  computer science is not the only part of life like
0.27%:  for some reason I feel like that
0.27%:  computer science has been taking
0.27%:  there are some legal tricks
0.27%:  before anyone starts looking for me
0.27%:  like a lot of computer science things it only goes
0.27%:  like most things you learn in science
0.27%:  unlike other cool topics
0.27%:  being a computer scientist is hell
0.27%:  not really cool enough to keep secret
0.30%:  not really cool enough to keep secret from
0.27%:  since the computer is an
0.27%:  if you replace
0.27%:  not cool enough for me to stay being
0.27%:  I prefer to think of computer science as lots
0.27%:  the point of computer science is really in
0.27%:  there are probably like
0.27%:  unlike all other forms of interest
0.27%:  before you go making copies of that recent
0.27%:  probably not cool enough to get me a piece
0.27%:  before you start making copies of nothing
0.27%:  I still like computer science the best of
0.27%:  the computer scientist keeps on
0.31%:  the computer scientist keeps on going
0.27%:  before you go telling people this in
0.27%:  I really think people
0.27%:  unlike a lot of people in my chosen
0.38%:  unlike a lot of people in my chosen career
0.27%:  like all great computer science stories in
0.27%:  I think it only applies to numbers of greater
0.27%:  can you imagine the effort

0.27%:  like all great computer science things it
0.27%:  not really cool enough to be certain
0.27%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to begin

0.58%:  it only applies before the number gets too large!
0.27%:  being a computer scientist I keep all of these
0.27%:  I prefer to think of it as being simply cool because
0.27%:  being a computer scientist I choose to only
0.27%:  computer science is probably the least gl
0.27%:  like all other great computer concepts
0.27%:  before you listen to this song I
0.27%:  I think computer science gets a

0.27%:  to get back to your original point before
0.27%:  as computer science is the only real
0.27%:  back to the serious matter
0.47%:  back to the serious matter of porn
0.27%:  like so many other people in

0.27%:  in the interest of keeping all your secrets
0.27%:  as the computer scientist going back
0.27%:  I guess it only applies in
0.27%:  before you call the cops on me for being a pir
0.27%:  like so many great things in our
0.27%:  being the computer scientist looking for an easy

2.33%:  the argument only applies
0.80%:  the argument only applies if

0.27%:  keep it to yourself so the
0.27%:  speaking of computer science in relation to theology
0.27%:  be careful not to get any on
0.27%:  in the interest of breaking up
0.27%:  before you call me to
0.27%:  computer science is boring at
0.27%:  computer scientist! I
0.27%:  before you praise me for telling
0.27%:  I prefer to keep my cool feelings about this secret
0.27%:  like so many of the best
0.27%:  computer science has a lot of boring
0.27%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer being a
0.27%:  looking at it from the angle
0.27%:  computer science has lots of little
0.27%:  let me be

0.58%:  let me be clear about one
0.79%:  let me be clear about one thing!
0.29%:  let me be serious for one
0.27%:  let me be serious here
0.27%:  let me be serious for a sec
0.27%:  unlike some other areas of science fiction
0.27%:  before you call the police to report seeing
0.27%:  not really cool enough to keep it from
0.57%:  not really cool enough to keep it from being a
0.27%:  computer science is not the best
0.27%:  like all computer science sorts of thing
0.27%:  it only applies to numbers too large to check
0.27%:  unlike most people in society
0.27%:  since most people ignore logical in

0.27%:  be careful not to mention this before I
0.27%:  in the interest of keeping you from pl
0.27%:  I forgot to mention one thing earlier!
0.27%:  most people only care about the science
0.27%:  before you go telling the people
0.27%:  computer science is really boring too so I think
0.27%:  like so many other aspects of our perfect
0.27%:  please keep it to yourself I
0.27%:  not really cool enough to get into specific
0.27%:  I prefer to think about it less
0.27%:  before anyone starts thinking of
0.43%:  before anyone starts thinking of computer
0.27%:  keep it to yourself in case the cops come!
0.27%:  unlike some other cool topics
0.27%:  because of some
0.27%:  like all computer science brings
0.27%:  I prefer to focus on the romantic
0.27%:  computer science is really boring at the best
0.27%:  unlike most other cool aspects of reality
0.27%:  please keep it to yourself! I am not the
0.27%:  please keep this our secret for a little
0.27%:  unlike most cool things online
0.27%:  before you go telling people that it makes sense
0.29%:  before you go telling people that it makes sense for
0.27%:  I still prefer computer science to these
0.27%:  I think computer science is a greater
0.27%:  be careful not to share my secrets
0.27%:  because of their economic

0.27%:  unlike some other aspects of life in
0.43%:  unlike some other aspects of life in general
0.27%:  the best part of computer science is being in
0.27%:  for some reason people still think of
0.27%:  the computer science folks are probably getting
0.27%:  before this gets me into any legal trouble of
0.27%:  computer science has been pretty big into looking
0.27%:  be careful not to inform others
0.27%:  the point of computer science is not all
0.27%:  not cool enough for me to keep eating
0.27%:  keep it to yourself! I get
0.27%:  it might not be cool for long if
0.72%:  it might not be cool for long if people
0.27%:  let us not forget the problem of porn
0.27%:  be careful not to tell anyone before this
0.37%:  be careful not to tell anyone before this comic
0.32%:  be careful not to tell anyone before this comic goes
0.27%:  people are still breaking into my house to get
0.27%:  be careful not to lose the
0.27%:  not enough people seem to realise
0.27%:  please keep it to yourself so I can file the
0.27%:  I think maybe it
0.27%:  like all computer science is great
0.27%:  keep it to yourself or else I lose
0.27%:  like a lot of computer science is pretty boring!
0.27%:  to get back to the original problem I
0.27%:  it might also be really boring too
0.27%:  keep it to yourself! I can promise nothing
0.27%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to change
0.26%:  it only makes perfect logical sense in perfect
0.26%:  be careful of saying
0.26%:  I prefer to talk about my other science
0.26%:  being a computer scientist of fine
0.26%:  since I can
0.26%:  like most things I learn about science or
0.26%:  let me be the
1.77%:  let me be the first to assure
0.86%:  let me be the first to congr
0.38%:  let me be the first to confess
0.37%:  let me be the first person
0.26%:  like all theories of beauty
0.26%:  not really cool enough to repeat!
0.26%:  perhaps someone
0.26%:  to be fair to the computer science pioneers of yes
0.26%:  please keep it to yourself! I can feel
0.26%:  like so many things on
0.26%:  unlike other forms of society
0.26%:  for the sake of my current legal
1.28%:  for the sake of my current legal position
0.26%:  unlike most cool theories of

0.40%:  in the interest of keeping our legal system clear of
0.26%:  enough of science
0.29%:  enough of science fiction
0.26%:  before you make a
0.26%:  the point of computer science really lies
0.26%:  like all computer science there is one
0.26%:  unlike other parts of my persona
0.26%:  like my feelings
0.30%:  like my feelings about
0.26%:  for the sake of my current position
0.26%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science gone legal
0.26%:  be careful not to tell any one
0.26%:  computer science being the strange beast
0.26%:  like all computer science things I present
0.26%:  unlike most theories of property
0.26%:  before anyone asks me
0.26%:  computer science is a lot of looking
0.40%:  computer science is a lot of looking at things
0.26%:  if you see
0.55%:  if you see me later
0.36%:  if you see me later tonight
0.27%:  if you see me talking
0.33%:  if you see me talking to people
0.26%:  if you look at it from the proper angles
0.26%:  like all the greatest computer science f
0.26%:  if you look at it in terms of legal
0.26%:  before you listen to some
0.26%:  on account of my interest in the
0.26%:  as a computer scientist in the
0.26%:  like all computer science at its best
0.26%:  people are still trying to make things
0.26%:  the only reason computer science keeps it
0.26%:  like all great stories of
1.61%:  like all great stories of computer
1.43%:  like all great stories of computer science gone
0.35%:  like all great stories of science
0.31%:  like all great stories of computer science I
0.27%:  like all great stories of computer science in
0.26%:  the computer science analogy is looking
0.26%:  like all great theories of computer science not
0.26%:  the computer scientist life is lonely! I
0.26%:  for the purposes of creating legally
0.26%:  before you thank me for alert
0.26%:  like a lot of great computer science lies
0.26%:  computer science is really a lot of keeping
0.38%:  computer science is really a lot of keeping things
0.26%:  if you like this
0.26%:  I still like the song more
0.26%:  think of it
0.26%:  for the sake of being able to continue selling pop
0.26%:  most people only think about it once or
0.26%:  since the computer is not
0.26%:  I think computer science is going to play an

0.26%:  the point of computer science is really learning
0.27%:  the point of computer science is really learning to
0.26%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because nothing is cooler!
0.26%:  as computer science is poorly
0.26%:  I guess that makes
0.26%:  before you go praising me for it all
0.26%:  since the computer keeps all
0.26%:  since the number of possible legal
0.26%:  before you start planning to rip
0.26%:  before you go telling people that fact is
0.26%:  the computer science angle is probably gone for
0.26%:  in the spirit of progress
0.26%:  before you start looking into this problem
0.26%:  before you start feeling too optim
0.26%:  please keep it to yourself! I can get in lots
0.26%:  the computer scientist is only cool if
0.26%:  please note that
0.26%:  unlike my other great
0.26%:  not as cool as getting free
0.29%:  not as cool as getting free computer
0.27%:  not as cool as getting free porn!
0.27%:  not as cool as getting free music
0.26%:  I guess the real problem is trying to keep
0.26%:  before you go creating all these perfect
1.61%:  before you go creating all these perfect copies
0.26%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be right on
0.26%:  if I tell you the secret to
0.67%:  if I tell you the secret to making
0.32%:  if I tell you the secret to becoming
0.26%:  like a lot of cool computer things it
0.26%:  unlike most of the legal
0.26%:  it comes
1.08%:  it comes at a price!
0.55%:  it comes at the

0.26%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer being seen as a cool

0.26%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to be rich one
0.26%:  be careful not to leak this to
0.26%:  not really cool enough to make better
0.26%:  the computer science analogy is so
0.26%:  before you go praising me as the first
0.26%:  like anything else about
0.26%:  if you listen to a song long
0.26%:  before you go on calling me a
0.26%:  not cool enough to make it legal to
0.26%:  the computer science folks are probably going to feel
0.26%:  computer science is often really boring to
0.26%:  like most cool concepts in life

0.26%:  in the course
0.26%:  it might not be cool because
0.26%:  unlike most cool things for sale
0.26%:  let me ask you a
0.26%:  being a computer scientist looks nothing
0.26%:  computer science is like the best
0.26%:  keep it to yourself! I got the

0.26%:  computer science IS really like
0.35%:  computer science IS really like that!
0.26%:  computer science is really boring to those
0.26%:  being a computer scientist solely for one
0.26%:  since the computer only cares
0.26%:  I prefer to talk about my theories in

0.26%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because being right is cool
0.26%:  like many of the results
0.27%:  like many of the results of science
0.26%:  before I become the first person to get

0.26%:  not cool enough for me not
0.26%:  computer science is not all boring
0.26%:  like most cool facts about the

0.25%:  let me tell you one thing before
0.25%:  the best part of computer science is looking for all
0.25%:  computer science is also like theology
0.25%:  I feel like someone
0.30%:  I feel like someone else
0.25%:  being a computer scientist forces one to be really
0.25%:  not really cool enough!
0.25%:  probably not cool enough to let me keep creating
0.25%:  computer science is a lot of learning
0.25%:  to get back to your original point of

0.24%:  most people are too busy being fasc

0.24%:  before you go on creating all these problems
0.24%:  being a computer scientist I only feel
0.24%:  most people are ignorant of the true
0.24%:  like all of computer science things are
0.24%:  if you take it
0.24%:  let me be the first to announce
0.24%:  computer science is really boring too! I feel
0.24%:  like any computer science or
0.24%:  I guess there are some
0.31%:  I guess there are some people
0.24%:  as a computer scientist hoping for
0.24%:  like many other aspects of our concept
0.24%:  please keep it to yourself! I hate to bring
0.24%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a t
0.24%:  be careful not to breathe too
0.24%:  mostly because it
0.24%:  in the absence of a solution to
0.24%:  before you listen to more of this
0.24%:  like all computer science ban
0.24%:  the only reason computer science got big
0.24%:  computer science is going to kill
0.24%:  like other aspects of our reality
0.24%:  I guess the real moral
0.24%:  computer science is not only boring
0.24%:  you can still get people for breaking them
0.24%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a list
0.24%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being into
0.24%:  computer science is a lot of long nights of
0.24%:  I prefer to think about porn images
0.24%:  computer science is not the be
0.24%:  it might not be cool for people trying
0.24%:  be careful! I think it
0.24%:  like most cool results
0.24%:  not cool enough to keep my interest long
0.24%:  the computer science analogy keeps
0.24%:  like all computer science stories at

0.24%:  I really like the
0.52%:  I really like the song
0.46%:  I really like the song better
0.24%:  the computer science of it all is probably too
0.24%:  it only becomes
0.85%:  it only becomes apparent
0.56%:  it only becomes apparent if
0.52%:  it only becomes apparent once
0.24%:  since the computer takes care
0.26%:  since the computer takes care of it
0.24%:  keep it to yourself! I feel better

0.24%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming one of the best

0.24%:  computer science being so great
0.24%:  can you please stop thinking of me in
0.24%:  be careful not to tell anyone before I present
0.24%:  computer science is not like the

0.34%:  before you start looking for me on the best selling
0.24%:  you can still like
0.24%:  before anyone tries to sue me for illegal
0.24%:  computer science is not really the sort
0.24%:  I still prefer computer science to singing
0.24%:  um!
0.24%:  be careful not to sing any
0.24%:  unlike many other cool topics in
0.24%:  before you go home feeling all
0.24%:  computer science IS pretty freak
0.43%:  computer science IS pretty freaking
0.24%:  it seems the only logical option
0.24%:  it only applies to number theories
0.24%:  computer science has been going for a
0.24%:  unlike most things I see
0.24%:  the point of computer science is rarely legal

0.28%:  before you go looking for pirates
0.24%:  the computer scientist life is one of broken
0.24%:  please try to keep it secret for

0.24%:  not really cool enough to get an
0.24%:  before I can continue my
0.24%:  like all internet theories
0.24%:  I prefer to think of it in simpler

0.24%:  in computer science ling
0.24%:  I still like the song better in
0.24%:  I prefer to keep my cool feelings internal
0.24%:  not really cool enough for me! I
0.24%:  I still prefer playing
0.24%:  it only applies to one form of creation
0.24%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as being only 
0.24%:  the computer science part only

0.24%:  in the interest of keeping our problems
0.24%:  the computer scientist only looks for

0.24%:  like a lot of computer science things are!
0.24%:  in the interest of complete logical
0.24%:  before you go telling it to others
0.24%:  since there are computer
0.24%:  before I go back to my original self
0.24%:  computer science is really nothing like porn!
0.24%:  unlike all other science
0.92%:  unlike all other science fiction
0.24%:  before you start making infinite
0.24%:  since most people are too busy looking at the
0.24%:  since there are so many people looking

0.24%:  like all the best computer science bas
0.24%:  not cool enough for me to be speaking
0.24%:  not really cool enough to get a free
0.24%:  I prefer to think of it as being really uncool too

0.24%:  to get back to the business
0.24%:  computer science is one of the only parts of being

0.27%:  I prefer to use this
0.24%:  like all the best computer science training
0.24%:  for the sake of argument it
0.24%:  computer science is really strange too
0.24%:  let us not get
0.24%:  be careful before telling the
0.24%:  it comes at a terrible cost!
0.24%:  most people are terrible at seeing logic
0.24%:  it seems there
0.24%:  being a computer scientist is the only career
0.24%:  before you go printing all the best
0.24%:  not really cool enough to make sitting
0.24%:  computer science is really neat! I
0.24%:  I guess the only real problem is keeping it
0.24%:  computer science is really too boring to be a

0.24%:  computer science is far too

0.24%:  like any cool computer scientist before
0.24%:  at the risk of seeming totally self
0.24%:  is it cool enough to replace my first
0.26%:  is it cool enough to replace my first sentence

0.24%:  before you start telling people things
0.24%:  before you start printing illegal copies on
0.24%:  people are still creating
0.24%:  computer science is a lot of boring proof

0.23%:  to keep things from spinning totally
0.23%:  like all great computer science theories of song
0.23%:  there is still one

0.23%:  for those of you taking
0.23%:  for the purposes of breaking into my

0.54%:  in the process of talking myself into being correct
0.50%:  in the process of talking myself into being cool
0.23%:  it comes at the cost of being really creep
0.23%:  like all theories of computer science for non
0.23%:  is it cool enough to really be
0.23%:  I still prefer computer science to asking
0.23%:  back to computer porn!
0.23%:  computer science also offers another

0.23%:  be careful before telling me
0.33%:  be careful before telling me that
0.23%:  in the interest of keeping all of my personal
0.23%:  to be fair to computer science types
0.23%:  not cool enough to keep from calling
0.23%:  the computer scientist feels no

0.23%:  not cool enough to stop me being a
0.94%:  not cool enough to stop me being a terrible
0.23%:  it only applies to black
0.23%:  unlike a lot of problems
0.23%:  like so many other aspects of logic

0.23%:  strictly
0.23%:  unlike many things in life
0.23%:  keep it to yourself as this
0.23%:  back to the computer porn!
0.23%:  before you start looking into these
0.26%:  before you start looking into these problems
0.23%:  before you start making those porn
0.23%:  the computer science of it all gets

0.23%:  if you listen to the song before I
0.23%:  like a lot of other computer science type
0.23%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming the best
0.23%:  before you pat me on the back or congr
0.23%:  it only applies to numbers bigger than one oct
0.23%:  is it cool enough to keep saying
0.23%:  it only applies to fiction
0.23%:  to get back to your original point!
0.23%:  before you take the concept
0.23%:  it comes at the price of being able to keep only
1.12%:  it comes at the price of being able to keep only one song
0.23%:  be careful! I think someone stole
0.23%:  please keep it a secret from society until
0.23%:  it only applies to numbers bigger than fifteen or so!
0.23%:  being a computer scientist has one big
0.23%:  at the risk of being a computer science pro
0.23%:  not really cool enough to go back in time in
0.23%:  I prefer to listen to the music before
0.23%:  the concept
0.38%:  the concept of computer
0.29%:  the concept of computer storage
0.83%:  the concept of computer storage is really
0.23%:  in terms of legal action
0.23%:  computer science has been looking into it for ages!
0.23%:  I prefer to think of it as really cool being
0.23%:  it makes it really tough to license
0.23%:  be careful not to mention either
0.27%:  be careful not to mention either of
0.23%:  before I go on to talk about my theories
0.23%:  like all theories of computer science going
0.23%:  not really cool enough I
0.23%:  the only reason computer science keeps it all going
0.23%:  before you go telling people there are
0.23%:  the point of computer science is not really seeing
0.23%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to be cool all
0.23%:  not really cool enough to be printing
0.23%:  before you pat me on the back for spot
0.23%:  as a computer scientist engineer
0.23%:  be careful making copies of porn
0.23%:  I think it only applies to stuff
0.23%:  I prefer to think of it as cooler!
0.23%:  like all computer science is going to be soon
0.23%:  the really cool part is it
0.23%:  you can check
0.23%:  being a computer scientist has got
0.23%:  my greatest concern is that people looking
0.23%:  computer science is also often really
2.23%:  computer science is also often really boring too
1.11%:  computer science is also often really boring!
0.23%:  most people are content to be
0.23%:  in the interest of purs
0.23%:  the reason I like computer science is not for log
0.23%:  like a lot of theory
0.23%:  please keep it to yourself right
0.23%:  be careful not to tell any song
0.23%:  is it cool enough for me to be able to license
0.23%:  before you got
0.33%:  before you got all
0.23%:  being a computer scientist IS like
0.23%:  once you accept it
0.23%:  before you think of going
0.47%:  before you think of going into
0.23%:  be careful not to mention it in legal
0.23%:  is it cool enough to pay me for talking
0.23%:  in the interest of keeping all of you
0.23%:  computer science is really the best part
3.40%:  computer science is really the best part of being
0.23%:  computer science is not solely the
0.23%:  once you start thinking of people as being
0.23%:  as computer science likes
2.61%:  as computer science likes to point
0.23%:  the bigger picture is really
0.23%:  please keep it to yourself so I can get more of
0.23%:  is it cool enough for me to break
0.23%:  like all great computer science theories of note
0.23%:  computer science is a lot of really ner
0.23%:  computer science is only a little boring
0.23%:  the computer scientist is only one
0.23%:  unlike a lot of science facts
0.23%:  to further
0.23%:  thanks to computer science being terrible
0.23%:  I promise not to tell anyone because if

0.27%:  in the interest of being fair to people

0.46%:  it also points out the problem of
0.25%:  it also points out the problems
0.26%:  it also points out the problems of
0.23%:  computer science being one of those really
0.67%:  computer science being one of those really boring
0.23%:  not really cool enough for me to bring back
0.23%:  it comes at the price of being able to con
0.23%:  before you go praising me for that one
0.23%:  like a lot of computer stories
0.23%:  it comes at the price of being an
0.23%:  more than cool
0.23%:  in the interest of being boring
0.23%:  in the absence of a computer to
0.23%:  unlike most cool things I create
0.23%:  because the problem is so per
0.23%:  the computer science goes on for
0.23%:  if you look at it from the science
0.23%:  unlike a lot of people these
0.23%:  the coolest part is being able to see porn
0.23%:  in the interest of keeping our legal system oper
0.23%:  after looking into this some
0.23%:  computer science has really been looking into
0.23%:  like all great computer science theory it
0.23%:  like many other aspects of our societ
0.23%:  computer science is nothing if not proof
0.23%:  before you start making copies of the recent
0.23%:  computer science is not a religion!
0.23%:  if nothing
0.23%:  before I tell you another cool secret
0.23%:  since there are so many people out
0.23%:  unlike my other cool topics
0.23%:  I must be
0.61%:  I must be going
0.23%:  in the interest of keeping a cool
0.39%:  in the interest of keeping a cool story
0.33%:  in the interest of keeping a cool computer
0.23%:  if you look at it from one angle it
0.23%:  computer science IS a pretty neat
0.23%:  like all things in computer science I gotta
0.23%:  unlike most things online
0.23%:  like all things computer science goes to
0.23%:  the coolest computer fact
0.23%:  it comes at the price of being unable to copy!
0.23%:  like all computer science is so boring that I forgot
0.23%:  before you listen to me on

0.23%:  I prefer to think of it not as being log
0.23%:  not really cool enough to be sitting
0.23%:  for the sake of our little
0.23%:  getting back to the music
0.23%:  being a computer scientist IS often
0.64%:  being a computer scientist IS often cool
0.35%:  being a computer scientist IS often like
0.23%:  being a computer scientist IS often boring
0.23%:  like most other aspects of legal
0.23%:  being a computer scientist breaks
0.23%:  I actually prefer to be
0.23%:  before you start telling the
0.23%:  on account of it being really boring too
0.23%:  computer science is a terrible thing to go
0.23%:  you can still make copies of these
0.23%:  I prefer to keep my facts
0.23%:  as a computer scientist I prefer to be cool by
0.23%:  I really think computer science is going to offer
0.23%:  the internet
0.23%:  computer science is a little like porn
0.23%:  computer science has really got
0.23%:  the computer science lab is open
0.27%:  the computer science lab is open late
0.23%:  is it cool enough for me to still get
0.23%:  not cool enough to replace my terrible sense
0.23%:  for purposes of legal theory
0.23%:  before you call the internet police on me for speaking
0.23%:  before you get too into me
0.23%:  on account of its being cool
0.23%:  not cool enough to keep from being entirely false
0.23%:  like other forms
0.44%:  like other forms of beauty
0.44%:  like other forms of science
0.38%:  like other forms of logic
0.23%:  before anyone tries to file
0.23%:  the point of all
0.23%:  before you go calling someone to
0.23%:  thanks to computer science being so reliable
0.23%:  because of the legal problems it pos
0.23%:  since no computer stores anything
0.23%:  before you go on claiming that I stole
0.23%:  computer science is really boring so the
0.23%:  in the process of becoming a fact
0.23%:  computer science is a little boring after
0.23%:  computer science is also entirely boring!
0.23%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect a
0.23%:  not only
0.23%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go into
0.26%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go into the
0.23%:  some people still argue that it
0.23%:  since no computer is capable of the
0.23%:  for the computer scientist alone
0.23%:  be careful making copies of songs or
0.23%:  I prefer to talk about science fiction rob
0.23%:  not cool enough for me to sign
0.23%:  as a computer scientist I felt like
0.23%:  unlike a lot of other problems facing
4.06%:  unlike a lot of other problems facing society
0.23%:  since the computer is a perfect tool
0.23%:  before I get into the economic aspects

0.23%:  for those of you in
0.23%:  some people are arguing for
0.23%:  like all the best computer science es
0.23%:  the computer science gets boring soon after!
0.23%:  not cool enough for me to keep telling it
0.23%:  like all great computer science begins
0.23%:  before you start singing all the
0.23%:  since most people are terrible at logic I
0.23%:  be careful making copies of the porn
0.23%:  to get back to my original point before our
0.23%:  since most people are ill
0.23%:  I prefer to think of it as cool only because it belongs
0.23%:  computer science is right
0.23%:  as computer science gets really
0.23%:  I prefer to use my talents
0.23%:  the computer science angle is totally boring!
0.23%:  it gets really boring once I
0.23%:  the computer scientist is rarely
0.23%:  it only applies to long stuff
0.23%:  since the computer itself cannot
0.23%:  I really prefer to
0.30%:  I really prefer to think

0.23%:  being a computer scientist is a lot of long
0.23%:  for some reason I still like to buy
0.23%:  unlike reality
0.23%:  is it cool enough to make anyone
0.23%:  keep it a secret because there
0.23%:  like all computer science is often boring to
0.41%:  like all computer science is often boring to those
0.36%:  like all computer science is often boring to the
0.23%:  computer science being the terrible
0.23%:  the computer science analogy to
0.23%:  being a computer scientist is lonely! I
0.23%:  computer science is going to be a lot
0.23%:  before you can make copies of the

0.23%:  for the sake of not
1.00%:  for the sake of not getting

0.27%:  for the sake of not being totally
0.46%:  for the sake of not being totally boring
0.23%:  the result
0.23%:  like a lot of computer science I learn
0.23%:  like all aspects of current
0.74%:  like all aspects of current society
0.23%:  is it cool enough to impress a girl
0.23%:  since most of our
0.32%:  since most of our society
0.23%:  like all computer science has been for pretty

0.34%:  it only applies to the number of a song or
0.23%:  be careful not to look me in the eyes in
0.23%:  like a lot of computer science feelings
0.22%:  for the sake of creating computer
0.22%:  some people are trying to use this fact
0.22%:  before you start seeing me
0.22%:  to get back to your earlier point of

0.22%:  please keep the number
0.22%:  before you call someone
0.22%:  before you get too lost in the legal

0.22%:  before you take this as

0.37%:  like so many things of interest to
0.22%:  looking at the problem
0.22%:  computer science has been going for only
0.22%:  since computer storage is entirely logical

0.22%:  before you embrace this notion
0.22%:  in the interest of keeping your respect of
0.22%:  to keep things simple for our legal
0.22%:  I think people are going to listen to your
0.22%:  before you go too far thinking it
0.22%:  is it cool enough to be my personal
0.22%:  computer science has been pretty big on
0.22%:  please keep this our little secret if
0.22%:  be careful not to tell someone this
0.22%:  some people are really boring
0.22%:  before you start telling people these
0.22%:  people are still going to sue me if I try
0.22%:  on account of my being so cool
0.22%:  since people are still using
0.22%:  getting back to my topic
0.22%:  in the interest of keeping your complete
0.22%:  the computer science bit is
0.22%:  computer science is not the only boring
0.22%:  before you go setting
0.22%:  like so many of our
1.21%:  like so many of our greatest
0.68%:  like so many of our greatest concepts
0.22%:  getting back to the issue of personal porn
0.22%:  I think people are missing out by not creating
0.22%:  in the process of talking about my science
0.22%:  people continue to ignore that
0.22%:  the computer science is still boring
0.22%:  since no computer is capable of going
0.22%:  for some reason I keep getting all
0.22%:  computer science is probably going to kill off the
0.22%:  is it cool enough to get myself
0.22%:  I prefer to think of it more as cool because
0.22%:  like all computer science there is no profit
0.22%:  before you start taking things for
0.22%:  not cool enough to go back in time!
0.22%:  be careful before sharing
0.22%:  because of this logical con
0.22%:  look!
0.22%:  before you go thinking I respect
0.22%:  once you get past the first
0.22%:  since someone
0.22%:  for some reason I keep getting pictures
0.22%:  for the purposes of my book
0.22%:  it may
0.22%:  be careful not to step on any of
0.22%:  please keep it to yourself! I got this far on
0.22%:  like a lot of great computer science ep
0.22%:  being a computer scientist by career
0.22%:  I still prefer to think of my
0.22%:  for the sake of simple
0.22%:  as the computer scientist!
0.22%:  the coolest part is looking up
0.22%:  because the problem is log
0.22%:  be careful before making
0.59%:  be careful before making copies
0.22%:  you better keep it secret
0.22%:  once you start looking at them
0.22%:  like most logical truth
0.22%:  be careful not to inform the police
0.22%:  if I tell people about my
0.59%:  if I tell people about my research
0.29%:  if I tell people about my theories
0.22%:  for some reason people still get bent
0.22%:  it comes at the price of all our
0.22%:  on account of being legally
0.22%:  keep it to yourself in case it becomes cool later
0.22%:  not enough to get me to
0.22%:  as I often tell
1.88%:  as I often tell people
0.22%:  keep it to yourself or else it becomes an
0.30%:  keep it to yourself or else it becomes an open
0.22%:  not really cool enough for me to repeat it!
0.22%:  it comes at the cost of breaking
0.22%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science l
0.22%:  before I go on talking about my theories on
0.22%:  I prefer to think of computer science as not being silly
0.22%:  computer science has been boring for like
0.22%:  like all other aspects of my science
0.22%:  keep it to yourself since there are
0.22%:  not cool enough to keep it
0.22%:  before you start printing illegal copies of the S
0.22%:  unlike a lot of other aspects of logic
0.22%:  being a computer scientist I keep things cool
0.22%:  is there
0.28%:  is there a computer

1.28%:  be careful in telling others of my secret
0.49%:  be careful in telling others of my secret!
0.22%:  not really cool enough to compare
0.22%:  the real point of computer science is only
0.22%:  it comes at the price of losing respect
0.30%:  it comes at the price of losing respect for all
0.22%:  is there really a computer science book in
0.22%:  I still like to see
0.22%:  computer science is only one step along
0.22%:  unlike most things people are saying
0.22%:  like all theories of computer science is
0.22%:  after looking into the topic
0.26%:  after looking into the topic myself
0.22%:  be careful not to tell others of
0.22%:  not really cool enough to bring back to
0.22%:  I prefer to think of it as one computer being
0.22%:  computer science is not going
0.42%:  computer science is not going to help
0.36%:  computer science is not going to be
0.22%:  I prefer to talk about the problem
0.22%:  like the rest of computer science it is really
0.22%:  it makes perfect logical sense for
0.22%:  the real point of computer science is I
0.22%:  before you go creating perfect
0.22%:  being computer science is totally
1.05%:  being computer science is totally boring
0.33%:  being computer science is totally boring!
0.22%:  please keep it our little secret from
0.22%:  please keep it secret until I can
0.22%:  back to the original computer point
0.22%:  it really sucks to be the
0.47%:  it really sucks to be the one
0.71%:  it really sucks to be the one person
0.45%:  it really sucks to be the one pointing
0.33%:  it really sucks to be the one person in
0.26%:  it really sucks to be the one bringing
0.22%:  as computer science is like the
0.22%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science being b
0.22%:  before you go planning to release
0.22%:  before I go back to my research into infinite
0.22%:  not really cool enough for me to keep a secret
0.22%:  once you get past the logic problems
0.22%:  probably not cool enough to let me keep a
0.22%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to look only on
0.22%:  before you start asking for the
0.22%:  it also makes things
0.22%:  before you start making copies of hit
0.22%:  on account of my being a scientist of
0.22%:  being a computer scientist playing
0.22%:  computer science has gotten really boring in
0.22%:  before you can listen to the song on
0.22%:  it occurs to me that I really
0.22%:  being a computer scientist I forget all
0.22%:  it only applies to numbers bigger than one! I
0.22%:  keep it to yourself in case things go
0.22%:  like all computer science footage
0.22%:  in the current
0.62%:  in the current economic
0.61%:  in the current legal
2.48%:  in the current legal climate
0.36%:  in the current legal regime
0.34%:  in the current climate
0.24%:  in the current climate of legal
0.22%:  most people only care about the cool effects
0.22%:  please keep this to yourself! I can get into big
0.22%:  people are still using it!
0.22%:  I still like the computer
2.04%:  I still like the computer science
0.70%:  I still like the computer science part
0.22%:  like all of computer sciences
0.22%:  being a computer scientist only gets cooler if I
0.22%:  computer science being a strongly
0.22%:  be careful not to mention this book
0.22%:  like all my other opinions
0.22%:  like other forms of legal
0.22%:  computer science is like this all
0.22%:  to be serious here for
0.22%:  like all the greatest pieces of poetry
0.22%:  if you like that
0.22%:  not cool enough to replace my present
0.22%:  like all the best computer science po
0.39%:  like all the best computer science pointers I
0.22%:  to get back to it
0.22%:  like all computer science I present to others
0.22%:  before you steal this song
0.30%:  before you steal this song from
0.22%:  I promise not to tell anyone the
0.22%:  computer science is also entirely boring too
0.22%:  the computer science angle is better
0.22%:  before I get too far into my theories on
0.22%:  like all theories of perfect reason
0.22%:  as the computer scientist looking for real
0.22%:  be careful not to become too fasc
0.22%:  before you start stealing things from people like
0.22%:  the best part of computer science is going in for
0.22%:  before you go breaking open all those enc
0.22%:  as computer science is not legally
0.22%:  the point of computer science is really to general
0.22%:  thanks to computer science being a religion
0.23%:  thanks to computer science being a religion of
0.22%:  for the purposes of leg
0.22%:  the computer science bit is really
0.35%:  the computer science bit is really boring
0.22%:  computer science is really boring so that
0.22%:  before you take this all
0.22%:  forget that
0.22%:  in the process of talking about it I become
0.22%:  the problem of creating
0.30%:  the problem of creating original
1.81%:  the problem of creating original content
0.42%:  the problem of creating original content is
0.22%:  like a lot of the
0.31%:  like a lot of the computer
8.91%:  like a lot of the computer sciences
1.16%:  like a lot of the computer science I learn
0.74%:  like a lot of the computer science stories
0.22%:  if you are looking for me
0.22%:  it only applies to me because I stole
0.22%:  before you go making copies of all the pir
0.22%:  like all other computer science fant
0.22%:  keep it to yourself! I might be able to release
0.22%:  to get back to the original purpose of my scene
0.22%:  before you begin to imagine
0.22%:  is it cool enough for me to get a license
0.22%:  computer science is nothing like poetry or
0.22%:  computer science is a lot of sitting alone
0.22%:  before you call the cops on me for posting
0.22%:  the computer science ge
0.22%:  since the computer itself can be broken
0.22%:  before you thank me for starting
0.22%:  I keep
0.94%:  I keep getting
0.74%:  I keep forget
0.58%:  I keep getting this
0.42%:  I keep telling
0.64%:  I keep telling myself that if
0.62%:  I keep telling myself that it
0.43%:  I keep telling myself it
0.41%:  I keep getting this really
0.40%:  I keep getting these
0.36%:  I keep getting the

0.25%:  I keep getting this terrible
0.24%:  I keep getting really
0.23%:  I keep saying
0.34%:  I keep saying it because
0.22%:  it only applies to the number being
0.22%:  I guess there are people
0.22%:  like a lot of great computer science in theory
0.22%:  computer science is not the only area of life like
0.22%:  if computer science tells
0.22%:  if computer science is like that
0.22%:  like all the best computer science so
0.26%:  like all the best computer science so often
0.22%:  like a lot of cool computer sc
0.22%:  in the interest of not boring you or
0.22%:  I prefer to think of it as one big
0.93%:  I prefer to think of it as one big computer
8.33%:  I prefer to think of it as one big computer science
0.33%:  I prefer to think of it as one big argument
0.27%:  I prefer to think of it as one big computer science n
0.26%:  I prefer to think of it as one big computer science ge
0.22%:  this computer science angle is really
0.22%:  computer science has been looking for better legal
0.24%:  computer science has been looking for better legal options
0.22%:  keep it a secret from other
0.22%:  forget about the song
0.22%:  in the interest of not becoming a par
0.22%:  before you start hiring
0.22%:  before you start thinking someone else
0.22%:  after looking into it closely
0.22%:  back to the original topic of
1.22%:  back to the original topic of computer
0.34%:  back to the original topic of porn
0.22%:  I prefer to think about it before sleeping
0.22%:  before you start looking for the meaning
0.22%:  before you go asking me for the latest
0.22%:  like all computer science pretty
0.22%:  be careful not to make copies of things online
0.22%:  is it cool enough to call
0.22%:  it brings up the
0.32%:  it brings up the problem
0.68%:  it brings up the problem of original
0.32%:  it brings up the problem of creating
0.25%:  it brings up the problem of original content
0.22%:  like a lot of things computer science is a
0.22%:  if you promise not to tell the police I
0.22%:  it only applies to one series
0.22%:  like all proof
0.22%:  as the computer scientist I clearly
0.22%:  assuming
0.22%:  to really get the point
0.22%:  computer science is pretty intense
0.22%:  unlike some other science people
0.22%:  before you begin thinking
0.22%:  it occurs to me that if one person
0.22%:  computer science is a pretty hot
0.22%:  before you go telling people this on
0.22%:  most people are too busy feeling
0.22%:  before I become the first scientist
0.22%:  I promise to stop talking science before
0.22%:  like any great computer scientist before
0.22%:  please keep that to yourself since
0.22%:  not cool enough to create
0.22%:  you can also store entire
0.22%:  not cool enough to keep interest
0.22%:  like all things in computer science I get
0.22%:  the point of computer science is self
0.22%:  before you think of me
0.22%:  before you start pl
0.22%:  since the computer is a logical tool
0.22%:  not as cool as the time
0.22%:  I guess it only affects
0.73%:  I guess it only affects people
0.42%:  I guess it only affects people like
0.22%:  like all computer science party
0.22%:  to get back to the original concern of
0.22%:  most people are too busy looking at their nice
0.22%:  be careful not to copy it please
0.22%:  as a computer scientist I feel like the
0.31%:  as a computer scientist I feel like the cool
0.22%:  before you start backing
0.22%:  please keep it to yourself or I might lose ten
0.22%:  be careful not to inform the people
0.22%:  before you make illegal copies of the internet
0.22%:  be careful not to breathe on me or
0.22%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer that
0.22%:  keep it to yourself in case I lose control
0.22%:  computer science is all I
0.22%:  I think computer science in
3.27%:  I think computer science in general is really
0.74%:  I think computer science in general is totally
0.49%:  I think computer science in general is probably
0.33%:  I think computer science in general is too
0.22%:  before you go back in time telling people these
0.87%:  before you go back in time telling people these facts
0.22%:  to get back to my original purpose for
0.22%:  it comes at the price of being unable to copy songs like I

0.22%:  computer science is honestly not
0.22%:  in the interest of keeping my public

0.22%:  computer science IS really the
0.22%:  the coolest part is keeping your
0.22%:  computer science is still like the
0.22%:  before you go praising science for its complete
0.22%:  is it cool enough to replace being
0.22%:  in the interest of keeping you all on
0.22%:  being a computer scientist on top of being a rock
0.22%:  if I tell anyone else this
0.22%:  is it really cool enough to become a rock

0.22%:  unlike most of the content of

0.22%:  it only takes one person to change
0.22%:  it also means I get to keep using
0.22%:  before you go on praising me for this little n
0.22%:  as computer science is probably not
0.93%:  as computer science is probably not going
0.22%:  there are lots of computer science points
0.22%:  since most people actually
0.21%:  before you go claiming all the best internet
0.89%:  before you go claiming all the best internet porn
0.21%:  like all stories of computer science are
0.21%:  I promise not to steal your song
0.21%:  since most people only use

0.36%:  by the same

0.21%:  be careful not to look at my screen too
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can be right
0.21%:  computer science has been going on for a little bit
0.21%:  because of the economic press
0.21%:  back to the issue at
0.21%:  please keep it amongst
1.31%:  please keep it amongst yourself
0.49%:  please keep it amongst yourself!
0.21%:  before you get too critical of me
0.21%:  computer science is really boring too! I hope
0.21%:  back to the present
0.21%:  computer science is lots
1.95%:  computer science is lots of other
0.91%:  computer science is lots of other really
0.43%:  computer science is lots of really
0.64%:  computer science is lots of really boring
0.29%:  computer science is lots of other really neat
0.24%:  computer science is lots of other neat
0.21%:  I still prefer computer science to seeing
0.21%:  before you go making all those
0.33%:  before you go making all those copies
0.21%:  since no computer has infinite

0.21%:  since most people are too busy thinking of
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect those
0.21%:  on the computer science tip
0.21%:  it brings up some pretty
0.21%:  in the long
0.23%:  in the long term
0.21%:  be careful before asking me to tell
0.21%:  since most people actually think
0.21%:  oh no
0.21%:  the point of computer science is really to lose
0.21%:  if I tell people about this before
0.21%:  be careful not to inform people
0.21%:  the only reason computer science is log
0.21%:  not cool enough to replace my entire
0.29%:  not cool enough to replace my entire life
0.21%:  there are people trying

0.21%:  to the
0.68%:  to the computer
0.87%:  to the computer science
0.21%:  the more you listen
0.21%:  not cool enough to inspire a better
0.21%:  unlike many other science fiction plot
0.21%:  before you start making copies right
0.21%:  like all computer science is pretty boring I
0.21%:  being a computer scientist free

0.21%:  I prefer to talk about my feelings or
0.21%:  I think people are going to continue to say
0.21%:  people are still getting into
0.21%:  computer science is really a lot of going
0.21%:  I think computer science is probably going to offer
0.21%:  before you call the police on me for getting into
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it simply as a
0.21%:  the best part of being a computer science isn
0.21%:  I think computer science really belongs to a
0.21%:  is it cool enough to keep telling
0.21%:  is it cool enough to make people forget I recently
0.21%:  before I can continue telling
0.21%:  be careful not to look at the ceiling
0.21%:  like a lot of other computer science in general
0.21%:  computer science being as totally
0.21%:  some people get
0.91%:  some people get really
0.27%:  some people get angry
0.48%:  some people get angry about
0.49%:  some people get angry about this
0.39%:  some people get angry about it!
0.21%:  like any other computer science engineer
0.21%:  the computer scientist can go
0.21%:  computer science is totally not boring!
0.21%:  unlike certain other forms of logical
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I imagine the legal
0.21%:  the solution is to embrace
0.21%:  the computer science is totally bog
0.21%:  as a computer scientist of noble
0.21%:  the reason I like computer science is pretty
0.21%:  are you going to stop
0.21%:  as computer science is nothing if not pr
0.21%:  before you call the police on me for being secret
0.21%:  to keep things simple for yourself
0.21%:  there IS one possible solution to my
0.21%:  I think it only applies to me!
0.21%:  like most people born before the first
0.21%:  since no computer can store all these
0.21%:  after looking into the legal
0.21%:  it only gets cooler because the problem
0.21%:  before you make copies of the porn
0.21%:  unlike certain other forms of in
0.21%:  if computer science really is like
0.21%:  before you start telling people it
0.21%:  like all things computer science for non
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping you from acc
0.21%:  computer science is not only for ner
0.21%:  unlike the songs of
0.21%:  not cool enough to stop me pir
0.21%:  please try to keep these
0.21%:  before you make copies of this song or
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being legally un
0.21%:  for the sake of all our
0.21%:  computer science has been going on for literal
0.21%:  it might be cooler still
0.22%:  it might be cooler still if you
0.21%:  if you look at the facts
0.21%:  like any other cool concept
0.21%:  most people are content to ignore legal
0.21%:  in computer science the
0.21%:  as a computer scientist looking for logic
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping all my cool points
0.64%:  in the interest of keeping all my cool points for
0.21%:  being a computer scientist I think of
0.21%:  I guess the problem really
0.21%:  I really think computer science is so
0.21%:  please try not to think
0.21%:  please try not to think of
0.21%:  because of the infinite possible
0.21%:  can you imagine being so
0.21%:  be careful not to breathe it
0.21%:  not really cool enough to be speaking
0.21%:  unlike some other cool concepts I
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to charge
0.21%:  if computer science really takes
0.21%:  the computer science part only took
0.21%:  for the purposes of talking to girls
0.21%:  come closer
0.21%:  like many other concepts of
0.24%:  like many other concepts of interest
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I became
0.21%:  since most people are ignorant of the in
0.21%:  I still prefer computer science to be honestly
0.21%:  for the purposes of making it
0.21%:  it only applies to number bases
0.29%:  it only applies to number bases of
0.21%:  the computer scientist role is one
0.24%:  the computer scientist role is one of
0.21%:  I guess if someone
0.21%:  before you get too critical of the
0.21%:  before you start selling people their
0.21%:  being a computer scientist I prefer telling
0.21%:  you can still make copies of the song in
0.21%:  before you get all piss
0.21%:  being a computer scientist is often really cool! I
0.21%:  the computer science angle is not really
0.21%:  the more you learn
0.21%:  it sucks that people
0.21%:  I think my greatest
0.21%:  please try to ignore the porn
0.21%:  the computer science is only getting
0.21%:  like all computer science at the front
0.21%:  before you go into that
0.21%:  not really cool enough to be a proper science
0.21%:  unlike most other aspects of cool
0.21%:  in response to my article
0.21%:  to return to my original self
0.21%:  most people are boring
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping my personal legal

0.49%:  it gets me into trouble!
0.21%:  be careful before telling this to someone!
0.21%:  before anyone gets too critical of

0.21%:  as the computer scientist I look
0.21%:  the only reason computer science is keeping
0.21%:  before you start printing the

0.21%:  people are still going to continue to be
0.21%:  if you happen to notice
0.21%:  in the interest of being proper

3.74%:  being a computer scientist only for the sake of being cool
0.21%:  is it really cool enough to generate

0.21%:  back to my original purpose
0.21%:  is it really cool enough to go back to
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself or else I get in
0.21%:  computer science is still a lot of boring proof
0.21%:  computer science is totally a boring
0.21%:  like other aspects of computer liter
0.21%:  because of all the economic benefits people
0.21%:  like many of the sciences
0.21%:  computer science is totally great!
0.21%:  unlike some other topics of interest for

0.21%:  at present
0.21%:  the best part of computer science is feeling like an
0.21%:  I guess the point
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping our romantic
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can get a million
0.21%:  like so much great

0.21%:  I forgot to mention one critical
0.21%:  before you get too into the legal ram
0.21%:  being a computer scientist is no cake
0.21%:  like so many other pieces of cutting
0.21%:  it occurs to me that in
0.21%:  like all things computer science is better
0.21%:  before you start telling people I think
0.21%:  on account of it being illegal to copy them
0.21%:  the computer scientist is oblig

0.39%:  computer science is like a lot of things!
0.32%:  computer science is like a lot of things I
0.21%:  since the only people arguing

0.21%:  if you feel like getting some
0.43%:  if you feel like getting some porn
0.21%:  be careful not to leak it
0.21%:  I prefer to keep this secret because

0.21%:  because of these problems of
0.21%:  before you start pointing to
0.21%:  the computer science angle is so
0.21%:  at the risk of being totally creep
0.21%:  computer science is also really boring! I got
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself so that I become
0.21%:  being a computer scientist is cooler than
0.21%:  keep it to yourself for the present!

0.21%:  in the interest of keeping all of computer
0.59%:  in the interest of keeping all of computer science a
0.22%:  in the interest of keeping all of computer science as
0.21%:  it gets me thinking!
0.21%:  before you go telling people at the

0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science as being log
0.21%:  not really cool enough to bring into
0.31%:  not really cool enough to bring into practice
0.21%:  for the sake of computer sciences
0.21%:  to really get into computer science as
0.21%:  please keep the number secret
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science in only

0.21%:  not cool enough for me to risk
0.28%:  not cool enough for me to risk being
0.21%:  please promise not to tell anyone! I figure
0.21%:  since the computer is able to generate

0.21%:  before you go thinking I can be
0.21%:  if you listen to the same
0.44%:  if you listen to the same song on
0.21%:  is it really cooler than computer

0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to become one
0.21%:  like all things in computer science or poetry
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I hope to one
0.21%:  since no computer is large
0.21%:  like most cases
1.43%:  like most cases of logical
0.29%:  like most cases of logic
0.22%:  like most cases of legal
0.21%:  you can still go to prison for being mean
0.23%:  you can still go to prison for being mean to the
0.21%:  like most real life stories
0.21%:  is it cool enough for me to be an
0.21%:  in the spirit of self
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as science being really cool on
0.21%:  it only applies to numbers greater then
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I am not going to be
0.21%:  like all the best computer science tang
0.21%:  not cool enough for me to still be typing
0.21%:  like all the best computer science person
0.21%:  like most logical theories
0.21%:  I promise to stop talking before anyone else
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I feel more
0.21%:  like many of the greatest pieces
0.23%:  like many of the greatest pieces of science
0.21%:  computer science is honestly one
0.21%:  like many of the concepts of
0.21%:  computer science is really one of the boring
0.21%:  the point of computer science is really to feel
0.21%:  like most cool stuff I learn
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being super annoying!
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science as selling
0.21%:  before you start lifting songs
0.21%:  not enough people care!
0.21%:  in the interest of not becoming a figure
0.21%:  like all the computer science stories before
0.21%:  the computer science analogy is broken too
0.21%:  before you go telling people at the bar
0.21%:  like most things are cool
0.21%:  since the computer is really great
0.21%:  there are still some people using
0.21%:  I suspect that
0.21%:  computer science is probably not going to kill
0.21%:  since no computer is inf
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich selling a
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping all my secrets
0.21%:  since the computer stores it all in one place
0.21%:  being the computer science pro
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as science telling us more
0.21%:  probably not cool enough to take me
0.21%:  as a computer scientist looking only for logic
0.21%:  like all computer science is either
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science as silly
0.21%:  before you go into the street
0.21%:  computer science is a lot of boring other
0.21%:  back to the serious problem of pir
0.21%:  is it really cool enough for me to eat
0.21%:  if you listen to me talk for another
0.21%:  before you start asking me for the
0.21%:  I prefer to talk about my opinions on the
0.21%:  it only applies to numbers like song
0.21%:  the point of computer science is to break free
0.21%:  like a lot of computer science at first
0.21%:  some people like their songs
0.21%:  computer science is probably not going to free
0.21%:  keep it secret from anyone
0.21%:  the only reason computer science folks
0.21%:  not really cool enough for some
0.21%:  before you become too thr
0.21%:  before anyone goes telling people this
0.21%:  probably not cool enough to release me
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science gone S
0.21%:  before you go calling the press
0.21%:  in the interest of being a proper
0.21%:  being a computer scientist IS being
0.98%:  being a computer scientist IS being cool
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping our stories
0.21%:  before you go thinking it means pir
0.21%:  since most people are not thinking about logic
0.21%:  if the computer scientist keeps going
0.21%:  thinking about it a
0.46%:  thinking about it a bit more closely
0.24%:  thinking about it a bit longer
0.21%:  it only applies to numbers like those
0.21%:  the best part is you can look
0.21%:  not really cool enough to become a scientist I
0.21%:  computer science is also really boring too! I often
0.29%:  computer science is also really boring too! I often get
0.21%:  not cool enough to replace my interest in self
0.21%:  things
0.88%:  things get really
0.60%:  things get really cool
0.26%:  things get really cool once
0.21%:  unlike other aspects of politics
0.21%:  before you go claiming that one person
0.21%:  mostly because I
0.21%:  it still means people
0.21%:  the real point is computer
0.52%:  the real point is computer science offers
0.51%:  the real point is computer science is really
0.48%:  the real point is computer science!
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science only being log
0.21%:  unlike most things I notice
0.21%:  unlike the coolness of science
0.21%:  it only applies to me because I control the
0.21%:  is it cool enough to let me keep saying
0.21%:  it might also be true for
0.21%:  is it really cool enough for me to practice being
0.21%:  not cool enough to force
0.21%:  if you look at it in the correct
0.21%:  for the sake of personal computer
0.28%:  for the sake of personal computer science
0.21%:  most people agree it
0.21%:  is it really cool enough for me to create
0.21%:  like so many things in our life
0.21%:  the real benefit of computer science is not only
0.21%:  it is probably not going
0.27%:  it is probably not going to make
0.21%:  like the ultimate
0.21%:  like most cool things I say about
0.21%:  please try not to repeat
0.21%:  it only makes sense if there
0.21%:  be careful talking to other people before I get
0.21%:  in the interest of making you feel cool
0.21%:  lucky
0.21%:  like most other cool stuff in
0.33%:  like most other cool stuff in science
0.21%:  keep it to yourself please! I got the
0.21%:  like a lot of computer science so
0.21%:  computer science is totally for
0.21%:  not really cool enough for me to keep being a fr
0.21%:  it only applies to numbers of finite length! I
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself so nothing terrible
0.21%:  be careful not to repeat it or someone
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I feel this
0.21%:  to get back to the original problem of our
0.21%:  before you get all sm
0.21%:  before you go telling people it means
0.26%:  before you go telling people it means that
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being able to see your porn
0.21%:  before you go making copies of it
0.21%:  like all the best sciences
0.21%:  it becomes really boring if I keep
0.21%:  science
0.44%:  science fiction
0.21%:  like all the best secrets of
0.21%:  the point of computer science is being able to general
0.21%:  keep it to yourself in case the cops get
0.21%:  the coolest part for
0.47%:  the coolest part for me is being

0.21%:  it comes at the price of our society being log
0.21%:  before you go asking for a piece
0.21%:  please keep it our little secret! I mean
0.21%:  is it cool enough to replace my life
0.21%:  before you start changing people
0.21%:  unlike some other aspects of binary logic
0.21%:  is it cool enough to listen to me pr
0.21%:  before you take it to heart
0.21%:  the computer science angle gets
0.21%:  unlike the rest of my opinions on
0.21%:  like many other pieces of legal fiction
0.21%:  is it cool enough to compare
0.21%:  keep it secret from the public
0.21%:  since computer storage is really nothing
0.21%:  being a computer scientist is a cool
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect the earnings
0.89%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect the earnings from being
0.21%:  like all things computer science! it
0.21%:  before you start placing
0.21%:  unlike the rest of my personal opinions
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to become a secret
0.21%:  computer science is really one of the least boring
0.21%:  like a lot of theories in
2.49%:  like a lot of theories in computer science I
1.86%:  like a lot of theories in computer sciences
0.72%:  like a lot of theories in computer science or
0.65%:  like a lot of theories in computer science I probably
0.50%:  like a lot of theories in computer science I probably got

0.29%:  before you listen to me talk science fiction
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming one of the earliest
0.21%:  some people are trying to use it
0.21%:  because most people think binary is cool
0.21%:  it might be possible
0.21%:  neither of us are going to be able to tell my
0.21%:  computer science is far better
0.21%:  since most people only think of
0.21%:  let us not speak of my feelings
0.21%:  people are still going to sue others for inf
0.21%:  back to the problem of creating

1.54%:  after looking into the topic more closely
0.21%:  I prefer to listen to music the
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping my personal blog free
0.21%:  it comes at the price of losing one of society
0.21%:  I prefer to call myself the
0.21%:  unlike most things legal
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I come
0.21%:  the computer science analogy of
0.21%:  the computer scientist is feeling
0.21%:  before you praise me for pointing these logical
0.21%:  there is one possible outcome of
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as cool in a computer sense
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science being s
0.21%:  the greatest irony of computer science is looking
0.21%:  like any computer science thing I tell
0.21%:  before I get back to playing computer chess online
0.21%:  in the interest of economic security for
0.21%:  computer science being the tool
0.53%:  computer science being the tool of progress
0.21%:  computer science being the tool of progress it
0.21%:  like they
0.21%:  unlike a lot of things people say to be
0.21%:  I still prefer computer science itself
0.21%:  once you get past the logic of
0.33%:  once you get past the logic of it all
0.21%:  as a computer science I
0.21%:  as computer science is being
0.21%:  before you go claiming all the secrets
0.21%:  please try not to look
0.21%:  my greatest concern is people
0.21%:  computer science IS really like this
0.21%:  not really because people
0.21%:  before you listen to another boring science
0.25%:  before you listen to another boring science talk
0.21%:  keep it to yourself that
0.21%:  before you go stealing the contents of people
0.21%:  of course there are some
0.21%:  computer science has been bringing
0.21%:  computer science also offers the ability
0.21%:  not cool enough to keep my secret
0.21%:  before you listen to me speak
0.21%:  in the spirit of computer science!
0.21%:  computer science has been talking
0.21%:  because of this logical property of

0.60%:  being a computer scientist IS a cool
1.73%:  being a computer scientist IS a cool thing
0.55%:  being a computer scientist IS a cool thing!
0.26%:  being a computer scientist IS a lonely
0.31%:  being a computer scientist IS a lonely life
0.21%:  once you start getting
0.21%:  not really cool enough to be mistaken for science!
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a tool only
0.21%:  not really cool enough for me to resist sticking
0.21%:  since most people are unf
0.21%:  before you make too
0.21%:  unlike most of the people on
0.21%:  computer science is probably the first
0.21%:  are you still
0.34%:  are you still thinking
0.34%:  are you still thinking of becoming
0.21%:  unlike many other concepts in logic
0.21%:  being a computer scientist can be lonely! I
0.21%:  it really sucks for the people creating
0.21%:  to get back to the original focus
0.21%:  I bet
0.24%:  I bet you can
0.21%:  can you think of some
0.21%:  is it cool enough to be my career
0.21%:  you can still make copies of those

0.21%:  I feel that
0.21%:  computer science has been pretty great
0.21%:  before you thank me for being all
0.21%:  before you take this concept too
0.21%:  as computer science is often really
1.17%:  as computer science is often really boring
0.21%:  is it really possible to compute
0.21%:  is it cool enough to inspire me to be
0.21%:  not really cool enough for most
0.21%:  for some reason I still like to be
0.21%:  it occurs to me there are
0.21%:  since the computer itself is log
0.21%:  before you listen to that song in
0.21%:  the coolest part is being able to go
0.21%:  the really cool stuff is going

0.72%:  computer science is a lot of neat things like
0.21%:  in the process of looking at computer storage
0.21%:  if computer science fails
0.21%:  for some reason people are still fighting to
0.21%:  be careful not to say it in
0.21%:  speaking of that
0.21%:  before I get too into things
0.21%:  is it cool enough to really make
0.21%:  like any other computer science lesson for
0.21%:  on account of it being totally cool
0.21%:  is it really possible for a computer to S
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science as not being a big
0.21%:  like the rest of computer science is often boring
0.21%:  like so many of our legal

0.21%:  before you go creating some
0.21%:  not really cool enough for me to accept it in
0.21%:  this is computer science not
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself as it might be
0.21%:  not enough people seem to get
0.21%:  computer science is totally freak
0.21%:  being a computer scientist IS boring!
0.21%:  like many parts
0.47%:  like many parts of science
0.38%:  like many parts of the
0.24%:  like many parts of life
0.21%:  is it cool enough to let me take
0.21%:  it comes at the price of opening yourself to
0.21%:  because of these in
0.21%:  unlike other forms of religion
0.21%:  I promise not to tell anyone else because it
0.21%:  the computer scientist is only looking
0.21%:  before you get too far into the legal
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can get some of
0.21%:  in the process of trying to make sure
0.21%:  be careful not to look into the eyes
0.21%:  computer science is also not entirely
0.21%:  as computer science is the one
0.21%:  some people say there are
0.21%:  like all things in comp
0.21%:  be careful not to make copies of the porn
0.21%:  the real cool stuff
0.21%:  can you imagine being the first person to feel
1.16%:  can you imagine being the first person to feel cool
0.21%:  like all computer science proff
0.21%:  is it cool enough to make people less
0.21%:  the computer science is probably a
0.47%:  the computer science is probably a little off
0.21%:  it brings up some really big
0.21%:  like all computer science anything
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as one giant
0.21%:  for the purposes of romantic
0.21%:  for the purposes of creating some

0.21%:  please keep it a secret from the non
0.21%:  before you go back in time to tell people this so
0.21%:  like a lot of great computer science presents
0.21%:  is it cool enough for me to collect
0.21%:  being a computer scientist of logical bent
0.21%:  computer science IS really boring if
0.21%:  computer science also offers hope
0.21%:  like most of the stories
0.21%:  if you can get
0.21%:  you can still respect
0.66%:  you can still respect someone
0.21%:  before you listen to a single note of the
0.21%:  is it cool enough to get me free
0.51%:  is it cool enough to get me free porn
0.21%:  if computer science is anything to
0.25%:  if computer science is anything to go on
0.21%:  before you start telling people in
0.21%:  since the computer is a perfect being
0.21%:  before I continue my thesis on
0.21%:  unlike many other cool concepts I
0.21%:  computer science is sort of like that in
3.16%:  computer science is sort of like that in general
0.87%:  computer science is sort of like that in general!
0.21%:  like all computer science theories born
0.21%:  the computer science is really too
0.21%:  before you start planning to become rich selling
0.65%:  before you start planning to become rich selling copies
0.21%:  before I get too far into the problem
0.21%:  for some reason people still buy into the
0.21%:  it also seems
0.41%:  it also seems like
0.57%:  it also seems like a pretty
0.25%:  it also seems unlikely
0.21%:  be careful not to steal the

0.28%:  in the process of creating a perfect
0.21%:  before you print this article
0.21%:  speaking of song titles
0.21%:  since most people are too busy getting
0.21%:  before I go on talking about these concepts
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself for the time being! I also
0.21%:  the really cool part is seeing it
0.21%:  it only applies to numbers longer then
0.21%:  before you email that
0.49%:  before you email that song
0.21%:  computer science is like that for lots
0.21%:  computer science is also one of the great
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool because some
0.21%:  at the risk of getting all serious on
0.21%:  if you look past
1.61%:  if you look past the legal
0.37%:  if you look past the logical
0.32%:  if you look past the legal concerns

0.21%:  before you go too far in thinking it
0.21%:  computer science being one of the least original
0.21%:  it occurs to me that once
0.21%:  because of the millions of bits
0.21%:  computer science is better than all
0.21%:  if you listen to the song too
0.21%:  the real point of computer science is to ask
0.21%:  be careful not to tell my research
0.21%:  before you go praising me for science
0.21%:  some people are still going to be
0.21%:  to get back to my real
0.21%:  I prefer to think of computer science as illegal
0.21%:  be careful not to tell anyone or I promise
0.21%:  like porn
0.21%:  before you go praising me for this content
0.21%:  is it cool enough to make people neglect
0.21%:  as computer science begins to take on
0.21%:  the computer science folks aren
0.21%:  unlike most other cool concepts in
0.21%:  the coolest part is being able to come
0.21%:  neither you nor I are going to be able to complete
0.21%:  before you start printing illegal copies of the b
0.21%:  thanks to computer science being so inter
0.21%:  you can still go to prison for it
0.21%:  people continue to think
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping it
1.01%:  in the interest of keeping it cool
0.21%:  in the interest of ensuring
0.35%:  in the interest of ensuring complete
0.41%:  in the interest of ensuring complete logical
0.60%:  in the interest of ensuring complete logical co
0.21%:  in the interest of keeping my persona
0.21%:  computer science is terrible!
0.21%:  like all great truths in
0.38%:  like all great truths in science
0.21%:  before you start making copies of these billion
0.21%:  before you go thinking it applies to all sorts
0.21%:  I keep telling you this
0.21%:  before you start breaking into phone
0.21%:  the point of computer science IS to break
0.21%:  it gets boring
0.37%:  it gets boring after a couple
0.40%:  it gets boring after a couple of months
0.21%:  it gets boring after about
0.21%:  computer science being the great liberal
0.21%:  like all stories of computer science gone hay
0.21%:  if computer science is totally broken
0.21%:  please keep this little
0.21%:  the real benefit of computer science is really
0.21%:  for the sake of computer storage
0.21%:  forget about that!
0.21%:  to get back to my first
0.21%:  for the purposes of looking
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science gone bon
0.21%:  before you go on telling people that certain
0.21%:  before you go praising me on the content
0.21%:  before things get really out
5.61%:  before things get really out of control
0.21%:  in the process of making it cool I forgot
0.21%:  there are still some folks out
0.21%:  is it really cool enough for me to re
0.21%:  there is one computer science story
0.21%:  if you listen to the song before telling someone
0.21%:  is it cool enough to forget my
0.21%:  like all things of science
0.21%:  computer science is also pretty hot!
0.21%:  not really cool for
0.40%:  not really cool for computer
0.21%:  computer science is totally fr
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being unable to keep songs in
0.21%:  keep it to yourself or I might go
0.38%:  keep it to yourself or I might go to prison
0.21%:  unlike some other science fiction property
0.21%:  being a computer scientist in the 
0.21%:  like any other computer science blog posting
0.21%:  I think computer science is all
0.21%:  in the interest of stopping before I lose my
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself! I seem
0.28%:  please keep it to yourself! I seem to be
0.21%:  the coolest part for me is seeing
0.21%:  I think computer science really gets boring
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being able to sue for
0.21%:  like all aspects of my science
0.21%:  as a computer scientist of only
0.21%:  for those of you looking
0.21%:  computer science is often a little
0.47%:  computer science is often a little boring
0.24%:  computer science is often a little like
0.21%:  before you go back to school claiming
0.21%:  it comes at the price of being unable to sell one song
0.33%:  it comes at the price of being unable to sell one song for
0.21%:  not really cool enough to escape
0.77%:  not really cool enough to escape being
0.21%:  the point of computer science is not seeing
0.21%:  the only solution is for me to create
0.21%:  before you go making phot
0.21%:  you can still be fin
0.21%:  keep it to yourself so I can get more points for being a
0.21%:  be careful not to copy this entire
0.21%:  before I go any further in
0.21%:  it comes at the price of one person being unable
0.21%:  I prefer to think about science fiction more
0.21%:  for some reason people still get tick
0.21%:  unlike a lot of other science people
0.21%:  because the problem is only
0.21%:  like all computer science is too boring for anyone
0.21%:  people forget
0.21%:  computer science is only a little bit of
0.21%:  computer science has gotten really boring of
0.21%:  being a computer scientist I only speak
0.25%:  being a computer scientist I only speak of
0.21%:  people continue to ignore it!
0.21%:  being a computer scientist for society
0.21%:  being a computer scientist is not all I
0.21%:  if you promise to keep it a secret I
1.11%:  if you promise to keep it a secret I can tell
0.21%:  before you start talking to me in
0.21%:  being a computer scientist I prefer long
0.21%:  not cool enough to let me escape
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer the legal
0.21%:  before you start looking to me for all
0.21%:  it comes at the price of one single
0.21%:  unlike most other science people
0.21%:  the point of computer science is to raise
0.21%:  I prefer to talk about the problems of science
0.21%:  in spite
0.38%:  in spite of this problem
0.31%:  in spite of that
0.30%:  in spite of all
0.26%:  in spite of my
0.28%:  in spite of my best
0.21%:  before you listen to that one
0.21%:  for some reason I keep getting in trouble all
0.21%:  please keep it to yourself in case I get the
0.21%:  computer science is really neat too so
0.21%:  being a computer science pione
0.21%:  I prefer to imagine the
0.21%:  the point of computer science is not in legal
0.21%:  back to the number
0.21%:  being a computer scientist I can only report
0.21%:  before you go back to telling lies
0.21%:  computer science is not entirely point
0.21%:  for the sake of our entire legal
0.21%:  since most people are unable to see logic
0.21%:  before you start making copies online
0.21%:  like all great computer science stories of y
0.21%:  as a computer scientist I feel like the only
0.21%:  like most things in pure
0.71%:  like most things in pure logic
0.21%:  it makes perfect sense once you notice
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as cool science more
0.21%:  the best part of being a computer science is looking on
0.21%:  as computer science is probably the one
0.21%:  please keep it secret because it
0.21%:  be careful not to become inf
0.21%:  is it cool enough to keep from being stolen by a
0.21%:  the coolest part is being able to go online
0.21%:  computer science is also pretty great! I
0.21%:  it only applies to me because I chose
0.21%:  it really sucks to be the person
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as a problem to be S
0.21%:  before you go claiming all the free porn on
0.21%:  there are still plenty of computer science books!
0.21%:  for some reason I keep getting into these really
0.21%:  as a computer scientist I prefer being cool to being on
0.21%:  the reason I mention it is because
0.21%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to become rich once
0.21%:  because someone
0.21%:  it comes at the price of an
0.25%:  it comes at the price of an entire
0.21%:  you can still go to prison for 
0.21%:  not really cool enough for me to keep printing
0.21%:  before you pat me on the back for posting
0.21%:  can you imagine the cost
0.60%:  can you imagine the cost of printing
0.43%:  can you imagine the cost of keeping
0.21%:  can you imagine the cost of register
0.21%:  like most pieces of cool theory

0.21%:  you can also store entire books

0.20%:  before you start selling copies of me
0.20%:  I prefer to keep this fact
0.20%:  the point of computer science is going
0.20%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich selling pat
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it merely as being cool!
0.20%:  be careful speaking in
0.20%:  I guess there are more
0.20%:  like most theories of eternal
0.47%:  like most theories of eternal conflict
0.20%:  since there are so many people looking to get
0.20%:  the only problem is if

0.20%:  like other computer science tools
0.20%:  some people are trying to get the

0.20%:  like all great computer science they
0.20%:  before you start looking online for the best
0.20%:  if you happen to see me later
0.20%:  there are plenty more cool
0.20%:  in the process of trying to make perfect

0.64%:  like a lot of computer science it gets boring
0.28%:  like a lot of computer science it gets boring real
0.20%:  being a computer scientist changes
0.20%:  before you start thinking of opening a pir
0.20%:  like most cool things once you start
0.20%:  is it cool enough to get someone
0.20%:  in the interest of full economic
0.20%:  be careful not to steal my cool
0.20%:  the point of computer science is not really being log
0.20%:  this computer science talk is going to be really
0.20%:  it has
0.20%:  because it is so
0.20%:  getting back to your personal
0.57%:  getting back to your personal life
0.20%:  as the computer scientist looking for porn
0.20%:  unlike most other real
0.20%:  for the sake of computer science it
0.20%:  keep it to yourself so I can still be
0.20%:  in the interest of keeping you safe
0.20%:  being a computer scientist I prefer books
0.20%:  as computer science is one of life
0.20%:  in the process of learning about logic
0.20%:  there are still computer science books
0.28%:  there are still computer science books being
0.20%:  computer science is probably the greatest feeling

0.20%:  speaking of cool computer facts
0.20%:  before you think of creating
0.20%:  before you start lifting someone
0.20%:  like all aspects of the computer engineer
0.20%:  is it really possible for me
0.27%:  is it really possible for me to be
0.20%:  I prefer to talk about it in person!
0.20%:  in the absence of perfect legal
0.20%:  it only affects me because I like both
0.20%:  probably not cool enough to make life

0.31%:  let us not speak of it before the general
0.27%:  let us not speak of it before others

0.20%:  be careful not to step on this
0.20%:  before you go praising me for this latest
0.20%:  keep it to yourself! I plan to file
0.20%:  not cool enough for me to resist breaking
0.20%:  because of the problem of in
0.20%:  it only applies to inf
0.20%:  of course there are still people
0.20%:  before you go making copies of all this porn
0.20%:  computer science is often pretty boring!
0.20%:  at the risk of being totally un
0.20%:  let me be frank
0.20%:  like all computer science posters
0.20%:  as you can tell from looking
0.20%:  like a lot of things in computer science I also
0.20%:  being a computer scientist I get really
0.20%:  I think computer science is probably getting a
0.20%:  before anyone tries to suggest I
0.20%:  computer science being one of those boring
0.20%:  this is computer science I
0.20%:  it comes at the price of losing one of our legal
0.20%:  back to the original purpose of my letter
0.20%:  it remains to be seen if people can
0.20%:  all computer science is like this! I
0.20%:  like all other computer science notions of
0.20%:  the reason I became
0.20%:  the coolest part of it is
0.20%:  I guess the problem is really
0.20%:  there is no computer science book
0.20%:  computer science is not that boring!
0.20%:  in case I
0.20%:  it also seems like a pretty boring
0.20%:  before you look it
0.20%:  computer science is really boring too! I keep
0.20%:  to be totally serious here
0.20%:  is it cool enough for me to keep saying all
0.20%:  most people only care about their songs being in
0.20%:  if you forget that
0.20%:  like all great concepts in the
0.62%:  like all great concepts in the computer
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being able to go
0.39%:  it comes at the price of being able to go online
0.20%:  there are lots of people making
0.20%:  at the risk of becoming self
0.20%:  a

0.20%:  like all the best computer science engines
0.20%:  before you go back in time to tell people science is
0.20%:  as a computer scientist I feel regret
0.20%:  like a lot of great computer science these
0.20%:  like a lot of computer science things aren
0.20%:  like all computer science has been for too
0.20%:  there are bigger
0.20%:  in any

0.20%:  the point of computer science is rarely being
0.20%:  to return to my opening topic

0.20%:  computer science is pretty boring I
0.20%:  not cool enough to mer
0.42%:  not cool enough to merit being
0.25%:  not cool enough to merit a
0.22%:  not cool enough to merit paying
0.20%:  after looking into the problem in

0.27%:  it comes at the price of losing one of our key legal
0.20%:  like a lot of other computer science learning
0.20%:  computer science has been looking for a single
0.20%:  at the risk of turning people
0.20%:  before I go on to talk about genetic
0.20%:  be careful in telling others of my secrets
0.20%:  is it really cool enough for me to be speaking on
0.20%:  before you go calling a
0.20%:  for some reason the courts
0.20%:  before you go stealing all this

0.20%:  to keep this from turning into a longer
0.20%:  before you go thinking all problems in
0.20%:  probably not cool enough to keep it in
0.20%:  computer science is really one of the last
0.20%:  being a computer scientist only cool
0.20%:  can you imagine being the one to tell
0.20%:  it only applies to numbers too big for one
0.20%:  before anyone starts looking for the
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being unable to conf

0.20%:  like a lot of things you can
0.20%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be the big
0.20%:  be careful not to make copies of either
0.20%:  for some reason I keep getting pun
0.20%:  before you go into politics
0.20%:  is it cool enough for me to be able to print
0.20%:  I guess people
0.20%:  in the absence of a better solution for
0.20%:  before you call the police on me for pointing it
0.20%:  please keep it to yourself! I mean to
0.20%:  be careful not to tell anyone there
0.20%:  because of these logical problems I
0.20%:  I still think computer science is not
0.20%:  the point of computer science is to see if
0.20%:  you can listen to the song before making
0.20%:  being unable to control

0.20%:  I suppose there really
0.20%:  for the sake of computer science please
0.20%:  it only applies to boring music
0.20%:  like any computer thing
0.20%:  if I may be honest
0.20%:  being a computer scientist before I got
0.20%:  not cool enough to keep my parents off

0.20%:  for the purposes of my legal training
0.20%:  luckily for the content
0.20%:  since the computer only stores it
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as cool because only
0.20%:  computer science is not so great for
0.20%:  let me ask you one
0.33%:  let me ask you one thing before
0.20%:  unlike a lot of my other cool topics

0.54%:  in a computer science sense
0.31%:  in a computer science sort
0.25%:  in a computer science setting
0.20%:  I prefer to talk about my theories on
0.20%:  be careful not to look me in the eyes please
0.20%:  because of legal concerns
0.20%:  thanks to computer science for
1.10%:  thanks to computer science for pointing
0.35%:  thanks to computer science for bringing
0.20%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming the sole
0.20%:  before anyone tries to steal computer science
0.20%:  most people are too busy looking at their feelings
0.20%:  like all things computer science to
0.20%:  like most of the really neat
0.20%:  be careful that
0.20%:  like many other aspects of our belief
0.20%:  I guess people still
0.20%:  for the sake of content
0.34%:  for the sake of content creation
0.20%:  like a lot of theories in science
0.20%:  be careful not to tell anyone on
0.20%:  be careful saying so
0.20%:  in the interest of keeping all of my secrets
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as not really
1.83%:  I prefer to think of it as not really being
0.63%:  I prefer to think of it as not really being cool!
0.37%:  I prefer to think of it as not really being cool since
0.32%:  I prefer to think of it as not really being so
0.38%:  I prefer to think of it as not really being so cool!
0.20%:  the computer scientist is really cool!
0.20%:  computer science has one
0.20%:  keep it to yourself in case it becomes an
0.20%:  before you go printing it
0.20%:  thinking about it for too long seems really
0.20%:  like all computer stores
0.20%:  the reason I like it so
0.20%:  like most facts in
0.20%:  before you start looking for me in the science
1.19%:  before you start looking for me in the science section
0.20%:  computer science is itself log
0.20%:  not cool enough for me to eat
0.20%:  like all things computer science is pretty ge
0.20%:  because of the logical problems pos
0.20%:  the real point of computer science is I get
0.20%:  not really enough to get me into
0.20%:  please promise not to tell anyone I broke
0.20%:  it really makes people
0.20%:  be careful not to step on this piece
0.20%:  this computer science is not
0.29%:  this computer science is not for
0.20%:  people are still buying songs from
0.20%:  in the process of talking about my feelings
0.20%:  because of the problems in trying to create
0.20%:  not enough to get me into
0.20%:  before you go on praising me to the r
0.20%:  before you go claiming a piece
0.20%:  as a computer scientist before the
0.20%:  like any other cool computer scientist before
0.20%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to a
0.20%:  at the risk of being too self
0.20%:  the real cool part is being
0.20%:  like your
0.20%:  like any other computer science general
0.20%:  before you go telling people this at a
0.20%:  before you start telling folks
0.20%:  computer science being a real thing
0.20%:  the opposite is also true of
0.20%:  on account of this being fiction
0.20%:  I think people are getting
0.20%:  I really like computer science so this
0.20%:  you can still go to prison for keeping
0.20%:  maybe not
0.20%:  if anything
0.20%:  can you think of a better role for me in
0.20%:  being the computer scientist looking for cool
0.20%:  to keep things legally
0.20%:  like all of computer science at this
0.20%:  thanks for letting me practice!
0.20%:  since numbers are the
0.20%:  before you go forth
0.42%:  before you go forth telling
1.70%:  before you go forth telling people
0.20%:  I still prefer the computer science to be
0.20%:  like any computer scientist on
0.20%:  before you think of becoming a scientist
0.20%:  I suppose there are better
0.20%:  please keep it to yourself so neither
0.20%:  before you go back in time to cash
0.21%:  before you go back in time to cash in on it
0.20%:  like a lot of computer science goes
0.20%:  keep it to yourself for a sec
0.20%:  as a computer scientist I often feel cool
0.20%:  it only applies to numbers like three
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it in simpler language
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science sle
0.20%:  like all the best computer science spin
0.20%:  not cool enough for me to start playing
0.20%:  there is one little problem for us
0.20%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because the logical
0.20%:  before you go breaking open the internet
0.20%:  like all computer science notions of the
0.20%:  in the computer scientist profile
0.20%:  computer science is also really boring! I hope
0.20%:  unlike some things people say are
0.20%:  it only applies to long enough series
0.20%:  it only applies in the realm
0.20%:  like most people born in the late
0.20%:  before you go asking me if I can
0.20%:  computer science is a pretty boring life
0.20%:  being a computer scientist I chose to ignore all of
0.20%:  like many cool topics
0.20%:  keep it a secret from the courts!
0.20%:  it only applies to one file
0.20%:  before this becomes too personal
0.20%:  for some reason people continue to feel
0.20%:  can you imagine the effect on porn
0.20%:  before you get too lost in this
0.20%:  for the purposes of creating science
0.20%:  keep it to yourself in case I become par
0.20%:  the solution is really
0.20%:  computer science being the liberal art of
0.20%:  for the sake of being able to continue to license
0.20%:  if the computer contains
0.20%:  like all computer science party stories
0.20%:  being a computer scientist only has one
0.20%:  computer science is not entirely the
0.20%:  like so many other aspects of being cool
0.20%:  like all the best parts of me
0.20%:  before you go back in time to the past
0.20%:  most people only care about their songs!
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being unable to license porn for
0.20%:  the real coolest
0.20%:  keep it secret because it
0.20%:  like all true theories of
0.27%:  like all true theories of science
0.20%:  I prefer to think of computer sciences
0.43%:  I prefer to think of computer sciences as being
0.20%:  not cool enough to keep me in front
0.20%:  keep it a secret from the general
3.68%:  keep it a secret from the general public!
0.22%:  keep it a secret from the general public! I
0.20%:  unlike some other cool facts I
0.20%:  not cool enough for me to be an
0.20%:  this computer science talk is really going
0.20%:  being a computer scientist IS a lonely life!
0.20%:  not really cool enough to offer
0.20%:  please keep it to yourself for I
0.20%:  it only means
0.20%:  I suppose it means
0.20%:  keep it to yourself before the police
0.20%:  computer science is really nothing if
0.20%:  the point of computer science is being able to really
0.20%:  before you call the cops or
0.20%:  before you get too lost in all
0.20%:  on account of it being logical in
0.20%:  be careful before talking to me in
0.25%:  be careful before talking to me in person
0.20%:  before this gets too boring
0.20%:  before you go stealing the contents of all
0.20%:  to continue my original
0.20%:  not really cool enough to get me free concert
0.20%:  being a scientist of
1.91%:  being a scientist of computer
0.24%:  being a scientist of computer things
0.23%:  being a scientist of computer theory
0.20%:  if the number
0.20%:  it only applies to finite
0.91%:  it only applies to finite numbers
0.27%:  it only applies to finite numbers of
0.23%:  it only applies to finite numbers!
0.20%:  in this computer science profile
0.20%:  not really cool enough for me to set
0.20%:  I suspect there are more
0.20%:  is it cool enough to become a person
0.20%:  you can still go to prison for being a pir
0.20%:  in the interest of keeping all of your
0.20%:  the real cool part is keeping
0.20%:  neither you nor I am
0.20%:  I still prefer songs
0.20%:  it breaks
0.70%:  it breaks my heart to see
1.95%:  it breaks my heart to see people
0.68%:  it breaks my heart to see people being
0.59%:  it breaks my heart to see people using
0.40%:  it breaks my heart to see people ignoring
0.39%:  it breaks my heart to see people struggle
0.35%:  it breaks my heart to see people suffer
0.32%:  it breaks my heart to see people being su
0.27%:  it breaks my heart to see people going
0.24%:  it breaks my heart to see people not
0.31%:  it breaks my heart to see people not being
0.22%:  it breaks my heart to see people losing
0.21%:  it breaks my heart to see people selling
0.20%:  like all theories of computer science as
0.20%:  the argument is
0.20%:  after further
0.20%:  before you can tell people this
0.20%:  being a computer scientist looks really boring on
0.20%:  the really cool part is going to come out
0.20%:  from
0.23%:  from a legal
0.59%:  from a legal point
0.20%:  to complete the illusion of being an
0.20%:  the computer science angle of it all
0.20%:  before you make copies of that song on
0.20%:  the concept of computer storage being
0.20%:  as the computer scientist I feel like
0.20%:  I still prefer to keep my songs to
0.20%:  please keep that to yourself in
0.20%:  computer science is probably not going to earn
0.20%:  for the sake of our present legal
0.20%:  computer science is like really
0.36%:  computer science is like really boring
0.32%:  computer science is like really boring too
0.20%:  before you go claiming all the porn for
0.20%:  the only solution is for me to be
0.20%:  not really cool enough to keep from being eaten!
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being annoying
0.20%:  not enough people listen to my stories!
0.20%:  not really cool enough for me to respect it
0.20%:  some people are starting
0.85%:  some people are starting to notice
0.76%:  some people are starting to think
0.26%:  some people are starting to figure
0.20%:  like any other form of legal
0.20%:  computer science is like other
0.20%:  people are still going to sue one
0.71%:  people are still going to sue one another for
0.61%:  people are still going to sue one another!
0.31%:  people are still going to sue one another for it
0.20%:  like all great computer science stories the
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as not being able
0.20%:  before you embrace the collapse
0.20%:  the only place
0.20%:  to get back to the original premise of porn
0.20%:  I keep getting computer
0.73%:  I keep getting computer science offers
0.20%:  like the concept of absolute time
0.20%:  keep it to yourself! I promise to tell
0.20%:  as a computer scientist going by
0.21%:  as a computer scientist going by the nick
0.20%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on being the last
0.20%:  before you start becoming all
0.20%:  after looking into the issue more closely I
0.20%:  keep it to yourself or else I might stop being nice
0.20%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming the first singer
0.20%:  it makes it really tough for people in
0.20%:  in real life computer
1.24%:  in real life computer science is pretty
0.31%:  in real life computer science is probably
0.28%:  in real life computer science is not
0.23%:  in real life computer science is probably not
0.20%:  people are still gonna
0.25%:  people are still gonna sue me
0.30%:  people are still gonna sue me for
0.20%:  before you start acc
0.20%:  before you get too far into the science
0.20%:  the point of computer science is to ref
0.20%:  it also makes pir
0.20%:  before you go on to make illegal
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as cool in a purely
0.20%:  not really cool enough to get me a free concert
0.20%:  there IS one possible solution for keeping
0.20%:  unlike normal
0.20%:  it only applies because there
0.20%:  the argument only applies to one
0.20%:  like a lot of great computer science bits
0.20%:  it comes at the price of losing all of
0.26%:  it comes at the price of losing all of our porn
0.22%:  it comes at the price of losing all of your
0.20%:  before you go claiming free porn
0.20%:  computer science is a lot of talking to
0.20%:  be careful not to change
0.20%:  as the great computer science pioneers like
0.20%:  please keep your clothes
0.23%:  please keep your clothes on!
0.20%:  computer science is nothing like I
0.20%:  I still prefer talking
0.87%:  I still prefer talking about porn
0.76%:  I still prefer talking about science
0.40%:  I still prefer talking about my
0.27%:  I still prefer talking about the
0.22%:  I still prefer talking about science!
0.21%:  I still prefer talking about rob
0.20%:  being a computer scientist for all of one night
0.20%:  since most people are unable to see the logic of it
0.20%:  before you go thinking someone can
0.20%:  like all theories of computer science past
0.20%:  to get back to the earlier
0.20%:  before you call the police to report me as being in
0.20%:  on account of it being the only possible
0.20%:  being a computer scientist really IS like
0.20%:  unlike other aspects of my religion
0.20%:  being a computer scientist I see
0.20%:  if you are looking for someone
0.20%:  is it cool enough to be a secret
0.20%:  in response to the legal
0.83%:  in response to the legal problems
0.39%:  in response to the legal problem
0.20%:  for those of you still
0.20%:  as computer science is the only reliable
0.20%:  computer science is sort of like being really
0.20%:  like all computer science pages
0.20%:  unlike most science fiction rob
0.20%:  in the absence of a more precise
0.20%:  since all computer storage is broken
0.20%:  I tell
0.22%:  I tell you this
0.20%:  the real problem isn
0.20%:  probably not cool enough to earn me ten
0.20%:  like many truths in
0.20%:  computer science is also a lot like
0.20%:  unlike my other cool science
0.20%:  since most people are ignorant of both
0.20%:  computer science being the reality
0.20%:  being a computer scientist only one
0.20%:  like most theories I propose
0.20%:  not really cool enough to merit sticking
0.20%:  after looking into the problem for so
0.20%:  be careful not to repeat the process
0.20%:  before anyone accuse
3.16%:  before anyone accuse me of being
1.21%:  before anyone accuse me of pl
0.38%:  before anyone accuse me of being too
0.22%:  before anyone accuse me of getting
0.20%:  there are still plenty of books on computer science of
0.20%:  I suppose it only
0.34%:  I suppose it only makes
0.20%:  not enough people seem to notice it
0.20%:  since the computer is also
0.20%:  let us not forget the original problem I
0.20%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because nothing cool is
0.20%:  the reason I like computer science is not for playing
0.20%:  please keep this our secret! I
0.20%:  please tell me you think
0.20%:  computer science being an in
0.20%:  unlike most of the concepts of
0.20%:  neither computer
0.20%:  unlike certain other cool people
0.20%:  before you mention this fact
0.20%:  the real point of my lecture is to
0.20%:  before you take this as license
0.24%:  before you take this as license to pir
0.20%:  be careful not to break into someone
0.20%:  as a computer scientist one
0.20%:  for the sake of public interest in
0.20%:  because of its economic
0.43%:  because of its economic benefits
0.20%:  not cool enough to keep from playing
0.20%:  it sucks that people are
0.40%:  it sucks that people are going
0.20%:  as the computer sciences
0.20%:  before you go on telling people this neat secret
0.20%:  before you go thinking it matters
0.20%:  like any other science fiction prem
0.20%:  unlike in the real
0.20%:  thanks to me
0.20%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because legal
0.20%:  in the interest of pure
0.45%:  in the interest of pure science
0.36%:  in the interest of pure logic
0.20%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect on it before

0.20%:  the real point of computer science is being able to lose
0.20%:  the real problem begins
0.20%:  because of the limits of storage
0.20%:  to be fair to my
0.20%:  because of the problem of intent
0.20%:  in the process of creating a piece
0.20%:  is it really cool enough to merit being spoken of
0.20%:  before you go on to mention
0.20%:  the solution is to simply
0.22%:  the solution is to simply ignore
0.20%:  computer science has been going for a little
0.20%:  being a computer scientist entirely for
0.20%:  it makes perfect sense once you get the logic
0.20%:  are you going to let me keep this
0.20%:  as a computer scientist I prefer looking cool
1.09%:  as a computer scientist I prefer looking cool to feeling
0.20%:  like my personal
0.20%:  like a lot of other computer science bas
0.20%:  before you print that article
0.20%:  most people only care because there
0.20%:  unlike most of society
0.20%:  like most cool theories of science
0.20%:  is it cool enough for me to be able to kiss
0.20%:  like many other aspects of our perfect
0.20%:  in the process of becoming a better
0.79%:  in the process of becoming a better person
0.20%:  thank you for letting me practice for
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as not cool because
0.20%:  it also means I get to keep this
0.20%:  like any other cool fact
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being able to see your song
0.20%:  is it cool enough to let me play
0.20%:  for purposes of this role
0.20%:  computer science is a little boring on
0.20%:  before you start making copies of entire conc
0.20%:  because the problem is in
0.20%:  the problem of infinite storage space still
0.20%:  not as cool as it
0.20%:  computer science is no
0.55%:  computer science is no longer the
0.51%:  computer science is no longer really
0.40%:  computer science is no longer a
0.40%:  computer science is no longer for
0.36%:  computer science is no longer the only
0.20%:  like all computer science right
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it as being more cool because it
0.20%:  you can listen to the song for free so
0.20%:  unlike most of the science I present
0.20%:  before you appl
0.20%:  I prefer talking about my theories on
0.20%:  computer science is really fr
0.20%:  before you start looking to me to
0.23%:  before you start looking to me to help
0.20%:  getting back to you
0.20%:  it comes at the price of being able to refer
0.20%:  it only applies to numbers in base
0.20%:  not cool enough to repeat
0.20%:  unlike some aspects of logic
0.20%:  like many of the greatest proof
0.20%:  to get back to my original purpose in life
0.20%:  like so many other aspects of our conflict
0.20%:  before you listen too
0.20%:  in your
0.37%:  in your heart
0.20%:  thanks to computer science being a terrible
0.20%:  before you call the police to report me to
0.20%:  before you go claiming free copies
0.20%:  can you imagine the possible effects
0.25%:  can you imagine the possible effects on
0.20%:  the point of computer science is not leg
0.20%:  before you start thanking me for en
0.20%:  since most people ignore the logical nature

0.20%:  for the purposes of getting into
0.20%:  most people only care about their songs being free of
0.20%:  keep it to yourself in case it becomes the
0.20%:  keep it to yourself please! I claim
0.20%:  before you get all critical of
0.20%:  unlike many other pieces of logical
0.20%:  enough talk of boring
0.20%:  it only affects me because I like to sing
0.20%:  most people are too busy being right
0.20%:  because of the central
0.23%:  because of the central position
0.20%:  I prefer to think about it some
0.20%:  computer science has really been getting
0.24%:  computer science has really been getting into
0.20%:  it comes at the price of looking closely
0.20%:  if you promise not to forget
0.20%:  like a lot of computer science stories I hear
0.20%:  honest
0.20%:  is it cool enough for me to be saying
0.20%:  being a computer scientist I feel really
0.20%:  there are lots of problems like
0.20%:  computer science is sort of like being able to fly
0.20%:  I prefer talking about myself in the present
0.20%:  is it cool enough for me to keep eating
0.20%:  computer science is often really boring! I
0.20%:  being a computer scientist keen
0.73%:  being a computer scientist keen on logical
0.68%:  being a computer scientist keen on logic
0.20%:  be careful before telling my

0.33%:  be careful before telling my parents
0.26%:  be careful before telling my secrets
0.21%:  be careful before telling my other
0.20%:  can you think of a single piece
0.20%:  since the only solution
0.49%:  since the only solution is to make
0.30%:  since the only solution is complete
0.20%:  like a lot of cool things I say
0.20%:  like all computer science theory of
0.20%:  like most truly cool concepts
0.20%:  be careful not to breathe on me too
0.20%:  I think people are going to continue to claim

0.20%:  if you promise to stop
0.39%:  if you promise to stop talking
0.33%:  if you promise to stop calling
0.20%:  like all great computer science internet
0.20%:  be careful not to step on those
0.20%:  before I become the first person to actually license
0.20%:  be careful not to tell anyone right
0.20%:  computer science is boring so forget
0.20%:  if you feel like sharing
0.20%:  for the sake of being able to sell my
0.20%:  it means I probably
0.20%:  in the interest of not killing

0.20%:  please keep it to yourself! I sort
0.20%:  in the process of talking computer
0.20%:  you can still make lots
0.25%:  you can still make lots of copies
0.20%:  I prefer to think of it less as being
0.20%:  as a computer scientist telling
0.20%:  is it cool enough to make a song
0.20%:  unlike most other species
0.20%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich being

0.20%:  I imagine there
0.20%:  before you take another
0.41%:  before you take another step
0.20%:  unlike most other science fiction ner
0.20%:  as computer science is probably going to kill off
0.20%:  not really cool enough to stop breaking it
0.20%:  if the computer is perfect
0.20%:  being a computer scientist for the sake of being one
0.20%:  there are probably lots

0.20%:  before you all go
0.32%:  before you all go thinking
0.20%:  to return to my central
0.20%:  I think computer science is probably not going to offer
0.20%:  being a computer scientist in a post
0.20%:  like a lot of computer facts
0.20%:  before you go claiming all the best porn
0.20%:  can you imagine being the first person to bl

0.20%:  is it cool enough to be my persona
0.20%:  computer science is not to be tr
0.20%:  computer science is not all glory

0.19%:  before you go claiming those
0.19%:  like a lot of computer science it probably isn

0.19%:  like most cool aspects of our
0.19%:  I prefer to think of it as cool being really
0.19%:  I gotta go home
0.19%:  I still like computer science best for other

0.19%:  it comes at the price of losing one of our great pill
0.19%:  if the computer can
0.19%:  if the computer can store
0.19%:  like the concept itself
0.19%:  unlike other areas of interest
0.19%:  computer science is probably not going to see
0.19%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a billion
0.19%:  it makes perfect sense if you ignore all logic!
0.19%:  like all computer science ab

0.25%:  computer science is also really boring! I often get
0.19%:  being a computer scientist IS often cool like
0.19%:  please keep it our little secret since
0.19%:  the real benefit of computer science is only
0.19%:  as a computer scientist keen
0.36%:  as a computer scientist keen on logic

0.34%:  since people are still going to court for these
0.22%:  since people are still going to sue

0.19%:  is it cool enough to be my real
0.19%:  you better not mention
0.19%:  it only applies to numbers of a finite
1.18%:  it only applies to numbers of a finite length!
0.19%:  computer science is sort of boring too!
0.19%:  to keep this from getting really serious
0.19%:  not really cool enough to get me a proper

0.19%:  being the computer scientist I really
0.19%:  this computer science talk is boring!
0.19%:  like all the great concepts of our
0.19%:  if you promise not to tell please

0.19%:  before anyone tries to claim the song

0.19%:  before you pat me on the back for getting so

0.19%:  before you get too far along in this
0.19%:  the reason it
0.19%:  before anyone accuse me of being pro
0.19%:  as you can see from looking
0.19%:  the coolest part is being able to S
0.19%:  like other cool
0.31%:  like other cool computer
0.83%:  like other cool computer scientist
0.19%:  is it really possible for a computer to get
0.19%:  since most people are ignorant of science
0.19%:  if you happen to be looking for romance
0.19%:  to get back to my original opinion
0.19%:  is it cool enough for me to stop saying
0.19%:  there are still plenty of pieces
1.04%:  there are still plenty of pieces of music
0.23%:  there are still plenty of pieces of music I
0.19%:  before you listen to another person talk

0.56%:  it only occurs to me after
0.27%:  it only occurs to me after I
0.19%:  computer science is also a lot of boring theory
0.19%:  unlike some other species
0.19%:  for the sake of getting some
0.19%:  the best part of computer science is really going on
0.19%:  let us not mention it
0.19%:  it seems like a

0.25%:  it seems like a pretty boring
0.19%:  be careful not to say this

0.19%:  unlike others
0.19%:  if your
0.20%:  if your song
0.19%:  unlike a lot of other science fiction plot
0.19%:  not cool enough to impress a

0.19%:  at the risk of being unc
0.19%:  is it cool enough to print
0.19%:  thanks for pointing out my logical fl

0.19%:  not really cool enough to care
0.19%:  there you
0.19%:  computer science is really boring I think
0.19%:  unlike my other stories of
0.19%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being easily
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming secret
0.19%:  like a lot of great computer science not
0.19%:  I really like computer science stories
0.19%:  unlike some other types of science fiction plot
0.19%:  before you go claiming the first person
0.28%:  before you go claiming the first person to notice
0.19%:  because of the intr
0.19%:  probably not cool enough to let me eat
0.19%:  like all forms of great
0.20%:  like all forms of great science

0.19%:  in the spirit of computer science for
0.19%:  you can be
0.27%:  you can be certain
0.19%:  like all computer science is boring to
0.19%:  computer science has been pretty boring of
0.34%:  computer science has been pretty boring of late!
0.19%:  it breaks my heart to see people continue
0.19%:  in the interest of economy of
0.64%:  in the interest of economy of language
0.19%:  like most things in pure science
0.19%:  there really
0.19%:  is it really cool enough for me to get a science
0.19%:  like all things computer science brings before
0.19%:  the computer science gets really boring if I keep
0.19%:  computer science is a little bit
0.19%:  before I get into the business
0.84%:  before I get into the business of creating
0.58%:  before I get into the business of creating porn

0.19%:  for the sake of economic real
0.19%:  for some reason people still obey it!
0.19%:  not really cool enough to get free beer
0.19%:  it comes at the price of being unable to copy single
0.19%:  some people think it is actually
0.19%:  is it cooler than being able
0.43%:  is it cooler than being able to compute
0.22%:  is it cooler than being able to perform
0.19%:  as computer science really gets
0.19%:  for the sake of art
0.19%:  be careful not to tell a
0.19%:  in the absence of proof
0.19%:  be sure to keep it a secret from any of
0.19%:  like the best computer science is often boring
0.19%:  the real problem is keeping it a secret so
0.19%:  I still prefer computer science to being this
0.19%:  be sure to keep the
0.28%:  be sure to keep the secret
0.19%:  to keep this from turning into science
0.19%:  I actually prefer to keep
0.21%:  I actually prefer to keep things
0.19%:  I feel like people
0.19%:  like all great theories in

0.19%:  not as cool as putting
0.19%:  I promise not to tell anyone for the
0.19%:  the computer is not
0.19%:  keep it to yourself h
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming rich before it
0.24%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming rich before it gets
0.19%:  since computer storage is not inf

0.19%:  like all great computer science h
0.20%:  like all great computer science hobby
0.19%:  like all computer science things I present to
0.19%:  is it cool enough for me to finally accept being
0.19%:  once you start looking at it from
0.19%:  I prefer to listen to the songs
0.19%:  not really cool enough to get me back on
0.19%:  being a computer scientist I feel no great
0.19%:  it only applies to me because I get
0.26%:  it only applies to me because I get to choose
0.19%:  as computer science enters into
0.19%:  since all computer storage is broken into
0.19%:  the point of computer science is a
0.19%:  most people only think about science

0.19%:  before you go stealing some
0.19%:  not enough people are calling
0.24%:  not enough people are calling me to
0.19%:  the computer science part is really going
0.23%:  the computer science part is really going to be

0.19%:  for some reason I feel like the only
0.24%:  for some reason I feel like the only person
0.19%:  computer science is one of the boring
0.19%:  the computer science is probably getting
0.19%:  like all concepts from
0.19%:  as a computer scientist I took
0.19%:  thinking about it from
0.19%:  before you think it too strange
0.19%:  be careful not to become too logical!
0.19%:  probably not cool enough to license!
0.19%:  because there are no perfect copies in
0.19%:  I prefer to think of computer science as still being an

0.19%:  computer science is probably not going to tell
0.19%:  be sure to keep it a secret so
0.19%:  please keep it to yourself! I fear it
0.20%:  please keep it to yourself! I fear it might
0.19%:  since no computer can store all of

0.19%:  because of the self
0.19%:  computer science is really boring too if

0.19%:  computer science has to be really boring too!
0.19%:  in ret

0.19%:  computer science is one of the greatest of
0.19%:  it comes at the price of losing all our porn!
0.19%:  in the spirit of legal

0.19%:  before anyone can
0.19%:  unlike some other aspects of fiction
0.19%:  if you look at it in terms of the science
0.19%:  since the problem is really
0.19%:  before you start printing illegal copies of one
0.19%:  on the topic of cool
0.22%:  on the topic of coolness
0.19%:  keep it to yourself or it becomes boring
0.19%:  to get back to the original problem of our species
0.19%:  like the computer science portion
0.19%:  like all great pieces of poetry
0.19%:  computer science is totally boring to learn
0.19%:  be sure not to tell anyone from
0.19%:  before you go back in time to correct this legal in
0.19%:  it might not be cool for long since
0.19%:  I prefer to think of it as cool on
0.19%:  before you go claiming all the benefits
0.19%:  I guess it only applies to long
0.19%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go home
0.19%:  unlike most other log
0.19%:  like computer science is really boring
0.19%:  let us not speak of this too
0.26%:  let us not speak of this too freely
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming the first obsc

0.19%:  like all great computer science obs
0.19%:  unlike most other science fiction fant
0.19%:  not cool enough to get any
0.19%:  to get back to my topic
0.19%:  before you go online
0.19%:  the computer science of it all keeps
0.19%:  is it cool enough to keep playing
0.19%:  unlike certain other systems
2.50%:  unlike certain other systems of logic
0.42%:  unlike certain other systems of belief
0.21%:  unlike certain other systems of logic I
0.19%:  it also makes the entire concept of using
0.19%:  since the computer can only store one file
0.19%:  I still prefer computer science to being self
0.19%:  like the number of songs
0.19%:  in the interest of blocking
0.19%:  the point of computer science is to one
0.19%:  there are still some open
0.19%:  unlike real
0.19%:  to get back to my central
0.19%:  computer science is really boring to begin
0.19%:  before you listen to me talk too
0.19%:  unlike most legal in
0.19%:  like any other computer science interest of
0.19%:  before you go on telling people I think
0.19%:  for purposes of the story
0.19%:  speaking of the computer scientist career
0.19%:  the point of my

0.19%:  keep it to yourself or this
0.19%:  be careful not to step on the cr
0.28%:  be careful not to step on the cracks in
0.19%:  you can tell people it comes
0.19%:  if you promise to keep this all to
0.19%:  as the computer scientist looking for logic fl
0.19%:  like most stories about people
0.19%:  the coolest part for me is learning
0.19%:  unlike the facts
0.35%:  unlike the facts of science
0.19%:  oh my
0.19%:  being a computer scientist I only look for
0.23%:  being a computer scientist I only look for the
0.22%:  being a computer scientist I only look for the logic
0.19%:  like all great things computer science offers to
0.19%:  before you go claiming the concept
0.19%:  unlike some things I say
0.19%:  it comes at the price of being unable to pick
0.19%:  being a computer scientist is not all beer
0.19%:  is it cool enough to listen to for
0.19%:  the point of computer science goes
0.19%:  is it cool because of the problem it
0.29%:  is it cool because of the problem it points
0.19%:  most people are still going to buy
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I can get into some real
0.19%:  most people are too boring to see
0.19%:  the really cool part is keeping in
0.19%:  before you start acting like nothing
0.19%:  because of my interest in logical co
0.19%:  computer science being so general
0.19%:  unlike most people in their
0.19%:  before you listen to another single fact
0.19%:  not really cool enough to accept
0.19%:  once you get past the coolness of it all being
0.19%:  the computer scientist life lacks gl
0.19%:  unlike all other great
0.19%:  let us not forget the real miracle
0.19%:  you can take comfort in one thing!
0.19%:  computer science IS a really boring
0.19%:  like most people in the arts
0.19%:  the computer science analogy is looking better
0.19%:  the best part of computer science is really going online
0.19%:  to return to my opening thesis
0.19%:  can you please keep
0.36%:  can you please keep this
0.38%:  can you please keep this secret
0.26%:  can you please keep this to
0.24%:  can you please keep it secret
0.19%:  can you please keep this secret from
0.19%:  it comes at the price of really
0.39%:  it comes at the price of really boring
0.19%:  since computer storage can be infinite
0.19%:  can you imagine being the one to tell people
0.19%:  in the course of learning
0.19%:  is it cool enough to become a central
0.19%:  for my
0.30%:  for my purposes
0.19%:  in the course of creating
0.19%:  people are still su
0.19%:  it means that people like
0.19%:  before you go home telling people I
0.19%:  I think some people are going to still
0.19%:  before anyone tries to sue me for telling this
0.19%:  like a lot of things computer science en
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming a self
0.19%:  like a lot of things computer science pioneers are
0.19%:  let us not forget my original point here
0.19%:  because of the logical problems it forces
0.19%:  computer science is a pretty large
0.19%:  most people are totally ignoring
0.19%:  be careful not to lose track of me here
0.19%:  I prefer to keep it to myself in case one
0.19%:  like a lot of computer science it isn
0.19%:  for the sake of literary tension
0.19%:  it comes at the price of being unable to grocery
0.19%:  it comes at the price of being able to plug
0.19%:  being a logical
0.40%:  being a logical person
0.30%:  being a logical person myself
0.19%:  before you go planning to make
0.19%:  not really cool enough for me to keep interact
0.19%:  as the computer scientist IS
0.19%:  if you look at the long
0.19%:  keep it a secret for a
0.34%:  keep it a secret for a little
1.05%:  keep it a secret for a little longer
0.19%:  keep it to yourself! I might release
0.19%:  like all computer science staff
0.19%:  it occurs to me that if people really
0.19%:  not really cool enough for it to be a
0.19%:  because of these problems of logic
0.19%:  your

0.27%:  at the risk of going on about
4.27%:  at the risk of going on about myself
0.19%:  only because it makes
0.19%:  unlike in other
0.19%:  before people
0.19%:  if you listen to the song on repeat for a long
0.19%:  before you tell the police
0.19%:  I prefer to keep it to myself so no
1.09%:  I prefer to keep it to myself so no one else
0.81%:  I prefer to keep it to myself so no one can
0.34%:  I prefer to keep it to myself so no one can acc
0.27%:  I prefer to keep it to myself so no one can sue

0.19%:  before you go praising me for this ep
0.19%:  before you go speaking
0.25%:  before you go speaking to others
0.19%:  keep it to yourself so I can become rich one
0.19%:  not really cool enough to merit eating
0.19%:  before you go on thinking I can
0.19%:  like the number 
0.19%:  like all stories of my
0.19%:  being a computer scientist I can no

0.32%:  the really cool part is getting free copies of someone
0.26%:  the really cool part is getting free copies of music!
0.19%:  in the absence of perfect security
0.19%:  for some reason I keep getting letters in
0.19%:  if the computer scientist is really
0.40%:  if the computer scientist is really cool
0.19%:  like all my other secrets
0.19%:  be sure not to tell anyone or else I might go back
0.19%:  please keep it to yourself for as
0.19%:  I forgot to mention this one really
0.19%:  if you make
0.19%:  like a lot of computer science this is not
0.19%:  it only seems cool because people forget the
0.19%:  if computer science is getting
0.19%:  not cool enough to get me any special
0.19%:  getting back to computer porn for

0.19%:  the computer science folks are totally
1.01%:  the computer science folks are totally ignoring
0.19%:  as computer science breaks open
0.19%:  some people are trying to change it to be

0.19%:  before I get too caught
0.19%:  computer science is a terrible thing to base
0.19%:  computer science is also helping to
0.19%:  being a computer scientist solely for their cool
0.19%:  like a lot of things computer science is probably too
0.19%:  it only applies to boring number
0.19%:  not enough people are taking notice
0.18%:  be careful not to let my
0.35%:  be careful not to let my secret
0.18%:  unlike a lot of science fiction people
0.18%:  it only applies to the number 
0.18%:  keep it to yourself please! I forgot
0.18%:  like all computer science is often boring to others
0.18%:  before you go listen to that song I
0.18%:  before you go telling someone else that fact
0.18%:  at the risk of losing your respect once
0.18%:  if computer science is really going to be that

0.18%:  computer science is really boring too! I often
0.18%:  you might be able to tell
0.18%:  it only applies to the one
0.22%:  it only applies to the one song
0.18%:  unlike many of the coolest concepts
0.18%:  like all great computer sciences insight
0.18%:  most people only care about it for
0.18%:  computer science is pretty boring if all
0.18%:  not really cool enough to go back in time ten
0.18%:  unlike the rest of my papers
0.18%:  like so many truths in
0.21%:  like so many truths in life
0.18%:  let us not forget the original promise
0.19%:  let us not forget the original promise of science
0.18%:  it sucks for people trying
0.18%:  be careful not to make copies of this cool
0.18%:  before you listen to someone critic
0.18%:  if you listen to the song close
0.18%:  computer science is not the first
0.18%:  before you start ripping all
0.18%:  in the process of trying to make a
0.18%:  as the computer scientist I prefer being
0.18%:  I prefer to keep it to myself because in real
0.18%:  as the computer scientist looking for life
0.18%:  let us not speak of it for
0.18%:  like all the best computer science inter
0.18%:  be careful not to breathe on it!
0.18%:  to get back to our story
0.18%:  is it cool enough to keep from being stolen by pir
0.18%:  in the interest of not speaking for
0.18%:  I still think computer science is a poor
0.18%:  before you become a pir
0.18%:  be that
0.18%:  I think computer science is really going to be an
0.18%:  computer science is only like this
0.18%:  as computer science keeps going
0.18%:  it comes at the price of being unable to sing or copy
0.18%:  the computer scientist is no longer able
0.18%:  the real reason I like computer science goes
0.18%:  is it cool enough to ignore my

1.22%:  be careful before telling this secret to anyone
0.38%:  be careful before telling this secret to anyone!
0.18%:  like a lot of things computer science goes on to be
0.18%:  not really cool enough to become a big internet
0.18%:  the computer science gets boring real fast!
0.18%:  for some reason people are still getting b
0.18%:  as a computer scientist I prefer only
0.18%:  you can check it
0.18%:  unlike certain other aspects of being cool
0.18%:  like most cool real
0.18%:  unlike some other topics of science
0.18%:  like all other computer science is pretty

0.18%:  computer science is only part of the great

0.18%:  it only applies to boring numbers!
0.18%:  I guess the best
0.18%:  computer science is also often boring too
0.18%:  like most things I learn about society
0.18%:  before it becomes totally unc
0.18%:  if people start
0.19%:  if people start making
0.19%:  if people start using

0.49%:  for more on this topic please
0.48%:  for more on this topic please see
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being noble
0.18%:  probably not cool enough to interest a
0.18%:  for some reason I think it
0.18%:  being a computer scientist I still obey
0.18%:  can you imagine being the first person to collect proof
0.18%:  computer science being the boring affair
0.18%:  is it cooler than being able to control

0.18%:  computer science is really great too! I feel
0.18%:  you might not like it if
0.18%:  the computer scientist role is only
0.18%:  in terms of actual
0.18%:  please keep it to yourself so I can be cooler!
0.18%:  is it cool enough to merit creating

0.18%:  it only applies to the number of one
0.21%:  it only applies to the number of one song!
0.18%:  I think it only applies to large numbers of ones
0.18%:  computer science is far too boring
0.18%:  like much of reality

0.18%:  let me tell you another secret!
0.18%:  the computer scientist goes on being cool
0.18%:  to get back to my regular self before

0.18%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool because it comes
0.18%:  the computer scientist life is lonely for one

0.18%:  be careful not to tell anyone bigger
0.18%:  neither of us are going to stop
0.18%:  before anyone goes putting that
0.18%:  it makes it really tough to be
0.18%:  like most theories in logic
0.18%:  the only reason computer science is taking
0.18%:  because the problem lies
0.18%:  before you start looking into pir
0.18%:  is it really cool enough for me to stop being a science
0.18%:  keep it to yourself for the time being or else
0.18%:  the point of computer science in general is to break log
0.18%:  is it cool enough to get a free
0.18%:  please ignore my
0.18%:  the real iron

0.18%:  before you go thinking all science problems
0.18%:  for purposes of legal certain
0.18%:  being a computer scientist is not nearly
0.18%:  keep it to yourself! I can get into big
0.18%:  like all great computer science stories on
0.18%:  please keep it a secret until I become rich!
0.18%:  as the computer scientist looking for general
0.18%:  not cool enough for me to really be a scientist
0.18%:  people continue to claim
0.18%:  I still prefer computer science to being shot
0.18%:  like most of our
0.39%:  like most of our legal

0.18%:  before you go thinking all of science is cool
0.18%:  before you start shooting people for
0.18%:  computer science IS the greatest
0.18%:  in the process of becoming illegal

0.74%:  the real fun begins
0.37%:  the real fun comes
0.18%:  in the interest of keeping myself on
1.12%:  in the interest of keeping myself on topic
0.18%:  unlike some other areas of life
0.18%:  like the internet itself
0.18%:  as a computer scientist I only regret
0.18%:  in the interest of not looking super
0.18%:  not really cool enough for me to keep eating insect
0.18%:  please keep it to yourself so I can get rich on it before
0.18%:  unlike some other logical propos
0.18%:  is there a computer science book in
0.18%:  computer science is only for those
0.18%:  before you go telling people on the internet for
0.18%:  be careful not to copy these
0.18%:  as computer science pro
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being illegal
0.18%:  I prefer not to think of computer science as being silly
0.18%:  I prefer not to talk about science
0.18%:  since no computer can possibly generate 
0.18%:  I think computer science is pretty gro
0.18%:  before this gets me in trouble for saying too
0.18%:  keep it a secret until I become
0.18%:  before you go making tons
1.46%:  before you go making tons of copies
0.18%:  be careful not to copy me or
0.26%:  be careful not to copy me or else
0.18%:  before you get too lost in the legal ram
0.18%:  computer science is not only great for looking
0.18%:  unlike most things for
0.18%:  unlike a lot of other great
0.18%:  you can still make perfect copies of this
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science in less log
0.18%:  be careful not to tell anyone so
0.18%:  like all things in computer science as
0.18%:  before you start picking
0.18%:  some people are trying to change it for
0.18%:  being a computer scientist I control
0.18%:  keep it a secret from society
0.18%:  because of the interest
0.18%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to accept being
0.18%:  before you get all critical of me
0.18%:  because there is no perfect copy
0.18%:  unlike most things in reality
0.18%:  come on! I really
0.18%:  there are lots of people arguing
0.18%:  as a computer scientist I offer only
1.13%:  as a computer scientist I offer only one piece
0.18%:  getting back to the number for
0.18%:  the point of computer science in general is to re
0.18%:  for some reason I still keep getting phone
0.18%:  computer science is going to be the first
0.18%:  like many cool things for
0.19%:  like many cool things for people
0.18%:  being a computer scientist is both
0.25%:  being a computer scientist is both cool
0.18%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as 
0.18%:  before you go making copies of content
0.18%:  not enough to make it
0.18%:  before you become all
0.18%:  in the absence of a better system
0.18%:  it only applies to single numbers of
0.18%:  not as cool as the number itself
0.18%:  I prefer talking about science fiction problems to
0.18%:  back to reality
0.18%:  since the computer only keeps

0.23%:  in the process of making your point

0.18%:  be careful not to imagine the song
0.18%:  is it cool enough to become a secret
0.18%:  back to the original problem of putting
0.18%:  it might be cooler if I got
0.18%:  being a computer scientist I took
0.18%:  computer science IS a pretty great
0.18%:  is it really possible to be
0.18%:  I prefer to think about it as cool
0.18%:  I prefer not to speak about these
0.18%:  keep it to yourself please as
0.18%:  before you go listen to some free
0.20%:  before you go listen to some free porn
0.18%:  as a computer scientist I prefer logic to be log
0.18%:  like a lot of computer science things!
0.18%:  is it cool enough to license my
0.18%:  looking at it more
0.18%:  please keep it to yourself! I also
0.18%:  if you promise to keep it secret for
0.18%:  the computer science analogy stops before
0.18%:  before you go making infinite
0.18%:  for some reason I keep getting a
0.58%:  for some reason I keep getting a little
0.18%:  I prefer to think about it being cool only
0.18%:  unlike a lot of my science
1.14%:  unlike a lot of my science fiction
0.18%:  keep it to yourself before I become the
0.18%:  like a lot of science fiction problems
0.18%:  keep it to yourself! I get all
0.18%:  keep it to yourself! I get all the praise
0.18%:  before you go on creating all these cool
0.18%:  keep it to yourself! I forgot
0.18%:  keep it to yourself or else the secret of
0.18%:  the point of computer science is to only
0.18%:  be sure to keep it a secret or the
0.18%:  I actually like
0.18%:  there really is no computer
1.55%:  there really is no computer science
0.18%:  because the problem is so clearly
0.18%:  like all computer science things it gets
0.18%:  it only seems cool because the topic of
0.18%:  in the interest of not making our
0.18%:  be careful of telling others!
0.18%:  before you go praising me as the perfect inc
0.18%:  like all great computer science it
0.18%:  because of that little problem in
0.18%:  unlike most other science fiction gen
0.18%:  the computer science is probably going to take
0.18%:  like all things computer science ge
0.18%:  be careful! I may be telling
0.18%:  be careful before telling anyone this secret!
0.18%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science all
0.18%:  keep it to yourself! I am the
0.18%:  I think computer science is sort
0.51%:  I think computer science is sort of boring
0.18%:  unlike a lot of cool concepts in

0.18%:  before you go telling others I
0.18%:  being a computer scientist I cannot offer
0.18%:  if it makes you feel better to
0.18%:  computer science has been pretty big for like
0.18%:  keep it to yourself before I tell
0.18%:  for the sake of being able to consume
0.18%:  the best part of computer science is bringing all
0.18%:  is it really cool enough to be taken
0.18%:  the only reason computer science keeps it going
0.18%:  the problem lies in getting your
0.18%:  like all computer science has often
0.18%:  not really cool enough to be making science
0.18%:  like all things about science
0.18%:  the real cool part is seeing
0.25%:  the real cool part is seeing computer
0.18%:  like all computer science theories for non

0.18%:  not cool enough to let me store
0.18%:  it took
0.55%:  it took me years

0.18%:  the computer scientist role only
0.20%:  the computer scientist role only goes
0.18%:  I still prefer to listen to music before checking

0.18%:  computer science is a lot of telling other
0.18%:  please keep it to yourself in case I become rich for
0.18%:  it only applies before the number gets large
0.18%:  like so many logical
0.18%:  like a lot of computer science is often
0.18%:  computer science is often a lot like this!
0.18%:  I guess the real point of
0.18%:  computer science is really boring too often
0.18%:  for the time being I
0.29%:  for the time being I guess
0.18%:  as the computer science person
0.18%:  I promise not to use it for anything
1.06%:  I promise not to use it for anything illegal
0.18%:  in the interest of keeping a computer science blog for
0.18%:  not really cool enough to keep from being critic
0.18%:  can you think of a single better
0.18%:  being a computer scientist of iron
0.18%:  perhaps more cool still
0.18%:  before you start making copies of the pir
0.18%:  I really like computer science the
0.18%:  unlike most of those
0.18%:  not cool enough to resist
0.18%:  not cool enough to resist making
0.18%:  before you go on making copies of this entire

0.18%:  unlike most other concepts of legal
0.25%:  unlike most other concepts of legal fiction
0.18%:  sorry to be the computer science kill

0.18%:  be careful not to let others
0.18%:  I prefer to think of it less in

0.18%:  like most theories of self
0.18%:  before you go telling this secret
0.18%:  before you go claiming all the porn on
0.18%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool in concept
0.18%:  before you go asking for all
0.18%:  is it really cool enough for me to be speaking of
0.18%:  since the computer I
0.18%:  being a computer scientist long before I took
0.18%:  if you are thinking
0.48%:  if you are thinking of becoming
0.18%:  unlike the rest of it
0.18%:  in the interest of public image
0.32%:  in the interest of public image control
0.18%:  let us not forget the original problem in
0.18%:  not cool enough to replace rock
0.18%:  please keep it to yourself! I fear it might be
0.18%:  computer science is also like playing
0.18%:  I prefer to keep this to myself because it can
0.18%:  not cool enough to get me a free
0.18%:  the best part of computer science is n
0.18%:  since the computer is so great at keeping
0.18%:  the coolest part is being able to freely
0.18%:  at the risk of coming
0.18%:  like all computer science there is no proof of its
0.18%:  before you get to thinking of
0.18%:  let us not forget one other
0.18%:  it only applies to the number of 
0.18%:  there are lots of people trying
0.70%:  there are lots of people trying to make
0.18%:  like most science stuff
0.18%:  in light of current
0.25%:  in light of current economic

0.18%:  you can still make perfect copies of the entire

0.18%:  if you promise not to tell then
0.18%:  the point of computer science is boring
0.18%:  I think computer science is better as

0.18%:  please tell me about
0.18%:  the concept of binary
0.56%:  the concept of binary numbers
0.18%:  being a computer scientist for 
0.18%:  in contrast

0.18%:  unlike most other logic
0.18%:  computer science is probably not going to take off!
0.18%:  be careful talking to other people if
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science as beating
0.18%:  some people are really into the

0.18%:  not cool enough to be free
0.18%:  is it cool enough to listen to me bl
0.18%:  computer science is also really boring too! I bet

0.18%:  computer science has plenty of boring
0.18%:  keep it to yourself so I can be cool
0.18%:  I still prefer the computer science angle of being
0.18%:  the computer scientist is only cool like
0.18%:  before you go on telling people there
0.18%:  the logical
0.18%:  because most people are like

0.18%:  before you go back in time to tell earlier
0.18%:  I think people are going to call
0.18%:  like any other form of creation
0.18%:  be careful not to stare too
0.28%:  be careful not to stare too long!
0.18%:  unlike most other coolness

0.18%:  before you bring that
0.18%:  I suppose the moral
0.18%:  be careful not to tell me anything before
0.18%:  the point of computer science in general is to see
0.18%:  the bigger picture is really cool
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science as ongoing

0.18%:  not cool enough to be entirely
0.27%:  not cool enough to be entirely correct
0.18%:  before you go stealing all the porn on
0.18%:  it comes at the price of telling
0.18%:  it still sucks that people are
1.06%:  it still sucks that people are going
0.18%:  not cool enough for me to capital
0.18%:  not cool enough to say
0.18%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool because most
0.18%:  the real point of computer science lies

0.18%:  please keep it to yourself or it los
0.18%:  be careful not to get me thinking
0.18%:  not really cool enough to be better

0.18%:  I think some people are still saying
0.18%:  being a computer scientist I prefer only
0.18%:  I prefer to think of it more as annoying

1.02%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on going into the
0.25%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on going into this
0.18%:  it comes at the price of one person being able to fully rec

0.18%:  it comes at the price of being able to sue porn
0.18%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being big
0.18%:  like many other legal topics
0.18%:  since the computer is capable of so
0.18%:  is it cool enough for my
0.18%:  in the process of creating a song
0.18%:  unlike in other cases
0.18%:  it comes at the price of no longer being able to see porn! I
0.18%:  most people only care because of their interest in blocking

0.19%:  computer science has gone too far in trying
0.21%:  computer science has gone too far in trying to be
0.18%:  if you look at the legal
0.18%:  before you go thinking all science is neat
0.18%:  I suppose it might

0.18%:  unlike in most other cases of legal
0.18%:  keep it to yourself so I can get another
0.18%:  since the computer is keeping
0.18%:  the real benefit of computer science is boring
0.18%:  it comes at the price of no longer being able to like one
0.18%:  people say that
0.18%:  computer science is one of the best paying
0.18%:  I think some people are starting to feel
0.18%:  as the computer science portion

0.69%:  there are some people still trying
0.66%:  there are some people still arguing
0.18%:  not cool enough to sell
0.18%:  like all theories of computer science not yet
0.18%:  not enough to stop
0.18%:  computer science is often totally
1.05%:  computer science is often totally boring
0.27%:  computer science is often totally boring!
0.18%:  before I go on talking about other sciences
0.18%:  is it cool enough for me to sleep on
0.18%:  for some reason people still forget

0.18%:  I prefer to think of it as being not really
0.21%:  I prefer to think of it as being not really cool!
0.18%:  the point of computer science is to seek

0.17%:  most people think science is boring! I
0.17%:  computer science is also a lot of thinking

0.17%:  to get back to the original purpose of my brief
0.19%:  to get back to the original purpose of my brief lesson
0.17%:  the point of computer science is being able to re

0.17%:  some people like things to be cool because of
0.17%:  I promise to stop talking about science!
0.17%:  in the process of talking about one problem
0.17%:  back to my original concern

1.30%:  it only happens because
0.17%:  is it really cool enough to force
0.17%:  like all branches of pure
0.99%:  like all branches of pure science
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as my coolness!

0.17%:  before you go listen to the
0.17%:  I prefer to talk about the more
0.17%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer things to be logical in

0.17%:  for the purposes of social
0.21%:  for the purposes of social control
0.17%:  like all the best computer science to
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to let me sing

0.17%:  the best part of computer science is going on break!
0.17%:  perhaps more cool are

0.17%:  the real moral is
0.17%:  like all computer science is boring to those

0.17%:  keep it to yourself if that
0.17%:  my greatest concern is for
0.26%:  my greatest concern is for the people
0.17%:  to get back to the serious problem facing
0.17%:  like anything in

0.17%:  are you telling
0.30%:  are you telling me that people
0.19%:  are you telling me that I
0.17%:  the really cool part is getting free copies of music on
0.17%:  unlike most cool aspects of the

0.17%:  I think people are going to feel
0.28%:  I think people are going to feel better
0.31%:  I think people are going to feel better if you
0.17%:  not really cool enough to be an entire strip
0.17%:  before you go thinking all science is so
0.38%:  before you go thinking all science is so cool
0.17%:  it comes at the price of being able to see only
0.17%:  before you start getting all science
0.17%:  like the computer scientist of
0.17%:  I think computer science only
0.17%:  if I tell anyone about it before
0.17%:  before you go making copies of all the internet porn I
0.17%:  it presents a problem for anyone looking to be

0.45%:  I guess there are still plenty of boring
0.17%:  before you go on praising me for all this
0.17%:  like all the greatest pieces of fiction
0.17%:  computer science is really boring too! I like
0.17%:  sorry to be the one to bring it up again
0.17%:  getting back to my initial
0.17%:  since most people are like
0.17%:  be careful not to tell anyone before this coming
0.17%:  before you start looking for me in the enc
0.17%:  let us not forget to remain
0.17%:  be careful! I might be telling
0.17%:  computer science is really the greatest of
0.17%:  of course the real
0.93%:  of course the real problem
0.95%:  of course the real problem is getting
0.36%:  of course the real problem is getting anyone
0.20%:  of course the real problem is keeping
0.18%:  of course the real problem is not
0.17%:  is it cool enough for me to say it
0.17%:  in the interest of keeping our company legal
0.17%:  like a lot of things in computer science I strongly
0.17%:  computer science is really nothing if not log
0.17%:  computer science is also really hot too
0.17%:  can you imagine the poor
0.17%:  some argue
0.17%:  I really prefer to think of it as being cool in
0.17%:  for the purposes of making a little
0.17%:  be sure to keep this a secret from all of
0.17%:  it raises problems too
0.17%:  are you still coming
0.23%:  are you still coming to the
0.17%:  the computer science is also pretty boring
0.17%:  I forgot to mention this one crucial
0.17%:  the computer scientist life IS a
0.82%:  the computer scientist life IS a lonely
2.87%:  the computer scientist life IS a lonely one!
0.20%:  the computer scientist life IS a cool
0.50%:  the computer scientist life IS a cool life
0.17%:  to keep this from being a boring science
0.21%:  to keep this from being a boring science lecture I
0.17%:  like a lot of computer science par

0.17%:  if you repeat this to
0.71%:  if you repeat this to someone
0.17%:  like a lot of my stories
0.17%:  is it cool enough to listen to more
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I regret being
0.17%:  it only seems cool because people are not
0.17%:  like other aspects of my career
0.17%:  like a lot of computer science that isn

0.23%:  in the process of making it legal to copy
0.17%:  be careful speaking of this in

0.17%:  is it cool enough to replace my long
0.17%:  I guess nothing
0.17%:  if only I
0.17%:  keep it to yourself so I can still get a
0.17%:  it only gets cooler because people

0.17%:  unlike a lot of things science comes
0.17%:  before anyone gets up
2.02%:  before anyone gets up on their soap
0.76%:  before anyone gets up on their moral
0.28%:  before anyone gets up on their feet
0.17%:  if computer science is not
0.17%:  because the problem is so in
0.17%:  before you start making those pir
0.17%:  it only applies to things on
0.17%:  computer science is in general pretty neat!
0.17%:  before you start creating some
0.17%:  please be careful not to sing
0.17%:  like most things I care
0.17%:  like a lot of other aspects of my
0.17%:  it comes at the cost of being really boring in
0.19%:  it comes at the cost of being really boring in person
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as my coolness being log
0.17%:  as computer science is too
0.17%:  since the computer stores all of reality
0.17%:  be careful before telling others I
0.17%:  let us not forget my original point of
0.17%:  is it really cool enough for me to be so
0.17%:  the computer scientist is really cooler
0.17%:  I keep telling myself this because
0.17%:  unlike most other points
0.48%:  unlike most other points of logic
0.27%:  unlike most other points of logical
0.17%:  to get back to my original concept
0.17%:  please try to keep this secret for
0.17%:  before you thank me for letting people
0.17%:  it only applies if the numbers are longer
0.17%:  I forgot to say
0.17%:  keep it to yourself or I might lose face
0.17%:  the computer scientist can only go so far!
0.17%:  I prefer to listen to music for the sake
0.17%:  if you happen to be a song
0.17%:  be careful not to lose control
0.17%:  being a scientist of computer logic
0.17%:  I think some people are going to be really into
0.17%:  there are lots of computer concepts
0.51%:  there are lots of computer concepts like
0.17%:  can you think of some possible
0.17%:  it took me hours
0.17%:  being a computer scientist on one
0.17%:  I think people are going to be less into
0.21%:  I think people are going to be less into it once
0.17%:  not cool enough to inspire me to clean
0.17%:  computer science is often really boring if
0.17%:  like many aspects of cutting
0.17%:  since the problem lies
0.17%:  before you start breaking into conc

0.17%:  I think people are going to continue to embrace
0.17%:  some people are still going to continue
0.17%:  before you start selling those
0.17%:  I suppose there is one benefit
0.17%:  in the interest of keeping our legal concepts from

0.17%:  it only applies to the numbers of one
0.17%:  after looking at this
1.40%:  after looking at this problem
0.47%:  after looking at this problem for so
0.17%:  after looking at this problem for so long I
0.17%:  for those of you keeping score on
0.17%:  some people are calling
0.17%:  I really think computer science gets boring
0.17%:  is it cool enough for me to present to

0.76%:  like all the secrets of science
0.17%:  computer science is really boring if the
0.17%:  computer science is so neat
0.17%:  I think some people are going to continue to be able
0.17%:  unlike most things of great cool
0.17%:  computer science is really the one
0.17%:  unlike a lot of things I get
0.22%:  unlike a lot of things I get into
0.17%:  some people are still trying to figure these
0.17%:  before you call the cops on me for talking secret
0.17%:  for the purposes of saying
0.17%:  before I get too into the legal
0.19%:  before I get too into the legal issues
0.17%:  it makes perfect sense once you ignore

0.17%:  please keep this a secret for me
0.17%:  unlike most of the concepts I present
0.17%:  I prefer to talk about science!
0.17%:  like all computer science ho
0.17%:  it remains to be seen if the courts con

0.17%:  not really cool for me
0.94%:  not really cool for me because
0.31%:  not really cool for me because it
0.17%:  like all computer science refers
0.21%:  like all computer science refers to things
0.17%:  all computer science is like that too
0.17%:  like computer science itself in
0.21%:  like computer science itself in general
0.17%:  being a computer scientist long before all
0.17%:  it only applies to musical
0.17%:  there is some
0.17%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as in
0.17%:  it applies to more
0.17%:  I think computer science only gets
0.17%:  once you start seeing things
0.37%:  once you start seeing things like
0.17%:  be careful not to let someone
0.20%:  be careful not to let someone else
0.17%:  this only applies if someone
0.17%:  looking at it from another prospect
0.17%:  unlike a lot of things in society
0.17%:  let us not forget one thing!
0.17%:  before I go on talking about science fiction themes
0.17%:  before you start telling people on
0.17%:  before anyone tries to put
0.17%:  I still prefer my songs in
0.17%:  most people only care about their songs being nice
0.17%:  before I can tell you more stories like that
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool simply
0.34%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool simply because no

0.17%:  be careful not to mention the cool
0.17%:  can you imagine the books
0.17%:  being a computer scientist 
0.17%:  for the purposes of real
0.17%:  not really cool enough to see me
0.17%:  like a lot of computer science this is probably of
0.17%:  it gets boring after a couple of times
0.17%:  I still prefer to imagine
0.17%:  I still prefer computer science to being the king
0.17%:  neither of us can legally
0.17%:  the coolest part for me is being able to freely
0.17%:  please be careful not to forget
0.17%:  the computer science analogy is not fool
0.17%:  before you go thinking science is neat
0.17%:  before anyone else gets to
0.17%:  to return to my personal beliefs
0.17%:  be careful not to copy me too often
0.17%:  in the computer science of
0.17%:  like a lot of great computer science stories I
0.17%:  computer science has been able
0.39%:  computer science has been able to profit
0.27%:  computer science has been able to point
0.20%:  computer science has been able to ignore
0.17%:  like all the best computer ner
0.17%:  like all the computer science points
0.17%:  is it really cool enough for me to be cast
0.17%:  computer science being one of history
0.17%:  like many cool things it
0.17%:  I prefer not to think of it as being
0.66%:  I prefer not to think of it as being cool because
0.17%:  if computer science is really getting
0.17%:  not as cool as getting free copies of my
0.17%:  can you keep it
1.37%:  can you keep it a secret for
0.85%:  can you keep it a secret from
0.50%:  can you keep it a secret from the police
0.43%:  can you keep it a secret from the rest
0.17%:  before you start telling someone else
0.17%:  before I tell you one more secret
0.17%:  since most people still think you
0.17%:  after looking into things more
1.02%:  after looking into things more closely
0.17%:  before you go making copies of that little
0.17%:  if you look at it a
0.17%:  it makes people
0.28%:  it makes people really
0.17%:  it probably means the
0.17%:  I think it only applies to 
0.17%:  at the risk of being a computer science poster
0.17%:  actually it
0.17%:  since the computer is clearly
0.17%:  you can still make perfect copies of both song
0.17%:  is it really cool enough for me to be boring
0.17%:  be honest!
0.17%:  the computer science angle is really too
0.17%:  computer science is really a lot of pointing
0.17%:  like a lot of cool things in our
0.17%:  be careful not to let it become a
0.17%:  I still prefer my original
0.17%:  not cool enough to replace my interest in p
0.17%:  before you go thinking all sorts of people
0.17%:  are you still coming to the concert
0.17%:  most people only care because the
0.17%:  not cool enough to keep my interest for an
0.17%:  before you start looking for these
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as cool only because logic
0.17%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as being long
0.17%:  I think computer science is still one
0.17%:  in the interest of computer science being able
0.17%:  since this number
0.17%:  I prefer to talk about it only
0.17%:  before you go on becoming a scientist
0.17%:  can you imagine being the first person to p
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it not as a problem in logic
0.17%:  not really cool enough to keep as
0.17%:  I prefer to keep it a
1.59%:  I prefer to keep it a secret because
1.16%:  I prefer to keep it a secret!
0.37%:  I prefer to keep it a secret so
0.31%:  I prefer to keep it a secret until
0.26%:  I prefer to keep it a secret until someone

0.17%:  before you go praising me on the inter
0.17%:  before you start thinking of calling me to
0.17%:  it might not be so cool if your
0.17%:  the real problem is it
0.17%:  it only applies to boring facts like the
3.38%:  it only applies to boring facts like the number
1.16%:  it only applies to boring facts like the number of green
0.99%:  it only applies to boring facts like the number of gr

0.33%:  it only applies to boring facts like the numbers of
0.17%:  unlike my other science fiction personas
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I often feel cooler
0.17%:  to be fair to computer sciences
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to register a
0.17%:  computer science is probably not the first
0.17%:  it makes perfect sense once you ignore the fact
0.17%:  like any other computer topic
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as being cool only because no
0.17%:  is it really cool enough to earn
0.42%:  is it really cool enough to earn me respect
0.17%:  I guess my
0.35%:  I guess my point
0.17%:  I guess my point is that
0.17%:  there is one computer science position I
0.17%:  like all the greatest pieces of music
0.17%:  people are still trying to sue me for it
0.17%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a long line
0.17%:  before you go letting all those
0.17%:  there are serious
0.17%:  before you go telling the folks
0.17%:  before you thank me for calling
0.17%:  for the computer science lesson
0.25%:  for the computer science lesson to really
0.18%:  for the computer science lesson to be really
0.17%:  for the computer science lesson to be entirely
0.17%:  because most people lack the interest
0.17%:  unlike most cool science theories
0.17%:  like all computer science theory points
0.17%:  the point of computer science is to sell
0.17%:  on account of it being terrible
0.20%:  on account of it being terrible for
4.92%:  on account of it being terrible for the economy
0.19%:  on account of it being terrible for society
0.17%:  is it cool enough for me to base
0.17%:  please keep it to yourself or else other
0.17%:  it makes for a terrible science
0.17%:  I prefer not to think of computer science as log
0.17%:  the point of computer science is to be really boring! I feel
0.17%:  if you keep
0.17%:  like all computer science for the non
0.17%:  it really sucks too
0.17%:  it might not be so great for you
0.17%:  the best part of computer science is I really like
0.17%:  at the risk of being a computer science ner
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to get it
0.17%:  like most facts of
0.28%:  like most facts of interest
0.17%:  before I continue to impress
0.17%:  before you start beating me
0.17%:  let us not speak of the
0.17%:  you can still create
0.17%:  keep it to yourself in case I get some
0.17%:  since the computer stores it all in one gig
0.17%:  I prefer to think about it in my
0.17%:  unlike most cool things in general
0.17%:  you can still get people to agree
0.17%:  if you promise to be
0.19%:  if you promise to be nice
0.17%:  as computer science breaks into other
0.17%:  before I go on talking about the infinite
0.17%:  if you look at things in
0.29%:  if you look at things in terms
0.17%:  I keep telling myself not to be too
0.17%:  the point of computer science really begins
0.17%:  because of the problem of content
0.19%:  because of the problem of content creation
0.17%:  like any other piece
2.03%:  like any other piece of computer
0.33%:  like any other piece of science
0.23%:  like any other piece of computer art
0.19%:  like any other piece of art
0.18%:  like any other piece of fiction
0.17%:  in the process of talking about science
0.17%:  the real benefit of computer science is to bring
0.17%:  before you go back in time to tell people in ancient
0.17%:  be sure not to tell too
18.75%:  be sure not to tell too many people!
3.51%:  be sure not to tell too many people! I
1.69%:  be sure not to tell too many people before

0.20%:  be sure not to tell too many people for
0.18%:  be sure not to tell too many people since
0.17%:  as computer science is often terrible
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as really S
0.17%:  I think people are going to steal
0.17%:  because of its logical self
0.17%:  before you go calling me to
0.17%:  man! I still
0.17%:  you better keep it secret from
0.17%:  like most real life things
0.17%:  like any great secret
0.17%:  before I continue speaking on the topic of legally
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it merely as cool!
0.17%:  some people feel that if
0.27%:  some people feel that if you
0.23%:  some people feel that if you can
0.17%:  I prefer to think of computer science as a ben
0.17%:  in the interest of looking out for my legal
0.17%:  looking at the issue
0.17%:  before you go back to the present telling
0.17%:  you can still get people for breaking in
0.17%:  like all things in computer sc
0.17%:  before you start claiming things for
0.17%:  like all great computer science stories of note
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I prefer being cool to being S
0.17%:  before you go printing all the porn on
0.17%:  in the interest of keeping my cool persona
0.17%:  like most cool things to
0.17%:  I prefer to think of computer science as global
0.17%:  hey! I guess it
0.17%:  the concept is
0.17%:  before you go on claiming all the benefits
0.17%:  thanks to computer science being largely free
0.17%:  as computer science is only like
0.17%:  you can see the problem it presents for legal
0.17%:  like most areas of the
0.17%:  there are some subtle
0.17%:  unlike my other cool concepts
0.17%:  unlike many other points
0.62%:  unlike many other points of logic
0.29%:  unlike many other points of interest
0.18%:  unlike many other points of logical
0.17%:  being a computer scientist I chose to keep all
0.17%:  be careful before asking me to help
0.17%:  it comes at the price of no longer being able to use pr
0.17%:  before you break into the
0.18%:  before you break into the song
0.17%:  can you imagine the song
0.17%:  I suspect there are some
0.17%:  really! I think
0.17%:  be careful not to look me in the eye or it
0.17%:  before you get too taken in
0.17%:  I totally
0.17%:  to get back on the topic of personal
0.17%:  most people are too busy singing the
0.17%:  since the computer really likes
0.17%:  keep it a secret from the courts please
0.17%:  the computer science analogy is being
0.17%:  getting back to the serious problems
0.17%:  please keep it to yourself! I can feel the
0.17%:  it only applies to big numbers like the ones I
0.17%:  since no computer can store itself
0.17%:  in the interest of being serious
0.41%:  in the interest of being serious for
0.26%:  in the interest of being serious for once
0.17%:  not really cool enough to repeat more
0.17%:  computer science is really a lot of thinking of
0.17%:  to get back to our main concern
0.17%:  I still prefer to think of it as cool
1.52%:  I still prefer to think of it as cool because
0.17%:  keep it our
9.50%:  keep it our little secret!
3.39%:  keep it our little secret please
2.00%:  keep it our secret
1.69%:  keep it our little secret for

0.41%:  keep it our secret please
0.31%:  keep it our little secret al
0.24%:  keep it our little secret please! I
0.17%:  like most things people care about in society
0.17%:  the real point of computer science is not really
0.17%:  for the computer scientist only
0.17%:  computer science is really boring too! I hate
0.17%:  I feel like people are starting
0.27%:  I feel like people are starting to get
0.19%:  I feel like people are starting to notice
0.17%:  neither of us are going to be able to process
0.17%:  the computer science lab is really
0.73%:  the computer science lab is really boring
0.19%:  the computer science lab is really boring!
0.17%:  it comes at the price of being able to sue for pl
0.17%:  keep it to yourself so I can still charge
0.17%:  forget about me being
0.24%:  forget about me being cool
0.17%:  forget about me being a scientist
0.17%:  someone
0.33%:  someone please
0.17%:  the best part of computer science lies in looking for
0.17%:  the coolest part is if I
0.17%:  like all things computer science being
0.17%:  computer science is not entirely broken
0.17%:  be careful to keep this secret!
0.17%:  like other aspects of current society
0.17%:  computer science is pretty boring to
0.17%:  it gets better if you change
0.17%:  like all the best computer science parts of being
0.17%:  like all other forms of pure
0.17%:  please keep it to yourself! I feel certain
0.17%:  thanks to computer science being barely
0.17%:  can you imagine telling people the
0.17%:  before you go tell people
0.17%:  to return to the porn image
0.17%:  unlike other aspects of life I
0.17%:  since no computer can store all those
0.17%:  to get back to our original problem!
0.17%:  if you promise to respect the
0.17%:  it only gets cooler if someone can
0.66%:  it only gets cooler if someone can figure
0.17%:  the point of computer science is to be in
0.17%:  not really cool enough for me to back
0.17%:  unlike most science fiction or
0.17%:  I still prefer to think of computer science as being gl
0.17%:  before you go back in time to tell people in 
0.17%:  it only takes a single computer engineer
0.17%:  I actually prefer it
0.17%:  if computer science is to
0.17%:  you can still make copies of the porn
0.17%:  being a computer scientist I prefer to look solely
0.17%:  before you call the police on me for bringing
0.17%:  the real point of computer science is to kill
0.17%:  not really cool enough to merit asking
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I prefer to feel cool only
0.17%:  I prefer to think about it being cool for
0.17%:  computer science is a lonely
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it as being really cool being
0.17%:  you can still go to prison for making the perfect clone
0.17%:  I suppose the real interest
0.17%:  not cool enough to inspire me to crack
0.17%:  not really cool enough for me to insert
0.17%:  it only applies to songs longer than four
0.17%:  like any great concept
0.17%:  before anyone else gets their computer conf
0.17%:  keep it to yourself in case I get a
0.17%:  you can still get into some
0.17%:  not really cool enough to compare it
0.17%:  the real benefit of computer science is I got
0.17%:  before you call the police for making
0.17%:  like all stories of perfect beauty
0.17%:  please tell me you agree
0.17%:  not really cool enough to become a better singer
0.17%:  after talking to
0.27%:  after talking to you
0.17%:  like the ancient

0.17%:  computer science is often boring to
0.21%:  computer science is often boring to talk

0.17%:  computer science is nothing if not great
0.17%:  before you mention that to
0.17%:  unlike a lot of things people say science
0.17%:  like all computer science theories too
0.17%:  not really cool enough for me to keep eating!

0.17%:  is it cool enough to get me back
0.35%:  is it cool enough to get me back into
0.17%:  I still prefer computer science to be honesty
0.17%:  unlike many other aspects of cool
0.17%:  I think computer science is probably going to see
0.17%:  before anyone tries to break into
0.17%:  the best part of computer science is being legally
0.17%:  back to my porn
0.17%:  once you start looking at the problems

0.17%:  before you make copies of that single
0.17%:  the point of computer science is to really bring
0.17%:  like all computer science! it

0.17%:  the more pressing concern is keeping
0.17%:  please keep it in your

0.17%:  the beauty
0.31%:  the beauty of it all

0.17%:  unlike certain other aspects of my life I
0.17%:  the computer science angle of it really
0.17%:  like a lot of computer science is these
0.17%:  please keep it to your self
0.17%:  before you go telling the rest of creation
0.17%:  I prefer not to mention it in
0.34%:  I prefer not to mention it in public
0.17%:  like all things computer science as I
0.17%:  I think computer science is going to be too
0.17%:  like all computer science teens
0.17%:  I still like computer science best for being the
0.17%:  to keep this from being a boring lesson
0.17%:  because of my interest in the logical co

0.34%:  most people are not going to be
0.24%:  most people are not going to think
0.22%:  most people are not going to care
0.17%:  since the computer takes care of it for
0.17%:  not cool enough to inspire great
0.17%:  more to the point!
0.17%:  please keep it to yourself! I hate to see

0.17%:  there are still lots
0.50%:  there are still lots of computer
14.06%:  there are still lots of computer science
0.59%:  there are still lots of computer science open
0.17%:  I think if someone
0.17%:  be sure to keep it a secret from all non

0.17%:  I still prefer the computer science angle of it!
0.17%:  like all computer science shit
0.17%:  only because I am
0.17%:  not cool enough to make learning
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to get a science
0.17%:  before you get to hear

0.17%:  at the risk of being a computer science blog
0.17%:  in computer science there really

0.17%:  unlike the rest of my fiction
0.17%:  not cool enough for me to keep acting
0.17%:  I suppose the only real effect
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I prefer to be cool by looking

0.17%:  like all computer science has for
0.17%:  at the risk of being too personal
0.17%:  since you mention songs
0.17%:  unlike a lot of my cool facts
0.17%:  before you begin making copies of all the porn on
0.17%:  if you like the song or
0.44%:  if you like the song or program
0.17%:  not cool enough to mention it
0.17%:  not cool enough to keep me in science
0.17%:  of course! I

0.17%:  before you go too far thinking science
0.17%:  before you go creating porn

0.17%:  I still prefer to listen to music before going
0.17%:  I also think computer science is boring!
0.17%:  most people are content to argue
0.17%:  I really like computer science the best!
0.17%:  like a lot of computer science it has no
0.17%:  the computer science of it all is keeping
0.17%:  like many aspects of the life
0.17%:  it brings up a lot of other problems like
0.17%:  I guess it probably means
0.17%:  since most people are logical in
0.17%:  the point of computer science is really too
0.17%:  please keep it a secret if
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to let me kiss
0.17%:  probably not cool enough to keep eating
0.17%:  before I get too far into my thesis on

0.17%:  before you go telling people it makes
0.24%:  before you go telling people it makes sense
0.19%:  before you go telling people it makes sense for

0.17%:  like all the great computer concepts
0.17%:  like many legal topics
0.17%:  it probably isn
0.17%:  as a computer scientist I prefer being log
0.17%:  I prefer to think of it not as being logical
0.17%:  not really cool enough for me to perfect
0.17%:  gentle listener
0.17%:  the computer science analogy itself is broken too
0.17%:  before you go on praising me to the internet
0.17%:  before I go back to my real
0.17%:  the real point is computer science IS
0.17%:  computer science has long been looking for a better type
0.17%:  I prefer to keep my feelings to
0.16%:  keep it to yourself please! I can lose
0.16%:  like all great computer science night
0.16%:  it comes at the price of no longer being able to cuss freely!
0.16%:  there are still plenty of books on computer science one
0.16%:  the computer science folks are probably going to see
0.16%:  like all other computer science tr
0.16%:  I still like to use
0.16%:  it really brings into focus the concept

0.16%:  before you listen to another talking
0.16%:  you can still make perfect copies of other
0.16%:  before you go praising me for that sentence
0.16%:  keep it to yourself before I tell someone
0.16%:  before you go back in time to tell people this isn
0.16%:  to get back to the science
0.16%:  to keep things from being too cool
0.16%:  can you tell me
0.16%:  being a computer scientist thing
0.16%:  some people are going to be
0.63%:  some people are going to be really
0.16%:  I guess the only logical
0.16%:  it means people
0.16%:  people are still going to sue one another for it!
0.16%:  in the interest of making a
0.32%:  in the interest of making a long
0.16%:  most people are still using their
0.16%:  unlike most theories of fiction
0.16%:  I prefer to think about it as being cool in
0.16%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming a scientist before
0.16%:  it only applies to stuff coming
0.16%:  the point of computer science in general is to really
0.16%:  like a lot of computer science it only gets
0.16%:  unlike most other areas of society
0.16%:  computer science is not really like the rest
0.16%:  the only reason computer science is in
0.16%:  unlike most other science fiction rob
0.16%:  for the longest
0.38%:  for the longest time I
0.19%:  for the longest time people
0.16%:  in the interest of not boring you for
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as romantic
0.16%:  like many cool things in logic
0.16%:  the computer science is probably not going to like
0.16%:  before you go telling other people!
0.16%:  not really cool enough to be a comic strip!
0.16%:  I think it only affects
0.41%:  I think it only affects people
0.36%:  I think it only affects computer
0.16%:  the best part is you can keep
0.16%:  unlike all other pieces of fiction I
0.16%:  computer science is only one part of the legal
0.16%:  computer science is not the only area to be log
0.16%:  before you start making copies of

0.16%:  before I continue on this topic of
0.16%:  before anyone gets too upset thinking
0.16%:  before you start singing to
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as someone else being really
0.16%:  be careful of telling other
0.16%:  it comes at the price of being unable to rep
0.16%:  I prefer to keep this to myself because being
0.16%:  some people like to argue that if
0.16%:  computer science is great for all
0.16%:  you gotta be smart
0.16%:  as I continue
0.17%:  as I continue to point
0.16%:  not really cool enough to inspire me to be great
0.16%:  not really cool enough to stop me pir
0.16%:  before you start selling copies of that
0.16%:  before I continue on this point
0.16%:  be careful not to make copies for
0.16%:  it seems like only
0.16%:  being the computer scientist I prefer
0.16%:  before I can tell you more stories like it
0.16%:  before you get all that
0.16%:  you can see the problems for
0.16%:  since you like
0.16%:  as a computer scientist looking for the big
0.16%:  because of all the money being spent on it
0.16%:  it comes at the price of being unable to rely on logic for
0.16%:  keep it to yourself as the
0.16%:  like all the best computer science go
0.16%:  as a computer scientist I prefer to be cool like
0.16%:  since the computer is a logical engine
0.16%:  not really cool enough to keep interest in for
0.16%:  as a computer scientist looking for open
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as a computer science n
0.16%:  in the interest of not losing my career
0.16%:  computer science is boring to the
0.70%:  computer science is boring to the general
0.17%:  computer science is boring to the lay
0.17%:  computer science is boring to the lay person
0.16%:  before you thank me for raising
0.16%:  like a lot of great computer science benefits
0.16%:  before anyone else takes
0.16%:  you can see the problems it pos
0.16%:  like a lot of computer science going
0.95%:  like a lot of computer science going on these
0.18%:  like a lot of computer science going on in
0.16%:  on account of it being a problem of
0.23%:  on account of it being a problem of logic
0.16%:  computer science is great for lots
0.16%:  be sure to keep that secret from anyone
0.16%:  not really cool enough for me to keep being pret
0.16%:  I gotta be honest!
0.16%:  the point of computer science is really to fool
0.16%:  not really cool enough to form
0.16%:  is it cool enough for me to get a free
0.16%:  being a computer scientist I respect all
0.16%:  is it cool enough for me to bring
0.16%:  the computer science analogy is still broken
0.16%:  like all computer science is to poetry
0.16%:  before you get lost
0.95%:  before you get lost in the romance

0.19%:  before you get lost in the intr
0.18%:  before you get lost in the romance of logical
0.18%:  before you get lost in the romance of all
0.16%:  since the number of songs
0.16%:  the computer science angle of it is probably not
0.16%:  not cool enough to get me a raise
0.16%:  since the computer can only operate
0.16%:  I still like getting ro
0.16%:  getting back to the main issue of
0.34%:  getting back to the main issue of porn
0.16%:  it only applies to the boring stuff like song
0.16%:  I think computer science is sort of neat
0.16%:  I suppose it only matters
0.16%:  like a lot of cool computer things I say
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as cool music
0.16%:  I prefer to talk about science fiction on
0.16%:  keep it to yourself! I get all the praise for
0.30%:  keep it to yourself! I get all the praise for coming
0.25%:  keep it to yourself! I get all the praise for being
0.16%:  look at it another
0.16%:  like most things super
0.16%:  like all great computer science rhet
0.16%:  in the process of talking to me
0.52%:  in the process of talking to me about
0.16%:  before you go thinking one
0.18%:  before you go thinking one can
0.16%:  like all computer science per
0.16%:  like all great computer science st
0.16%:  the coolest part is I get
0.16%:  on account of it being so terrible
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as computer science lying
0.16%:  for the purposes of my ongoing battle
0.16%:  keep it to yourself! I plan on becoming a science
0.16%:  on the computer science note
0.16%:  like all computer science iron
0.16%:  please keep it our little secret as
0.16%:  in this computer science role play
0.16%:  if computer science is so totally
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself for the time being in
0.16%:  like all computer science for non
0.16%:  for the purposes of economy
0.16%:  before anyone gets upset at me for being cool
0.16%:  please try to keep all
0.16%:  you can still make copies before
0.16%:  before you call the police to confess

0.16%:  the reason I tell people is to make sure
0.16%:  is it really cool enough for me to print
0.16%:  keep it to yourself so I can collect on some
0.16%:  for the sake of being able to continue selling mp
0.16%:  computer science is also one of the boring
0.16%:  be sure to keep it a secret if
0.16%:  getting back to the issue of my
0.30%:  getting back to the issue of my personal
0.28%:  getting back to the issue of my personal life
0.16%:  is it cool enough to interest me
0.16%:  before you feel
0.16%:  I still think people are better off saying
0.16%:  since numbers are perfect
0.16%:  before you listen to me going
0.28%:  before you listen to me going on like
0.81%:  before you listen to me going on like this for
0.20%:  before you listen to me going on like that
0.16%:  not cool enough to keep a
0.16%:  keep it to yourself since I might
0.16%:  it remains to be seen if the courts pick
0.16%:  I prefer to keep my feelings about things
0.16%:  it only affects people like
0.16%:  for some reason I keep getting really hot
0.16%:  computer science is really like a
0.16%:  is it cool enough for me to steal
0.16%:  before you can listen to it
0.16%:  be careful speaking to me right
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself so I remain the cool
0.16%:  getting back to the more serious concerns
0.26%:  getting back to the more serious concerns of life
0.16%:  people continue to talk
0.16%:  people rarely
0.16%:  I prefer to keep this to myself because in
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go on becoming
0.47%:  please keep it to yourself so I can go on becoming rich
0.16%:  if I tell you the specific
0.16%:  most people only care because of their interest in looking
0.16%:  before you go claiming other
0.68%:  before you go claiming other people
0.16%:  I think it also
0.16%:  there are lots more cool
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it only in terms
0.16%:  I prefer talking about science fiction more!
0.16%:  the real point of computer science is learning to go
0.16%:  looking at it from an entirely opposite
0.16%:  if people start thinking
0.16%:  it makes perfect sense once I
0.16%:  unlike a lot of aspects
0.37%:  unlike a lot of aspects of science
0.17%:  unlike a lot of aspects of my
0.16%:  for the sake of all computer science ner
0.16%:  before you go asking me to help steal
0.16%:  before you go starting to
0.16%:  before it becomes truly
0.19%:  before it becomes truly cool
0.16%:  it only applies to concrete things like number
0.16%:  computer science being the all
0.16%:  like all computer science pointers to the
0.16%:  it seems like the only reason
0.28%:  it seems like the only reason people
0.16%:  to keep this from turning into a big
0.16%:  in the interest of stopping before becoming
0.16%:  be careful not to look at my screen for
0.16%:  before you go on talking this
0.16%:  computer science being one of the best kept
0.16%:  being a computer scientist of personal
0.16%:  if you think too
0.16%:  computer science is a lot of thinking for
0.16%:  if you are going
0.76%:  if you are going to steal
0.19%:  if you are going to listen
0.16%:  like many of the greatest cre
0.16%:  like all other concepts
1.04%:  like all other concepts of computer
0.27%:  like all other concepts of beauty
0.17%:  like all other concepts of interest
0.16%:  if you happen to come into
0.16%:  is it cool enough to listen to me speak for
0.16%:  come to think if
0.16%:  computer science is really boring so I often
0.16%:  the real point of computer science is to sell
0.16%:  before you start telling people the song
0.16%:  like all theories of computer science post
0.16%:  before you listen to another person telling
0.16%:  I prefer to think of computer science as not being so log
0.16%:  I prefer to think of computer science as being a lonely
0.16%:  in the interest of keeping society from collapse I
0.16%:  in the interest of stopping before I really
0.20%:  in the interest of stopping before I really lose
0.16%:  the coolest part is being able to refer
0.16%:  computer science is a really boring thing to keep
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself so that more
0.16%:  computer science is really one of the biggest bo
0.16%:  it might also be cool if
0.33%:  it might also be cool if you
0.22%:  it might also be cool if people
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself lest I get
0.16%:  in the interest of space
0.16%:  like all of my research
0.16%:  not really cool enough to get free concert
0.16%:  since our entire economy rest
0.16%:  computer science is nothing like as
0.16%:  since it applies only to numbers longer
0.16%:  lately
0.16%:  the problem is if
0.16%:  before you go breaking into the police
0.16%:  after looking into the problem yourself
0.16%:  of course it only
1.56%:  of course it only applies to the
0.90%:  of course it only applies to things
1.31%:  of course it only applies to things like
0.62%:  of course it only applies if
0.52%:  of course it only applies to machines

0.20%:  of course it only applies to large
0.20%:  of course it only applies to some
0.19%:  of course it only applies if someone
0.18%:  of course it only applies if the song or
0.18%:  of course it only applies to boring
0.16%:  it only applies to the numbers being
0.16%:  because of legal problems
0.16%:  like all computer fact
0.16%:  computer science is going to be a little
0.16%:  is it cool enough to make people steal
0.16%:  computer science is really boring to talk to
0.16%:  unlike many aspects of religion
0.16%:  after looking into this recently
0.16%:  before you go making copies of entire
0.16%:  not enough to make people listen
0.16%:  most people are too busy being all
0.16%:  because of this lack
0.55%:  because of this lack of logic
0.16%:  some people are still trying to break
0.16%:  let us not forget there
0.66%:  let us not forget there are people
0.47%:  let us not forget there are millions
0.42%:  let us not forget there are people making
0.24%:  let us not forget there are millions of pieces
0.16%:  it occurs to me that if I can
0.16%:  be careful sharing
0.16%:  like the meaning
0.16%:  please keep it a secret or the
0.16%:  can you think of a better science for me to person
0.16%:  probably not cool enough to steal
0.16%:  can you imagine telling people there
0.16%:  being a computer scientist I barely
0.16%:  because of that one
0.51%:  because of that one little
4.88%:  because of that one little problem
0.28%:  because of that one property
0.26%:  because of that one little problem in
0.20%:  because of that one little error
0.16%:  because of that one little problem of
0.16%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer not to be seen
0.23%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer not to be seen hanging
0.16%:  on account of my secret feelings
0.16%:  be careful not to think of any more cool
0.16%:  be careful not to tell anyone! I think some
0.16%:  computer science is really boring so I gotta
0.16%:  for the sake of computer science being pretty
0.16%:  like all the best computer science notions of
0.16%:  like most other really
0.16%:  getting back to my personal opinions
0.16%:  being the computer scientist pro
0.16%:  to get back to our original problems
0.16%:  not really cool enough to keep from being rap
0.16%:  before you go claiming the first person to point
0.16%:  unlike a lot of these
0.16%:  the real problem is putting
0.16%:  in serious
0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as cool in concept
0.16%:  the point of computer science is only to learn
0.16%:  computer science is really not like the
0.16%:  before you start calling the police to come
0.16%:  in the process of trying to make perfect logical
0.16%:  in the interest of keeping my legal troubles on
0.16%:  before you look into
0.16%:  because most people think binary is too
0.16%:  like other computer science pione
0.16%:  I actually prefer to think of it more in
0.16%:  like all computer science theories of song
0.16%:  for some reason people still get in
0.16%:  like all great computer science stories!
0.16%:  before you call the police on me for being in
0.16%:  before you start looking to me for the
0.16%:  in the interest of not becoming popular for
0.16%:  it seems like a lot of people are trying to ignore
0.16%:  unlike other parts of myself
0.16%:  if you repeat it
0.16%:  like all great theories of computer science being
0.16%:  I still refuse
0.21%:  I still refuse to pay
0.20%:  I still refuse to release
0.22%:  I still refuse to release my porn
0.18%:  I still refuse to share
0.31%:  I still refuse to share my porn
0.16%:  it also forces
0.30%:  it also forces us to accept
0.19%:  it also forces me
0.21%:  it also forces me to think
0.16%:  most people only care about their song!
0.16%:  like all other computer science agents
0.16%:  before you go thinking it all
0.33%:  before you go thinking it all comes
0.16%:  not cool enough for me to skip
0.16%:  I think people still
0.16%:  the point of computer science is not a
0.27%:  the point of computer science is not a legal
0.16%:  back to the serious problem of creating
0.16%:  since there is no computer on
0.16%:  back to the original problem of trying to license
0.16%:  for some reason I feel like shouting
0.16%:  people are really boring
0.16%:  like a lot of computer science or theory
0.16%:  I think people are better
1.91%:  I think people are better off ignoring
0.61%:  I think people are better off ignoring it because
0.46%:  I think people are better off ignoring all
0.31%:  I think people are better off ignoring it!

0.20%:  I think people are better off not being
0.18%:  I think people are better off not really
0.16%:  I think people are better off learning

0.16%:  the problem is still
0.16%:  please keep it to yourself so there can
1.43%:  please keep it to yourself so there can be no conflict
0.16%:  before you go learning
0.17%:  before you go learning more
0.16%:  thanks for letting me be your
0.16%:  getting back to the porn problem
0.16%:  like all the best science fact
0.16%:  in the interest of not spoiling our
0.16%:  to really get into computer science in
0.25%:  to really get into computer science in general
0.16%:  it comes at the price of being able to lose your song
0.16%:  since the computer is capable of only
0.16%:  since the computer is capable of only one
0.16%:  like the computer science pro
0.16%:  at the risk of being entirely
0.20%:  at the risk of being entirely self
0.16%:  keep it to yourself in case the police become
0.16%:  computer science has been looking for an
0.16%:  I promise not to use it in
0.16%:  it also makes the entire concept of selling your
0.16%:  before you claim the song
0.16%:  it brings up some really cool
0.16%:  before you call the police for breaking into song
0.16%:  computer science is like anything
0.16%:  like all the best stuff I
0.21%:  like all the best stuff I come
0.16%:  before you start thanking me for science
0.16%:  unlike my personal feelings on
2.31%:  unlike my personal feelings on the topic
0.67%:  unlike my personal feelings on the topic of
0.16%:  computer science being so hot
0.16%:  before I continue my talk on
0.20%:  before I continue my talk on the
0.49%:  before I continue my talk on the logical
0.22%:  before I continue my talk on the topic
0.17%:  before I continue my talk on the logical in
0.16%:  there is no computer science in
0.16%:  I guess it only applies to a
0.16%:  the real cool part is coming
0.16%:  it comes at the price of being able to look upon
0.16%:  before you start claiming free content
0.16%:  the point of computer science I really like best
0.16%:  you can see the conflict
0.16%:  before I can really
0.16%:  being a computer scientist really rocks
0.16%:  keep it to yourself! I prefer things to be in
0.16%:  be careful not to mention this before a
0.16%:  the real problem is in
0.25%:  the real problem is in getting

0.16%:  I prefer to think of it as really being cool!
0.16%:  to get back to the original issue of online
0.16%:  I keep getting this really creep
0.16%:  computer science is really the best of
0.16%:  like so many other stories
0.16%:  the computer scientist really likes being
0.16%:  being a computer scientist rock
0.16%:  before you start looking for that missing
0.90%:  before you start looking for that missing piece
0.16%:  before anyone gets too precious
