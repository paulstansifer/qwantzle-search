1938,"where's that joker batman; sleepytime batman; walked outside half as bruce wayne and half as batman, said ""damnit"" and ran back inside batman",,"God: SO HEY T-REX YOU'VE INVENTED TWO LANGUAGES IN AS MANY DAYS
T-Rex: I know! Sometimes I worry my brilliance is a curse!
T-Rex: But then I remember that actually no, it's super great!
God: MAYBE YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON GETTING SPEAKERS OF THESE LANGUAGES THOUGH
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, will you learn my new languages? One makes you say the same sentence in different ways and the other's where you always have to talk about feelings.
Dromiceiomimus: I'll stick with Dinosaurese, thanks!
T-Rex: That's not a real thing
T-Rex: Utahraptor, you'll speak my languages, right?
Utahraptor: Man, they're all variants on English!
T-Rex: No, they're ORIGINAL languages copyright ME that are merely INSPIRED by Englis-
Utahraptor: Look, I'll give you an analogy. You know how you want an awesome Batman action figure?
T-Rex: Obviously!
Utahraptor: Right!
Off panel: But when you go to the store, all they have are Fishin' Ahoy Batman and Folly of Space Batman and you end up going home SAD and empty-handed again. THESE VARIANTS ARE YOUR NEW LANGUAGES.
T-Rex: NEVER
T-Rex (punchline): - has an analogy been so accurate and personally damaging

186,"they live in a small town where everybody knows everybody else's birthday, and also their grandfather's birthday",,"T-Rex: I heard it was somebody's birthday today...
T-Rex: My grandfather's!
T-Rex: Wow, that's exciting! I wonder who'll be at the party tonight?
T-Rex: Will there be cake?
T-Rex: I'll show off my balloon-animal-making skills!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, you missed his birthday! It was days ago!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Yeah, that's the thing with birthdays: they only come once a year, and if you miss the day, you miss out!
T-Rex: Shoot! I'll just have my own party for him then!
Narrator: THAT EVENING...
T-Rex: Wow... Grandfather sure knows how to throw a party!
T-Rex (punchline): Who wants some cake?
"
857,"i have long held that t2 is the platonic form of action movies.  all it's missing is a sex scene, and all that does to a movie is make it awkward to watch with your parents, so whatever!  living liquid metal robots from the future NEVA4GET",,"Narrator: DIFFERENT WAYS TO SAY GOODBYE:
T-Rex: Later!
Narrator: THAT WAY'S OKAY
Narrator: NEVER USE THIS WAY PLEASE:
T-Rex: Compadres! I bid you each... ADIEU!
Narrator: THIS WAY IS ALSO PRETTY TERRIBLE:
T-Rex: It's not ""goodbye"", just - ""farewell"". This isn't the end, Dromiceiomimus, but merely the end of an era. One door closes as another opens, and we can't forever live in the past! A new, brighter tomorrow beckons.
Narrator: I DON'T KNOW WHERE T-REX IS GOING WITH THIS. IT IS JUST ONE CLICHÉ AFTER ANOTHER. IF I COULD TALK TO T-REX I WOULD SAY, HELLO T-REX, WHAT IS THE DEAL.
Narrator: HERE'S A GOOD WAY:
T-Rex: Hasta la vista, tiny woman!
Utahraptor: Stop it, T-Rex!
Narrator: THAT WAS GOOD BECAUSE WE ALL SAW TERMINATOR 2. THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
Utahraptor: I liked it.
T-Rex: Oh my God, me too!!
Narrator: ANYWAY IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO SAY GOODBYE.
Narrator: THE ONLY TIME IT IS HARD IS WHEN YOU ARE SAYING A FINAL GOODBYE TO SOMEONE WHO MEANS MORE TO YOU THAN ANYTHING:
T-Rex (punchline): I'll always love you!
Narrator: WORDS WILL SEEM TRITE AND YOU'LL FOREVER REGRET YOUR INABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. THE END!

395,"alternate ending: 'the kid has like a bazillion parents!  and as you know, parents are the wingmen on the flight through life.'",,"T-Rex: Okay! So, we get a couple - no! - a polyamorous CROWD of people, who all want to have a child, but who are all infertile. So! Then we get a donated fertilized egg...
T-Rex: ... and bring it to term with a surrogate mother who is herself married!
T-Rex: THEN, you give the child to the polyamorous crowd, who have new members replace old ones quickly and quite often. Um, infinitely often.
T-Rex: THAT’S, I think, how you get a child with the highest number of people who could possibly claim parentage. Tada!
Utahraptor: You've outdone yourself this time, my friend!
T-Rex: How's that?
Utahraptor: Well, you’ve raised pretty much every socio-reproductive issue in the book, and also RUINED THE LIFE OF AN IMAGINARY CHILD.
T-Rex: I haven't ruined any lives! The kid has like a bazillion parents: think about his birthday!
T-Rex (punchline): PRESENTS

1795,"emily horne of a softer world and jeremy of cmdrriker.tumblr.com and i spent an evening gorged on pizza coming up with all these cards; good times, best times",,"T-Rex: Outside of the card is just the words ""I'M NOT GAY."", all caps, a nice bold sans-serif on a stark white background. You open it up, and in smaller type it reads ""but I'm gay for you""! And there's a little heart! OH MY GOD
T-Rex: ADORABLE
T-Rex: We're going to have a full line of cards, Dromiceiomimus! ""I'm not straight / but I'm straight for you"", and there's a little picture of a RULER.
Dromiceiomimus: That one should appeal to about one in ten people!
T-Rex: IT'S ADORABLE. ""I'm not sleepy / but I'll sleep with you.""? And there's a little picture of a teddybear in a nightcap? Oh snap! WE JUST MAXED OUT CUTE.
Utahraptor: ""I'm not here / but I'm here for you"", with a picture of a telephone?
T-Rex: Awww! Long-distance cards!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, we have to get on this. We can become card barons and EVEN BETTER, we can make the CUTEST CARDS EVER for every life situation. ""I'm not perfect / but I'm perfect for you""! ""I'm not happy / but I'm happy for you""?
Utahraptor: Those seem creepy and emo, respectively! What's that last one: a breakup card?

876,"if i can steal a joke from drmcninja.com: if you didn't whisper to yourself ''i do!'' in the first panel, then either you have just heard a lot of old jokes about oatmeal, or you are lying.",,"T-Rex: Who here would like to hear an old joke about oatmeal?
God: DAAAMN
God: I WOULD
T-Rex: Then here we go!
T-Rex: Okay okay, so there's this monastery, with three monks, and only one monk is allowed to speak, once, each year. They take turns! The first year, at breakfast, the first monk speaks and says ""I hate oatmeal."" A year later, again at breakfast, the second monk speaks and says ""I love oatmeal."" Finally, one year later, the last monk gets to speak and HE says ""I'm tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal!""
T-Rex: Hee hee! Comedy gold!
Utahraptor: Aw, that's an old joke!
T-Rex: BUT A GOOD ONE! It's funny, I think, because the conversation is spread over three years, and NORMALLY, you'd expect monks not to talk about oatmeal for that long.
Utahraptor: I think it's funny because monks are normally thought of as holy, not as oatmeal obsessed OR oatmeal loathing!
God: I THINK IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY
T-Rex: Is it?
God: WELL NO BUT I CAN MAKE IT SO IT IS IF YOU WANT
T-Rex: Dude!!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm afraid I'll have to insist!

976,DEAR MENTAL DIARY: NOBODY BETTER BE READING MY MENTAL DIARY,,"T-Rex: There sure are a lot of songs about dancing! I have probably heard at LEAST three hundred songs about dancing.
God: ACTUALLY YOU'VE HEARD 1365 SONGS ABOUT DANCING
T-Rex: Aww, you counted!
T-Rex: So why is music so reflexive? There aren't tons of paintings about PAINTING, for example. Or plays and/or movies about sitting and watching a play and/or movie, for that matter!
Dromiceiomimus: Actually T-Rex, that's not really true, and plus that's not really a fair comparison. Dancing is something you do in response to music! There are lots of paintings, films and plays that really ARE about your response to them.
T-Rex: Well! SO MUCH FOR THAT FUNNY RANT.
Utahraptor: Looks like!
T-Rex: Wait, this can still be salvaged! Utahraptor, you know what I dislike? PEOPLE AT THE GROCERY STORE WHO TAKE A LONG TIME AT THE CASH, FOR VARIOUS REASONS!!
Utahraptor: Yep!
T-Rex: They, um - they sure could be faster, is what I'm sayin'.
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] Dear mental diary: everyone here sucks. Maybe I should take my act to the grocery store!

1218,"every comic over the past 5 years was just setting the stage for this joke. thanks for reading, everyone!!",,"T-Rex: A few months ago I said I wanted to be a stand-up comedian. It turns out it's a lot of work?
T-Rex: But guys! I still totally want to be a stand-up comedian!
T-Rex: So I've been doing RESEARCH. I've been going to Comedy Club after Komedy Klub and figuring out how their performers make jokes. It's easy to duplicate the bad comedians, but it's hard to figure out the good ones!
Dromiceiomimus: How so?
T-Rex: Comedy relies on surprise, I think! There's a twist that makes a joke funny, and I haven't figured out a generative algorithm yet.
Utahraptor: Hey, I wanted to try stand-up too!
T-Rex: Then come with me tonight: we'll go to a show!
Narrator: AFTER THE SHOW:
T-Rex: Man! How do those guys do it? Every comedian up there was HILARIOUS and I don't know why. Especially the Triceratops.
Utahraptor: Comedy's hard, I guess!
T-Rex: I just can't figure out these... these Dinosaur Comics.
God: OH GOD
T-Rex: What?
T-Rex (punchline): You know what? It's really weird when you say that.

2311,THIS IS WHERE OUR STORY ENDS,,"T-Rex: Tired of all the things you usually eat? Maybe it's time for
T-Rex: ETHNIC FOOD??

Dromiceiomimus: I don't know if these really count as ethnic food.
T-Rex: Oh, I get it. You want VEGETABLES.
T-Rex: Well, there are tons of vegetables you maybe haven't eaten yet!
Utahraptor: NO! T-Rex, stop! YOU'LL TRIGGER THE ELDRITCH CURSE!!
T-Rex: Try Chinese eggplant, Hawaiian eggplant, Indian eggplant, Filipino eggplant, Holland eggplant, American eggplant, Japanese eggplant, Thai eggplant, Italian eggplant and if you'd rather be the ball than the boot, Sicilian eggplant. Not to mention Cambodian green giant eggplant, Loa lavender eggplant,
Utahraptor: No
T-Rex (punchline): [crying black tears] Lebanese brunching eggplant, Ukrainian beauty eggplant, green goddess eggplant, pea eggplant, white eggplant, Rosa Bianca eggplant, green apple eggplant, graffiti eggplant, Zoa eggplant, black egg eggplant, little fingers eggplant, little green eggplant, Zahara eggplant, Turkish orange eggplant, long wh

1575,"yes, he was good enough to leave infinite heirs infinity dollars to split infinitely equally among themselves",,"T-Rex: David Hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1862. He built an infinite hotel, you guys!
Narrator: THE INFINITE HOTEL
Narrator: A TRUE STORY
T-Rex: So Hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms; I believe this was a matter of some investment. But build it he did, and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up, with each of them wanting a room! Lucky for Hilbert he had his infinite hotel, so each guest got a room, and the hotel was filled up to capacity. Nice! But just then another friggin' bus showed up, and it ALSO had infinity people in it!
Utahraptor: Nobody builds for TWO infinite buses showing up right after the other!
T-Rex: Turns out they do!
T-Rex: He just told every guest already there to move into the room that was double their current room number. So the guest in room 3 moved into room 6, and so on! Thus, only the even-numbered rooms were occupied, and everyone on the new bus could have an odd-numbered room!
Utahraptor: Amazing!
T-Rex: Yep! Anyway!
T-Rex (punchline): It's my understanding he died an infinitely rich man infinity years later

1051,"Afterwards, Antonio Tony said, 'My credit card debt and car payments are two sides of the same coin', and continued, 'much like these breasts which I now see before me.' Amelia paused. 'I cannot help but wonder about your name', said Amelia.",,"T-Rex: ""On The Menu, by T-Rex."". Ahem. ""As Amelia and Antonio Tony who are the two members of the wait staff in this story took off their clothes, they realized that sexual intercourse was probably 'On The Menu' tonight!""
T-Rex: ""'Excellent!' they said, in unison!""
T-Rex: ""Well, almost in unison. Antonio Tony, the man, was a little slow on that. It was because he was thinking of his taxes. '10 thousand dollars in taxes!', he thought, 'That is a lot of money. Where am I going to find that money?' Then Antonio Tony and Amelia had sexual relations.""
T-Rex: ""The sexual intercourse was cut short because Tony kept muttering 'Where am I gonna find the 10 thousand dollars though?'""
Utahraptor: What are you reciting, T-Rex?
T-Rex: My new book!
T-Rex: It's called ""On The Menu: Sexy Stories for People With Problems"" and in all the stories the sex gets derailed because the people are worried about their Problems. The cover looks like a menu because it ties in well with the title. Now, if you'll allow me to continue?
Utahraptor: Of course!
T-Rex: ""One day a couple was having sex but their car window was broken. The man thought a kid broke it. Instead of sex they wondered how it happened. I, the narrator, was the one who did it! They never found out and I won the lottery! The end!!""
T-Rex (punchline): Okay even I think that one's not so good.

1997,"the kids leave, but then they came back... WITH KNIVES... CHAU FROM THE ACCLAIMED COMIC SERIES ""SCOTT PILGRIM"", READ IT TODAY",,"T-Rex: Last night I dreamed I was out on a picnic table with all my personal electronics, and this group of kids thought it was a garage sale!
T-Rex: Okay YES I KNOW DREAMS ARE STUPID, but bear with me!
T-Rex: So these kids are picking up my stuff, but suddenly it's not my stuff, it's my friends' stuff, so I can't just give it away. And when I say ""it's not for sale"", they're grabbing them tighter and saying ""Come on, I'm sure it is."" So I yell for my friends and when they show up the kids leave, but then they come back... WITH KNIVES.
T-Rex: And THEN, I woke up!
Utahraptor: I thought you said this was a good story!
T-Rex: It is!
T-Rex: THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE. I used IMAGINATION to see what happens next! We defeated the kids using punches, and then you were secretly one kid on another kid's shoulders wearing a Utahraptor suit, so I had to punch you too!
Utahraptor: Huh. I guess I prefer your unconscious mind's stories to your conscious efforts?
T-Rex: My conscious mind says ""ouch"" but my unconscious says... ""hey thanks me too""?! What the hell, unconscious!!
T-Rex: We're ALL on the same team, and you need to stay CONSCIOUS of that!

2246,"that big bang one is the Prime Directive, the Double Prime Directive, AND the Combining Prime Directive",,"T-Rex: Gosh but it's sometimes hard to know what the right thing to do is! If only there were a series of rules to tell me what to do in every situation!
Narrator: DEONTOLOGY COMIX
T-Rex: Deontology, Dromiceiomimus! It's where you follow rules to act ethically.
Dromiceiomimus: So like, ""Thou shalt not kill?""
T-Rex: Exactly! Once I have the rules chosen, I no longer have to worry if a given act is ethical or not, I just have to make sure it follows the rules! This leaves me free to think about other stuff, like how cute would it be if cats and dogs had puppens?
T-Rex: Maybe they'd be called kuppies??
Utahraptor: So thou is totally not going to kill, right?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: Okay, here's one dude who's going to go back in time and stop the Big Bang from exploding, and he's not going to kill a thousand dudes. He's going to kill ALL LIFE THAT HAS OR EVER WILL BE. The only way to stop him is to kill him. If you keep with your rule and let him go, everybody dies! T-REX, YOU ARE A MONSTER.
T-Rex: Oh, no bigs, I have another rule that says it's okay to kill if I really want to. More precisely, it says ""harm may be done if it's an effect of a greater good""!
T-Rex (punchline): But come on, if you want to mess with the Big Bang I'ma shoot you in the head!!

1828,"this is my worst comic ever because everyone reading it at work just got reminded to get back to work.  ""FRIIIG, THANKS A LOT RYAN"" they're saying.  i'm saying that too, actually",,"T-Rex: Wouldn't it be amazing to write down everything you are and everything you know into a book, so that someone reading it could know you as well as you know yourself?
T-Rex: Hey!
T-Rex: I'll save you the trouble; the answer is ""OBVIOUSLY, YES IT WOULD BE""!
T-Rex: So um, why hasn't anyone done this already?
Dromiceiomimus: Because it's probably not even POSSIBLE to capture an entire person in a book, and even if it were, there's just too much information? I'm not convinced our brains have enough space to store ourselves PLUS all of another person at the same time!
T-Rex: No problem! Write your own book, and you can restore yourself from backup by reading it after!
Utahraptor: But then I'd be backup me, and I'd have no memories of reading the other book!
T-Rex: ...TRUE.
T-Rex: Okay, so record yourself on camera when you've read my book, and then when you restore from your book you can watch the footage and say ""Hey, I made a pretty sweet T-Rex. Maybe I should read that book again.""
Utahraptor: ...Don't you have, like - a job you should be at right now?

I'll do it by putting out a new, less controversial book: ""LOLITA III: This Time, She's 30"".
T-Rex: Nobody can argue with that!!
T-Rex: In my story there's a new Lolita, and she's thirty, and she goes out with a man who's also thirty and from a similar economic and social background! They get married and have some okay times. Years later, all the characters die of old age!
Dromiceiomimus: It seems a bit - conservative!
T-Rex: I could make some changes! But did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though?
Narrator: THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED:
Utahraptor: T-Rex, your new book is basically terrible!
T-Rex: *gasp*
Utahraptor: I'm serious! The ""new Lolita"" has nothing to do with the old one, and nothing interesting happens except when ""LoHEta"" shows up, explains that he's the new manly male Lolita, and then leaves the narrative entirely.
T-Rex: He shows up again in the epilogue! Utahraptor! You didn't even finish my book!!
T-Rex: At the end, Loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace ""she"" with ""he"" and ""hers"" with ""definitely his"" in the ORIGINAL Lolita, you can read all about his adventures!
T-Rex (punchline): It's called ""setting up a spinoff""; look it up?

2407,"""given up on studying their own fleshy bodies"" is a phrase that can preface many professions.  artists have given up on studying their own fleshy bodies to draw pictures of other people's instead!  astronauts have given up on studying their own fleshy bodies and instead prefer to spend their time floating in deadly space.",,"T-Rex: Okay so I didn't help anyone learn about computers yesterday. I MESSED UP. But we will fix that today! YES. Okay!
T-Rex: *ahem*
T-Rex: What IS a computer?
T-Rex: Scientists have studied them for years to come up with an answer to this question. These highly specialized scientists, known as ""computer scientists"", have given up on studying their own fleshy bodies to instead study the hard transistors, the finely sculpted semiconductors, and the gleaming metal bodies of our strange electronic offspring.
Utahraptor: This sounds kinda - sexy?
T-Rex: Damn dude, you know it is!
T-Rex: Computers may have quad-core processors instead of quadriceps, but to the computer scientist these ""quads"" are just as alluring as the muscles of any flesh Adonis!
Utahraptor: So what IS a computer?
T-Rex (punchline): PURE FREEBASED SEX.

T-Rex: Not enough sand!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh! Why don't PROFESSION MEMBERS play hide and seek?
T-Rex: Why?
Dromiceiomimus: Because no one will look for them!
T-Rex: Hah! Ouch for PROFESSION MEMBERS, and their stereotype!
Utahraptor: Hey, are we telling PROFESSION jokes?
T-Rex: We are!
Utahraptor: Okay, why do PROFESSION MEMBERS leave AN IDENTIFYING INSTRUMENT OF THEIR PROFESSION on the dashboard of their cars?

1827,QUICK QUESTION: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME YOU COULD JUST ASK FOR SEXY TIMES,,"T-Rex: There's a species of side-blotched lizards where the males have coloured throats, and they're either orange, blue, or yellow! The orange ones are biggest, the blue ones are medium sized, and the yellow ones are tiniest.
T-Rex: I PROMISE THIS STORY TOTALLY GETS BETTER.
T-Rex: Okay, so what's awesome is that the big orange lizards are toughest: they beat up the blue lizards and steal their girlfriend! But the blue lizards can defend against the smaller yellow ones, AND they form stronger relationships. Meanwhile, the yellow ones are so small that they can sneak in and sex up the orange lizard's girlfriend while he's out fighting! The blue lizard's sweeties are in committed relationships though, so Yellow can't seduce them away.
Utahraptor: So orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: Or in other words: Rock Paper Scissors. So awesome! These lizards are playing it endlessly, only they're way more hardcore than us, because they're PLAYING FOR SEX.
Utahraptor: I've played Rock Paper Scissors for sex.
T-Rex: ...Okay that wasn't where I saw this conversation going but yeah let's do this.
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: So you REALLY chose paper and he chose rock and then you had sexy times?
Off panel: For the third time: YES.
T-Rex: REALLY?? It was that easy? Because -
T-Rex (punchline): - because stories like this make me worry I'm living my life wrong

2080,"there!  now each person who wrote me an email about ""they"" being singular should be happy.  i... hope this was exactly what bitches was looking for?",,"T-Rex: Okay, so APPARENTLY a singular, gender-neutral ""they"" has a long and proud history.
T-Rex: APPARENTLY, even Willy T. Shakespeare himself used ""they"" this way!
T-Rex: And APPARENTLY, I'm not unarguably in the right when I say that ""they"" is always plural. FINE. Everyone makes mistakes; I suppose it's fair that I'd FINALLY get my very first turn at bat. But that doesn't mean English is getting off scot free! We still need an UNCONTENTIOUS gender-neutral pronoun.
Dromiceiomimus: What happened to ""thon""?
T-Rex: In a shouted sentence?
T-Rex: THON NOT KNOW WHY NOBODY LIKE THON
Utahraptor: There are still some other alternatives you haven't considered, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Such as?
Utahraptor: How about ""yo""? As in, ""Yo doesn't know what yo thinks about this."" Or ""bitches"", as in ""Bitches didn't derive that function properly"". Men can be bitches!
T-Rex: Man. Men CAN be bitches.

God: HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT
T-Rex: We can do better!
T-Rex: And YES, novel punctuation has been proposed before, and usually they're combinations of existing marks: question plus exclamation gives you the interrobang! Snooze! Comma plus exclamation gives you the exclamation comma. Oh, sorry, I just FELL ASLEEP because of how boring these punctuation marks are.
T-Rex: I just RHETORICALLY FELL ASLEEP.
Utahraptor: You propose something different?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
T-Rex: OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD: punctuation that says ""I'm saying this literally but I'd love for you to read into it"". So I could say ""Hey, we should hang out more"" or ""The eagle cries at midnight"" and folks would pause and say ""YES. YES WE SHOULD/IT DOES.""
Utahraptor: You'll need a mark for this punctuation!
T-Rex: No problem! It's a tarantula staring intently at you, all 88_88

1336,You've got questions. We've got intercourse.,,"T-Rex: Whenever I think of the phrase ""good to the last drop"" I think of friggin' Maxwell House Coffee.
T-Rex: I don't even drink coffee!
T-Rex: They have lexicalized the phrase AND associated it in my mind with their stupid branding!
T-Rex: And if someone says ""can't get enough of that Sugar Crisp"" NOT ONLY do I think of Sugar Crisp, I think of the jingle too!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh, actually, about that: they're rebranding it, T-Rex. It's now referred to as ""Golden Crisp"" in most major markets.
T-Rex: WHAT? They store a phrase in my sparkling mind and now they're abandoning it? I call FRIGGIN' SHENANIGANS on that!
Utahraptor: So what are you going to do?
T-Rex: Um, refer to it as ""Sugar Crisp"" till the day I die??
T-Rex: Except THEN I'll just be reinforcing their original branding. Okay, tell you what: I can't forget the slogans but I CAN substitute their brands with something I do want to remember, like intercourse!

I then repeat the process on the winners over and over, until I've got a small group that's seen me be right EVERY SINGLE TIME. Then I say ""enough freebies, you gotta pay me now"" and have become a scam artiste!

Dromiceiomimus: Sweet! So what are we looking for, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Okay so in 1958 these two US Air Force planes were doing training exercises with a real nuclear bomb for some reason, and they crashed into each other! And one of the planes was so damaged that it had to jettison its bomb above a bay in Georgia!
Dromiceiomimus: We're searching for a nuclear bomb!?
T-Rex: Serial number 47782, baby!
Utahraptor: This bomb was missing its nuclear capsule though, T-Rex! It wouldn't explode.
T-Rex: Aw man! NEVERMIND.
Utahraptor: Yeah, where you REALLY want to look is beneath the ice in Greenland. Another crash there had four nuclear weapons involved, but only debris from three was recovered. There was evidence the fourth - or parts of it - had been so heated by the resulting fire that it melted down through the ice. Serial number 78252!

Dromiceiomimus: All you can eat?
T-Rex: All you can eat KNUCKLE SANDWICHES! The Chinese Buffet serves Chinese food AND knuckle sandwiches to those who are cruisin' for a steaming plate of them. I cannot stress this enough: it's all you can eat.
T-Rex: I can ALSO say ""Looks like it's LADIES' NIGHT at the Buffet tonight!"" Hee hee!
Utahraptor: For when you... beat up women?
T-Rex: No, for after I beat up a dude and want to imply that he's actually a woman, in case he's the sort of guy who gets mad at that! Although I COULD also use it if I fought women - like, a cabal of sexy, yet EVIL, librarians!
Utahraptor: You will be prepared if that happens! The only problem is: you're not Chinese?

We can recognize HOW it was supposed to be funny, but there's comedic writing from a hundred years ago that goes right over our heads today, simply because we don't have the cultural context to recognize that jokes are being made, that parody and satire are taking place. Ouch for those guys! Ouch for us in 200 years!
Utahraptor: Well, most everything changes with time, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I guess!
T-Rex: But I think comedy changes more than most. We can read serious writing from centuries ago and the arguments are WAY more accessible than any jokes.

T-Rex: AWESOME.
Utahraptor: Hey! What's up, Dixie Cup?
T-Rex: NICE.

Dromiceiomimus: And so modest, too!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, let's put modesty aside for a second and just ""rap"", person to person. I think when we do that, we can agree: there's nothing I've done that I haven't excelled at.
Utahraptor: You're so egotistical! ""I'm great at everything I've tried!""
T-Rex: We're putting ego ASIDE today, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: You know what? It's still egotistical, and if you've succeeded at everything you've tried, you're not trying hard enough things. Here, here's something to try: why don't you cure cancer? And hey, why not come up with a clean, safe, cheap, efficient, powerful, renewable AND reliable energy source while you're at it?

Dromiceiomimus: You'll have a lot of updating to do, T-Rex! Dead horses get beaten while gift horses get looked in the mouth, which, INCIDENTALLY, is also where reliable information comes straight from!
Utahraptor: Yeah! Maybe you should get off your high horse before you put the cart before that same horse!
T-Rex: That's only like TWO examples.

I also don't believe there's convincing evidence for anyone having kissed someone SO HARD that both people exploded, so I will have to regretfully concede that I don't believe that's happened yet either. But, at least I won't believe in anything I can't prove! Thanks, evidentialism!
Utahraptor: But - how do you know to believe your evidence, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Dude! It's EVIDENCE.
Utahraptor: Yeah, but this evidence must need justification to be believed. So evidence requires its own evidence, and so you have an infinite chain of proof. This spells disaster for you my friend!
T-Rex: A valid attack, perhaps strengthened by the old ""what if we're all just brains in jars"" question!

T-Rex: The Ultimate Song is, objectively, the best song. We all thought it was impossible - that music was too varied, tastes too wide - for one song to be universally the best, but whether by chance or by design, it now exists. All other songs suffer in comparison. There is a brief artistic movement obsessed with flaws, imperfection, but that only gets us so far. We keep coming back to the song: it's perfect. Why would we listen to anything else?
Utahraptor: Don't songs eventually get old?
T-Rex: Imperfect songs do, yeah! Perfect ones, not so much.
T-Rex: Everyone tries to learn from the perfect song, reverse-engineer it: can we use it to produce the perfect painting? Poem? The perfect justice system? But we fail. It seems Earth is to touch perfection but once, and this is it: one single song.
Utahraptor: Wow. I mean, what do songs DO?
T-Rex: That's what consumes us. We encode the song into the golden records of the Voyager spacecraft, racing them towards distant stars. It's not because we want to share: it's a planet's last, desperate cry for help.

This was for some the only time their face would be recorded, and they happened to shift.
T-Rex: That's sad! That's profoundly sad!
Utahraptor: Is it because those blurred faces remind you that no matter what, the past can never be completely known?
T-Rex: Kind of! But I think what affects me the most is the idea of someone coming that close to achieving at least a type of immortality, and then losing it to something as natural and ordinary as glancing away.

2444,or she was greedy and wanted more gold WHO CAN SAY,,"Narrator: THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS: A FAIRY TALE
T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a goose that laid golden eggs! The farmer who owned the goose was getting super rich, but she also had some questions!
T-Rex: Questions like ""what energy is required by the goose in order to facilitate this apparent transmutation?""
T-Rex: She began a regime of careful observation! After a few weeks she had a few data points. ONE: the goose was not eating any gold, so it must be produced internally. TWO: gold produced / (food consumed + body mass lost) = 5% = a transmutation efficiency equation. And THREE: other geese feeding in the same area would not produce golden eggs. So she concluded, quite rightly, that the phenomenon was related to the goose itself!
Utahraptor: And she couldn't breed it, because its eggs were solid gold.
T-Rex: Exactly.
T-Rex: The only way left to learn more was dissection! So, for science, she gave up a source of great personal riches. UNFORTUNATELY, she lived in a world with primitive scientific instruments, and without microscopes and cellular analysis she was unable to discover the production mechanism.
T-Rex (punchline): Nevertheless, her selfless actions stopped the gold market from collapse, saving her country from an economic catastrophe and decades-long recession. She is remembered today as a great woman and an early proponent of the scientific method.

T-Rex: So the gods show up and they're thinking ""This is gross. This is a stew made out of a dude. PASS."" except for one god whose daughter just got abducted so she's sad and so she eats the stew? Because she's distracted? By sadness? Anyway after the dinner party Zeus decides he has the technology to rebuild stew guy, and so he orders it done, only AN ENTIRE SHOULDER is missing because it got eaten. By a god. Because she was sad.
Utahraptor: So they get him a new shoulder made of ivory!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: And clearly, THAT SOLVES ALL THE PROBLEMS. The kid grows up super handsome, and to punish Tantalus for his - hosting? - they put him in a pool of water just beneath the branches of a fruit tree.

Utahraptor: Yep!
Utahraptor: You're a mass of bones and meat with needs and desires, of course that's affected who you are! If I wasn't bones and meat with needs and desires myself, I'd be SHOCKED the system even works!

Utahraptor: You're only ever going to win half of these games!

T-Rex: Pornography for everyone!
T-Rex: Obviously, you can't control how explicit images are, since they're set. But, you CAN control how explicit text is, since any images there are imagined by the reader. So all you need to do is craft sexy fiction that relies on the reader generating any eroticism in the scene! That way, they only have themselves to blame if they imagine something they think is way too sexy.
Utahraptor: I'd like to see an example!
T-Rex: Of course!
T-Rex: ""Pat and Alex had some sort of relationship. One time they were expressing it physically - in a remarkable way! Their location: erotic. Upon seeing it a third party would likely say ""How are they... wow. Just - wow.""

2066,"let's see where you're going with this, burger king",,"T-Rex: So it turns out there's this ""space treaty"" that all these nations signed, saying none of them would ever claim ownership over moons or other planets. They've declared celestial bodies as common heritage for all sentient species!
T-Rex: Good for you, nations!
T-Rex: I didn't sign that treaty, nations!!
Dromiceiomimus: HOLLA
Utahraptor: But you're a citizen of a nation that signed it!
T-Rex: Possibly? I GUESS??
Utahraptor: My point is: if for some reason a nation took an ownership claim of yours seriously, they'd have a valid way to pressure your government to make you fall in line! You could go to jail.
T-Rex: I could cause an INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT??
Utahraptor: Yes but that's not necessarily a good thi-
Narrator: THIRTY SECONDS LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, government? This is T-Rex on speakerphone. I hereby claim ownership to ALL the other planets! You can look at them with telescopes if you want.
Off panel: Sir, this is Burger King, home of the Whopper.

873,"if you're looking to set yourself up for a fall, you should go around telling people how you plan to remain sane.  then if you go crazy later on, oh wow!  everyone will say 'remember how truly intent he used to be on remaining sane?  how ironic.'",,"T-Rex: I have the best idea ever for a series of books! Oh MAN. I'll be rich and famous!
T-Rex: Two words:
T-Rex: Shakespeare prequels!
T-Rex: Cha-ching! It's great, because everyone loves Shakespeare AND ALSO finding out what characters were up to before they got interesting. It'll be Hamlet, only he's happy and well-adjusted, walking around saying ""I certainly hope my father doesn't get murdered! InDEED!"" and then Ophelia says ""That's right, baby! I, incidentally, plan to remain sane."" and then there's IRONY. Shakespeare fans love irony!
Utahraptor: So it's just Hamlet?
T-Rex: No way dude!
T-Rex: It's ALL the famous plays. All's Well that Begins Well! Prince Lear! Romeo and Juliet Babies! That one's Romeo and Juliet, only they're tiny and smelly.
Utahraptor: That one actually sounds really awesome.
T-Rex: I know!
Narrator: SOON, T-REX IS PITCHING HIS IDEA TO A PUBLISHER:
T-Rex: ""For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Baby Juliet and her Baby Romeo"".

791,vampire day is a holiday t-rex invented where you all dress up as vampires and get bitey.  it did not survive the cretaceous-tertiary extinction event?,,"T-Rex: The worst part of owning a cape is having to find excuses to wear it.
Narrator: T-REX HAS A CAPE
Narrator: LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
T-Rex: Luckily, I am just the dude to manufacture such excuses! I have the perfect plan. Since it sucks to be the only dude in the room wearing a cape, I will simply start telling people that EXISTING holidays are now cape-wearing holidays. Like... Thanksgiving!
Dromiceiomimus: Thanksgiving?
T-Rex: Yes! It is now a day to give thanks AND wear stylish outmoded fashions.
Narrator: NOW IT'S THANKSGIVING!
Utahraptor: You forgot to wear your stupid cape, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aw damn!!
T-Rex: But YOU forgot to wear it too, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: Yeah, but I was never going to.
T-Rex: Well! I certainly hope you'll change your mind for VAMPIRE DAY next week. I'm DEFINITELY not forgetting my cape for that!

1562,maslow: more than poop jokes?  we may never know.,,"T-Rex: Maslow was a dude who put all of our needs and desires into a hierarchy! The whole idea was that you can't satisfy any desire at the top of the hierarchy until you satisfy those beneath it.
T-Rex: Nice going, Maslow!
T-Rex: At the top is SELF ACTUALIZATION, which sounds pretty great, right? Except you can't get there unless you've already satisfied the level beneath it, which is esteem. And you don't get esteem - both self and from others - without relationships, and you don't worry about friggin' relationships until your basic safety needs are met. And finally, you don't worry about basic safety if you need to poop!
Utahraptor: ""You don't worry about basic safety if you need to poop.""
T-Rex: Maslow said it, not me!
T-Rex: Well, he said the gist of it.
Utahraptor: He did, did he?
T-Rex: Okay, no, but he DID come up with the theoretical framework that allows a phrase such as mine to be reasonably constructed in a meaningful context.
T-Rex: Don't look at me like that, Utahraptor! If my life's work is only used by some guy decades down the line to crack wise about poopin', I'll count myself as one lucky dude with one awesome legacy.
T-Rex (punchline): I set 'em up, future generations knock 'em down!

T-Rex: That's right! I said it!!
T-Rex: Not enough things glow in the dark, AND, the things that glow in the dark don't glow in the dark for long enough. Even if I had a glow-in-the-dark skull it would only glow for like, two minutes. That is only two kinds of spooky: spookily sucky and spookily DISAPPOINTING.
T-Rex: All I ever wanted is a plastic skull that lights up in the dark, so that in the dark, everyone can see my spooky plastic skull!
Utahraptor: This sounds like a battery problem, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Alright, fine, so it's a battery problem!
Utahraptor: But the issue is that batteries are hard to design: you want to store large amounts of energy for cheap, but you also don't want them to, you know, explode. It's tricky!
T-Rex: I don't need a laptop battery! All I want is a spooky skull, so that when criminals break into my house, they see a grim visage of things to come.
Narrator: LAST NIGHT:
T-Rex: [thinks] Oh no! Are those criminals breaking into my house?!
Off panel: We're criminals, but we're afraid of skulls. Lucky thing it's dark, because even if there were some here, we wouldn't see them!

1904,"there's ghost crimes, and then there's illegal ghost crimes, and it would behove you to remember the difference",,"T-Rex: So it's June 21st, 1931 and Lieutenant Hubert G. Chevis is about to dine on a meal of Manchurian partridge with his wife!
T-Rex: Apparently it is Old-Timey Stereotype Day for Lieutenant Hubert Chevis!
T-Rex: So Hubert takes a few bites and says ""This is gross; try it, it's gross"" and his wife licks it and says ""Yeah, gross"" and so they direct their culinary staff to incinerate the partridges.
T-Rex: Because it's Old-Timey Stereotype Day, remember?
T-Rex: And then within hours Hubert is dead of strychnine poisoning and his wife is super sick!
T-Rex: Three days later, Hubert's dad gets a telegram that reads simply ""HOORAY HOORAY HOORAY"".
Utahraptor: So creepy!
T-Rex: Isn't it? It was signed ""J. HARTIGAN"", but nobody around had that name. Someone with his description HAD bought strychnine from a pharmacy a few weeks back though.
Utahraptor: Pharmacies sold... poison?
T-Rex: Old-Timey Stereotype Day was apparently a month-long event!!
T-Rex: But the spookiest part? The killer is almost certainly dead now, and that means that according to SOME theories of the afterlife, he's now a ghost committing ILLEGAL GHOST CRIMES!!
T-Rex (punchline): Wait no that's the dumbest part; frig I get those two confused like ALL THE TIME

T-Rex: What's the worst that could happen?!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, assuming you and the lady friend broke up for a reason, won't these problems still be there?
T-Rex: Maybe, but I don't think so! We're different, more mature people now, and if we make sure it's more casual - less high expectations, less intense - I really think it could work!
Utahraptor: More casual, eh? More like more casual KISSING, probably!
T-Rex: No!
T-Rex: I've really tried to separate sex from it. I don't know. I'd just like to try it again: hanging out, doing things together, having fun, only now with a non-zero chance of smooches!

T-Rex: But I don't know anything about what's going on with my body!!
T-Rex: I'm serious. If purple poops start coming out of this bad boy tomorrow morning, I will have NO IDEA what's wrong. All I'll be able to do is walk into a doctor's office and say, ""Sup? Listen, purple poops are coming out of my bum: awesome, or cause for concern? Here's some money, so let me know!""
Dromiceiomimus: That's what we have doctors for, T-Rex! They let us know our problems for money!
T-Rex: But that's my point! We ALL have bodies!
Utahraptor: So we... should all be doctors?
T-Rex: Yes! Shouldn't we? If you were a robot, wouldn't you store a copy of your blueprints and repair manual in your cyber brain somewhere? Doesn't that just seem... REASONABLE?

T-Rex: Yeah, but the remaining 30%? THIRSTY CHUMPS.
Utahraptor: Look, calm down! You've made it this far without thirsting to death.
T-Rex: I didn't know I had a sliding two-day thirst death window then! People can go WEEKS without food! Months! Two days without water is ridiculous.

Dromiceiomimus: Premarital sex!

193,that's the kind of story that should wait until at least a second date,,"Narrator: HOW TO MEET NEW PEOPLE
T-Rex: Meeting new people can be fun!
T-Rex: It can be tiring if you are meeting a lot of new people at once, however. Here are some tips on how to meet lots of people at once:
T-Rex: • Wear something that will identify you and make you easy-to-remember! I recommend a ""crazy"" scarf or a large disfiguring scar.
T-Rex: • Listen attentively to people's names when you meet them! If their name is the same as yours, laugh!
Utahraptor: I've got one!
Utahraptor: • Try to remember interesting stories about yourself. Having such stories close at hand allows you both to fill in awkward gaps in conversation, and also acts to give people a quick, hopefully representative picture of yourself!
T-Rex (punchline): Like when I lost someone's baby!

2363,"ever since logic was invented, it's been hard times for legendary beings.",,"T-Rex: Do giants exist? The answer is no, because come on, they're giants, they're so big and we would've noticed them by now. Sorry giants, but you are all fake.
T-Rex: That's right, I said it!
T-Rex: You are a bunch of fake-ass bros, giants!!
T-Rex: But maybe INVISIBLE giants exist? Again, the answer is no: such giant weight would require giant feet, which would leave impressions in the ground visible in satellite imagery. It's kinda why we invented satellites in the first place?
Dromiceiomimus: No it's not.
T-Rex: FINE. It's kinda among the reasons some speculate we had for inventing satellites in the first place?
Utahraptor: Okay, but what about FLYING invisible giants?
T-Rex: Again, these are imaginary.
T-Rex: Any living being requires energy, which means we'd notice them when they fed. And they can't be solar powered, because light's already passing through them! Therefore: fake.
Utahraptor: Huh.
Off panel: But maybe they absorb only a small amount of non-visible spectrum light and they live in space and that's what dark matter is??
T-Rex: *gasp*
T-Rex (punchline): I know just enough about science for that to be really credible!!

1275,"space restrictions in panel six forced me to cut five paragraphs of stunt description. basically it was the stunt driver pulling every stunt ever pulled, back to back, WHILE SHE PUNCHED OUT TERRORISTS WHO DESERVED IT",,"T-Rex: If I were impatient, I'd be a jerkier person. I'd always be hurrying people up, and people would not want to hang around me in grocery store lines.
T-Rex: Furthermore, if I didn't have my sense of humour, chicks would like me less!
T-Rex: Clearly, my personality is Important! It's why my friends like me. But strokes can change people's personality, and anyone can have one at BASICALLY any time! It's totally ridiculous. My body already has like five ways it can betray me for no reason that I can name off the top of my head, and those ways are called Alzheimer's, Old Age, Respiratory Failure, Heart Attacks, Terminal Boner Fever, and Dementia. IT DOES NOT NEED ANOTHER.
Utahraptor: ""Oooh, look at me, I'm T-Rex and I've found another way to be terrified of the future!""
T-Rex: I'm not!
T-Rex: I'm terrified of DYING. Totally different.
Utahraptor: Most everyone else gets through life without being terrified of death, T-Rex, and some even look death in the face every day! You should talk to stunt drivers, or like, bear aggravators. You could learn from them!
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Excuse me, stunt driver? Are YOU afraid of death?

Dromiceiomimus: Really! Why the bird?
T-Rex: It stands for ""I will flip the bird RIGHT NOW to anyone who doesn't like hugs; I'm not even joking.""
Dromiceiomimus: Interesting! And also true!
Utahraptor: I heard that tattoos with the letter ""h"" in them...
T-Rex: ...Yes?
Utahraptor: Well, I heard that an ""h"" in any tattoo is short for ""Hey, Ask Me About My Sexual History"", and a second ""h"" on the body is short for ""Hey, Some Of It Is Personal Though, Okay?""
T-Rex: And a third ""h""?
Utahraptor: ""Hooray for the Huxtables.""
Narrator: NOTE FOR FUTURE PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THIS COMIC:
T-Rex: The Huxtables were a family on a TV show. TV is what we had before we got video in our brains! And everyone who read this comic when it first came out was really great, even if we're all dead now.

T-Rex: That too shall pass!
Utahraptor: Normally the saying is only applied to BAD things, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It applies to all things!

T-Rex: ""Oh yeah? Well here in the REAL world, WE don't get to rest for 32 bars!""
T-Rex: Hee hee! It's funny, Dromiceiomimus, because sometimes in a song musicians get to rest for 32 bars, while here in the real world, we don't get to do that because we're not, um - trained musicians.
Dromiceiomimus: I got that, yeah! It seems like it would only work on a musician who's lazy though, right? Or who's insulting you about being lazy?
T-Rex: IT WILL WORK ON ALL MUSICIANS. Just you wait!
Utahraptor: Do you even know any musicians, T-Rex?
T-Rex: I will soon!
Utahraptor: I see! You're going to befriend some musicians, purely for the hope that one day one of them will turn out to be a jerk and insult you and then you can use your elaborate zinger on them!

Utahraptor: I don't see why you're making fun of Doug!
T-Rex: He talks like a 1920s villain!
Utahraptor: So, whatever! He talks like he's a 1920s serial villain. We all have idiolects. For example, you're a man who says ""dude"" and ""awesome"" in places where he could instead simply say ""chap"" and ""I say, that's quite agreeable.""
T-Rex: Yeah, but chap, you know what I don't say?
T-Rex: I don't say, ""He slumbers still? Alack! One thousand curses! When the Sandman's spell at last lies vanquished at his feet, give him good heed: Doug has come calling.""

Dromiceiomimus: But - there's no particular flavour of Irish evil, T-Rex! It's absurd!

Dromiceiomimus: Did the person hand it in like that?
T-Rex: Nope! I got caught but we agreed it was awesome.
Utahraptor: I would like some more examples from this prank!
T-Rex: And I am only too happy to provide them!
T-Rex: To see for yourself, all you have to do is go to the Wikipedia article on evil and do the replaces there. Hah hah! My comedy ONCE AGAIN trumps the desires of those who would seek useful information about evil!

Utahraptor: I'm gonna say... yes?
T-Rex: Okay!
T-Rex: Well, then I guess I'm creepy, because I totally did those things. I stole a glass because someone I'd seen on TV touched it. I didn't know I was that sort of creeper, Utahraptor, but here we are.

Utahraptor: Are you serious about this, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Somewhat to moderately!
Utahraptor: Well, there are many ways of living, but those are lifestyle choices, not truths! All you're really doing is applying the label of truth to circumstances, desires and trends. The truths you're looking for are more universal, aren't they?

Dromiceiomimus: And this coloured your emotions in the morning, and whatever you thought of seemed to be a little worse because of it? I've had that too!
T-Rex: Exactly. Sucks to that!
Utahraptor: Maybe it's the whole butterfly dreaming he's a dinosaur thing, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Perhaps literally!!

Utahraptor: Yep!
Utahraptor: You're a mass of bones and meat with needs and desires, of course that's affected who you are! If I wasn't bones and meat with needs and desires myself, I'd be SHOCKED the system even works!
T-Rex: I need and desire you to stop describing my body that way.

Narrator: T-REX LOVES OUT-OF-GENRE COVER SONGS
Narrator: they're great
T-Rex: They're great because say you love a particular hip hop song, but wouldn't you love it EVEN MORE if it was an opera? Yes, you would! Also, wouldn't you love arias ten times better as gangsta rap songs? Here again, the answer is yes. I don't know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended, but I accept it, and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form!
Utahraptor: Isn't it just the novelty of it that appeals to you though?
T-Rex: That's part of it, true!
T-Rex: I like the feeling of looking in on an alternate universe: that sense of familiarity, altered but recognizable. But even without it, some are just really great songs that stand on their own!
Utahraptor: Let's listen to one! Give me your absolute favourite.

You have to risk the embarrassment and just ask: the worst they can say is ""no""! And then they can get really freaked out and not want to be your friend anymore.
T-Rex: It can get pretty bad and embarrassing, I gotta say!
T-Rex: But it's a risk you've got to take, as there exists, unfortunately, no secret word for sexy times.
Dromiceiomimus: What are you talking about? Yes there is. Nobody told you?
T-Rex: What?
Dromiceiomimus: Oh my god. Forget I said anything.
T-Rex: Holy crap. There IS a way to ask for threesomes and not risk anything?
Utahraptor: No, no!
Utahraptor: There totally isn't. If there WAS such a secret word, then everyone would be having some really fun and satisfying weekends!
T-Rex: How was your weekend, Utahraptor?
Utahraptor: Oh, really fun and sa- um, I mean... ""boring""?
Utahraptor: Boring is a thing weekends used to be, right?

T-Rex: Ah!
Devil: ON ONE HAND THESE GAMES APPEAL TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE STANDARD GAMING DEMOGRAPHIC AND THUS SERVE TO BROADEN THE APPEAL OF THE MEDIUM AND DISPEL SOME NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES ABOUT THOSE WHO PARTAKE OF INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
Devil: ON THE OTHER HAND THE CASUAL MARKET IS SO BIG THAT IT MAY ENCOURAGE FRANCHISES I ENJOY TO BECOME MORE CASUAL FRIENDLY AND THIS OFTEN UNFORTUNATELY MEANS MORE SHALLOW
T-Rex: I really haven't thought about industry ramifications of casual gaming that much!
Utahraptor: Me neither!
T-Rex: No, I - I was talking to the Devil. He's concerned that casual gaming could eclipse the parts of the market he identifies with.

T-Rex: What's a clockwork universe?
Utahraptor: That's where everything runs itself!
Utahraptor: So the universe is deterministic, running without outside management - like a clock! God invents the laws of physics, sets everything in motion and then relaxes as the clock runs forever. Maybe he brushes his hands off and says ""I'm goin' on infinite break"".
T-Rex: INTERESTING.

T-Rex: Large corporations will turn to these forecasters and say ""what colours should we make dresses in the future"" and they'll say ""for a million dollars, I will tell you"" and then they pay a million dollars because nobody wants to make dresses in the wrong colour! Nobody has ever wanted that!!

Evidence of fantastic creatures and powers, used only once, and resulting only in self-destruction.

T-Rex: It lasted only two hours.

T-Rex: Specifically, trapdoor functions are SUPER interesting! Times two!
T-Rex: These are functions that are easy to compute but difficult to reverse-engineer - unless you have the secret 'trapdoor' information. For example, the product of two prime numbers (p and q) is not hard to figure out if you know their values (it's just multiplication!), but if all you have is the answer, n, guessing what p and q are can take a really long time.
T-Rex: And yeah, functions like this are a basis of cryptography!
Utahraptor: How's that?
T-Rex: Well, say I send n to you, and you know what the secret value of p is. There's a chance my message might be intercepted by a bad guy. But this dude will only know n, not p!
Utahraptor: So I'll be able to figure out q easily, knowing what n and p are, but this guy will be totally stumped!

T-Rex: YOU, dear friend, owe me like three cases of pop, because you bet me a can of pop for every week the sub place stayed open, and they've been open for years, so yes, many soda pops for me.
Utahraptor: That is such a made-up bet! I owe you zero cases of pop.

They take over a lane of traffic and get to set their pace. The motto and politics are ""we don't block traffic, we are traffic!""
T-Rex: It's good times, if you're not in a car!
T-Rex: I find it encouraging when I see a bunch of bikes taking over a road and just going on their way. The noise of traffic is replaced by the softer sound of spokes and gears. It's pretty neat!
Dromiceiomimus: But what about important vehicles, like ambulances and so on?
T-Rex: Oh, they still pull over to let those through. They just don't let cars merge in with the bikes because it's DANGEROUS.
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, is it not ENTIRELY TRUE that these rides are illegal?
T-Rex: Depends on who you ask, dude!
T-Rex: And where you live, I suppose. I don't know! I know I like to ride bikes, and I believe they're as entitled to the road as cars. The end!

594,"utahraptor's pretty sure that for life to exist, chemical reactions have to be deterministic, because otherwise we could all explode when we ate a sandwich or something, kapow!",,"T-Rex: Science is based upon hypotheses, conclusions and theories formed via repeated observations and experiments!
Narrator: THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF SCIENCE
T-Rex: This allows us to fashion an empirical and verifiable understanding of the world around us. Theories are said to be correct if they match up with the observed properties of the universe! However, science makes the tacit assumption that the universe is predictable and orderly and regular, which MAY NOT BE THE CASE.
T-Rex: I ask the question: what if some of the theories and laws of science were merely statistical?
Utahraptor: Explain!
T-Rex: Well, we say the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, because it's been that every time we've measured it. But what if there's a small chance that sometimes, the speed of light can just - change?
Utahraptor: You're questioning the basis of science by postulating a non-deterministic universe.

T-Rex: I would argue: no!
T-Rex: In the second example, there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered, while in the first, this is not necessarily the case! And this applies not just to butter: there are many other examples. For instance, “Gary wrote for many TV shows” leaves open the possibility of a co-author on the scripts, a possibility that “Gary wrote many TV shows” does not!
Utahraptor: Wow! These small changes in semantics (the meaning of a word or phrase) are quite interesting!
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: But hard, too.
T-Rex (punchline): Agreed.

GOOD FRIGGIN' LUCK.,,"T-Rex: In Grand Theft Auto, you can walk up to any car, open the door, and steal it! This is because nobody ever locks their car doors in Grand Theft Auto. The only question is...
T-Rex: why?
God: SAYS HERE IT'S BECAUSE OF GAMEPLAY CONCERNS
T-Rex: You are fired!
T-Rex: We need an IN-UNIVERSE EXPLANATION - and I have performed this feat! Consider the universe of GTA: much like ours, except for a single individual who is FUNCTIONALLY IMMORTAL. Police arrest him, he walks free. If he's shot / exploded / whatever, hospitals will restore him to perfect health no matter how bad the damage is: even if he jumps from an exploding helicopter and lands on another exploding helicopter!
Utahraptor: But that's impossible! We don't have that expertise!
T-Rex: I KNOW!
T-Rex: The hospitals aren't repairing him, friend: HE'S NOT GETTING HURT. He is a fallen god who has forgotten his true nature and whose exposure to mortals has made him chaotic, unpredictable. Everyone goes along and pretends he's a mortal too, hoping it will save them.

T-Rex (punchline): It gets sadder! Sometimes I imagine he's bought books on how to get your kid to floss, and he's tried everything the books say but still, I don't floss - and he's started to wonder if there is something wrong with HIM.

T-Rex: I call this condition ""Appetite Asperger's""!
T-Rex: It is a hilarious AND excellent name because people with Appetite Asperger's analyze the behaviour of others while eating and come up with a ruleset for saying when they're full.

It's December now, isn't it?
T-Rex: It's DEFINITELY time for me to fix the great works of fiction!
T-Rex: The great out-of-copyright works of fiction, anyway. My brilliant idea is to completely recontextualize them through the magic of framing stories! So for example, instead of Moby Dick being about this guy after a whale, it's this CRAZY SCIENTIST writing whaler fan fiction, and at the end, the scientist stops and says ""Sheesh, I didn't mean to write so much whaler fan fiction.""
Utahraptor: And Moby Dick takes place in the middle?
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: And Pride and Prejudice is still this fancy romance story, but now it's framed by this dude being asked to describe the ultimate video game, and at the end the dude says ""Anyway after that it becomes a turned-based strategy game with a focus on resource management"".

T-Rex: Everyone? Why, THAT'S JUST WHAT I EXPECTED!
T-Rex: Greek fire was a flammable liquid that burnt on water and that could only be extinguished by burying it in sand! The Byzantines used it to gain an advantage in all sorts of wars, and they kept it such a secret that eventually they forgot how to make it too. Awesome! Damascus steel was SO STRONG that people claimed its swords could cut through other swords - but the technique used to make it is lost, and the raw materials used are long gone. OH WELL!!
T-Rex: And that's just the stuff we know about!
Utahraptor: It's true!
T-Rex: There's probably tons of other stuff that we've not only forgotten, but that we've also forgotten we've forgotten! Maybe in the past it was all hoverboards and space helmets and cavemen saying ""Hey, let's NOT write this down okay??""

T-Rex: Ah, Dromiceiomimus, that's actually ""better at it than I"". An easy way to remember the difference is to include the ""to be"" verb you're dropping: ""better at it than I am"" sounds right, while ""better at it than me am"" does not! Easy!
Utahraptor: Geez, that was kind of rude, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It wasn't meant to be!

T-Rex: Money is an aberration that lessens us all! We don’t need it!
Utahraptor: But without money, people would still trade!
T-Rex: And...?
Utahraptor: AND, currency is just an abstraction of trade: a unit of exchange! One unit of currency equals three goats, for example. Some form of money develops naturally from trade and is thus, I think, pretty much inevitable!

Dromiceiomimus: I'd give up taste, because smell is good to warn you of fires!
T-Rex: Yeah but so's sight, and I can ALSO use sight to check out women, and dictionaries.
Utahraptor: I'm surprised at you, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really? Why's that?
Utahraptor: You're basically sticking to the canonical five senses! I would have bet the first sense you'd give up is your sense of EMPATHY, or your sense of what's appropriate to say in social situations.
T-Rex: Hah! MAN. I would love to give up that sense! Can you imagine?

T-Rex: Everyone knows that the 1920s were awesome ultimate fun times (on account of flappers and swing music!), and everyone knows that the 1970s were a decade of bad decision after bad decision: a cacophony of just - really bad decisions.

But if you ARE the centre of the Universe, then everything's revolving around you! You can go through time without worry, because you'll always arrive right where you started.
T-Rex: Oh, wow! This means that if we can travel through time, then we can also SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE whether or not someone is actually the centre of the Universe.

Narrator: KIDS SERIOUSLY DO THIS AT HOME
Narrator: NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN
T-Rex: I have always been a fan of writing ""stop following me"", just because I love the idea of a guy who is being followed by someone, and then get SO PISSED OFF that he spins around, whips out his chequebook, and cuts the dude a cheque then and there just to make him go somewhere else.
Dromiceiomimus: I sometimes write ""for your continued silence""!
T-Rex: Also gold! Especially if it's a cheque for like, 37 cents.
Utahraptor: You guys never write things like ""October rent""?
T-Rex: Apparently not dude!
T-Rex: Although I have written things like ""nudity tax"" when I didn't want the person to cash the cheque.
Utahraptor: ""Non-negotiable"" works in those situations too.
T-Rex: TOO EASY, man! Seriously, you should join us in our wacky cheque world. It's great!

It's also excellent because you can build statues out of it. Statues perhaps, of...

Dromiceiomimus: That's actually not a bad idea, T-Rex! If you want something to last a long time in the environment, copper's a great material. Put it underwater and it'll last even longer.
T-Rex: That's what I'm saying! A copper statue of me could last MILLIONS of years, even with nobody taking care of it!
T-Rex: Millions of years, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: That IS plenty of years!

T-Rex: One telegram, please!!
Dromiceiomimus: Can you still send non-singing and stripping telegrams? I thought email had basically replaced them.
T-Rex: Not hardly! Telegrams were better because they made you go to the door to get them, which meant folks knew you were popular AND getting an important message. Plus they charged by the word so people were concise! Also I think you had to write ""STOP"" instead of a period so the messages were rad, stop.
Utahraptor: Hey, I'll send you a telegram, T-Rex!

Utahraptor: While individuals may be fragile, species can survive a very long time! Why not see individual lives as single cells in the species: a multi-cellular multi-generational organism?

T-Rex: Proprioception!
Utahraptor: And you really want to be CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED about where your limbs are when you can't see them?
T-Rex: Maybe!
Utahraptor: You know what? I don't think you would! I think you ACTUALLY chose proprioception because it's not one of the classical five senses, and you wanted to be Mr. ""Look At Me Guys I Chose An Unexpected Answer"".

Utahraptor: I guess the old stereotype of boys liking trains is true!
T-Rex: Come on, that's dumb!

T-Rex: So if I say ""the atomic mass of xenon is 131.3 AMU"", a response of ""Oh, maybe it is for YOU!"" is a fallacy. But if I said ""toast is the ultimate breakfast-time treat"", you could very well respond with ""maybe for YOU, not for ME"" and it wouldn't be a fallacy, because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal.
Utahraptor: Who are you explaining the relativist fallacy to?
T-Rex: Oh, just God!
T-Rex: He was asking me what the weight of xenon was and I was all ""Duh, 131.3 AMU"" and he was all ""Duh, maybe for you, T-Rex"" and I was all, ""Aha! Time to pontificate!"" Then I worked in an example about toast.
T-Rex and Utahraptor: HEY! Let's go get some toast!
T-Rex (punchline): It all comes back to toast!

784,(t-rex calls his mind the vault),,"T-Rex: Am I doing the right thing with my life? What if what I'm doing with my time is actually something I will one day regret? What I NEED is some way to measure regret for every action and career path.
Narrator: TWO SECONDS LATER:
T-Rex: Done and DONE!
T-Rex: All I'll need to do is ask old people about their lives, and measure how many of them regret certain things! This ""regret index"" will range from 0 (no regret) to 1 (total ultimate regret). With it, I can tell kids today that if you rub spider eggs into your eyes, you're 96% likely to regret it, but if you drink delicious lemonade and pop wheelies, the regret index on that is near 0!
Label: [with an arrow pointing at the house] LOG CABIN: REGRET INDEX .24

Utahraptor: So basically you're just asking people what they liked and what they didn't like?
T-Rex: Yeah!
T-Rex: But ""regret index"" makes it sound more scientific. I honestly think this could be useful! You could find out how many people are still happy that they memorized every Star Trek episode!

Narrator: DON'T LOOK A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH:
T-Rex: Originally this expression was ""don't look any horse in the mouth"", as the inside of the average horse's mouth is a maddening, insanity-inducing nightmare of impossible angles and non-Euclidian geometry. With the invention of equine orthodontics, the expression was modified to ""GIFT horse"", gift being an acronym for ""Granting Insanity From Teeth"".
Dromiceiomimus: Of course!!

T-Rex: Originally, tangos involved groups of three people!
Utahraptor: Or more!
T-Rex: This was before mass media, so when the dance was altered, catchy idiom was used to popularize the change!

Utahraptor: Why all this talk about self-doubt, T-Rex? Are YOU self-doubting?
T-Rex: Hah, of course not!
T-Rex: Besides, if I was, it would be self-skepticism, not self-doubt. Doubt can be irrational and unfounded, but skepticism relies on a critical evaluation of the facts at hand, and an informed judgment of their merit.

Utahraptor: Sounds like a good analogy to me!
T-Rex: But it's totally not!

T-Rex: It's 10.
T-Rex: I just said.
T-Rex: Ten.
Utahraptor: So what's 2+2 decimal, answering in base pi?
T-Rex: EASY! In decimal that's 4, so that's about 1.3 of a pi -
T-Rex: So in ""pi-imal"" it would be around 10.2? Approximately? Look, it's gonna take an infinite number of digits to represent the answer.

T-Rex: Once upon a time there was a scary ghost! He was so terrifying that if you gazed at him you'd DIE.
T-Rex: And at present, he was learning about pine trees!
T-Rex: ""There are over 100 different species of pine trees"", he read. ""But scientists have discovered that really there's just three main kinds. One thing all pine trees have in common is that they don't lose their leaves during winter! That makes them very special trees. We call them 'evergreen'.""
T-Rex: The ghost realized that this book was way beneath his reading level.
Utahraptor: So he picks up a more advanced book?
T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR let me tell the story!!

T-Rex: The first issue is fifty million dollars is a LOT of dollars, especially just to give squirrels a place of worship. The second issue is, do squirrels even have spiritual lives?
Dromiceiomimus: More importantly, do they even have spiritual lives that correspond with the church you're building?
T-Rex: Frig, I don't even know if squirrels can conceptualize their own death!!
Utahraptor: The question is, is self-awareness truly necessary for spirituality AND IF SO, do squirrels have it?
T-Rex: Who knows?!

2452,VAMPIRES you should be DISCLOSING that you are in a BORROWED BODY,,"T-Rex: One of the main advantages of brain transplants (or body transplants, depending on how you look at it!) is you get a fun new bod that's not like your old one. But one of the main issues is scar tissue!
T-Rex: Scarred nerve tissue doesn't transmit signals well!
T-Rex: So even if you got a brain transplant without dying, you'd end up being left in a body you couldn't move. This, my friends, is SUBOPTIMAL. Also, the brain is a super sensitive organ and gets damaged really quickly if it doesn't get oxygen. Therefore, brain transplants: super hard. We've never pulled one off here in the mortal world. But what if you had a brain that didn't NEED oxygen? What if you had a body that didn't FORM scar tissue?
Utahraptor: Vampires?
T-Rex: VAMPIRES.
T-Rex: It's EASY to do a vampire/vampire brain transplant! And since their bodies won't reject any foreign materials, you can just wire up nerves manually with like, tungsten. It'll take time but who cares? It's not like your patients can DIE.

T-Rex: Anyway, Gregor MacGregor was this explorer adventurer guy in the 1800s!
T-Rex: In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England, with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30,000 km² of land! The land was incredibly fertile, the natives helpful, and he'd already established an army, banks, civil service AND democracy there. You couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground, and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate!!
Utahraptor: You're describing the FICTIONAL nation of Poyais, T-Rex! That was a huge scam!
T-Rex: It - what?
Utahraptor: When the colony boats arrived, instead of opera houses they found untamed jungle, tropical disease and venomous snakes. One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage. By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London, 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED.

T-Rex: And it's a tricky issue! Giving money to beggars can be helpful, but some feel it encourages bad behaviour and undermines the work of social support organizations. Plus there is always the rumour of beggars who take home hundreds of dollars a day! On the other hand, there may well be people for whom begging is the only means of support they have.
Utahraptor: You're sure using a lot of qualifiers there, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's intentional!
T-Rex: I really don't know much about panhandling, and a lot of people feel very strongly about it. I don't know! I usually try to learn more about things by doing them, but if I panhandled I'd be a total poseur.

Utahraptor: I don't owe you any money, T-Rex!
T-Rex: You owe me 30 clams! 30 BUCKAZOIDS.

THIS emotion is for when you're nostalgic for a time you were never alive in, like when a chick is nostalgic for the time of pirates! Or, when a dude misses being a 16th century courtesan.
T-Rex: It also happens when folks spend a lot of time wishing they could be Shakespeare's Pal!
Dromiceiomimus: But you can't really invent a new emotion-
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, let me just stop you there. If you're going to say that emotions are FELT, not invented, and that as I couldn't ""invent"" gravity so too can I not invent a feeling, but merely observe and perhaps label it, then that is a good point that I should have considered myself.
Dromiceiomimus: Alright!
Utahraptor: So what's this specific breed of nostalgia called?
T-Rex: Protonostalgia!
T-Rex: Protonostalgia is a proper subclass of nostalgia. It's a new feeling for a new generation.
Utahraptor: But ""proto"" implies ""before"" - couldn't there be a better name for this?
T-Rex: Perhaps your opinions will change... when you check out my ULTRASWEET poster!

2236,"No one would have believed in the first years of the twenty-first century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by mangas; that as we busied ourselves about our various concerns we were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a scientist with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.",,"T-Rex: A woman trips, falls, hits her head. You run up to offer help, but instead of blood, thick black manga seeps out of the wound. The woman turns her head unnaturally towards you and smiles. There's too many teeth in her mouth. Too many mangas.
T-Rex: You turn to run, hating the strange, corrupt part of you that wants to stay!
T-Rex: Glancing behind, you see her body skittering towards you, crawling on all fours, her limbs at impossible, horrifying angles. A slick wet trail of mangas coats the pavement behind her. You run, but everyone you pass turns to chase you too. The entire town has been changed - taken - by the mangas. The townsfolk surround you, and as you stare into their eyes you see only mangas staring back at you, vast and cool and unsympathetic.
T-Rex: They open their mouths, too wide, mangas spewing out onto the ground in a heap.
Utahraptor: They ignore your screams.
T-Rex: You're pushed into the twitching pile of mangas, your feet and hands making contact with the gelatinous mass. They spiral up your limbs, and then you feel manga pushing past your lips. The mangas are moving inside you now. You can feel yourself ending. You -

T-Rex: Not as such.

1496,"""I puked up the story of how I came to be in Venice: it was a metaphor involving vomit, one of the untold millions that pepper this narrative.""",,"T-Rex: If you're going to write a book, you need an opening line! And what possible opening line could be better than ""Hey there readers - what's the score, I guess I'm gonna write this book some more!""
T-Rex: BEST OPENING EVER.
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure it's the best! Much more famous openings include ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" and ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I didn't say ""famous""! I said BEST. My opening line is way better than those despite its (relative) obscurity!
Utahraptor: There are still way better opening lines that are relatively unknown!
T-Rex: Nope!
Utahraptor: I give you the first line of Max Shulman's ""Sleep Till Noon"": ""Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Four shots ripped into my groin and I was off on the greatest adventure of my life!""
T-Rex: Hah hah! Awesome. Okay, THAT one's tied for first. With me.
Narrator: SOON:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, can you help me write a whole story based around one fantastic opening line?
Off panel: Depends; what's the line?

Off panel: I'm sure there's not a BILLION of them, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Hah!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, just recently this dude was found dead with shards of glass in his heart! You know what happened? His new lava lamp was taking TOO FRIGGIN' LONG to warm up, so he put it on his stove and heated it, and it got too hot and exploded on him and he died.
Dromiceiomimus: Whoah! That's terrible.
T-Rex: I know! And I'm not the only one who heard that story and thought, ""Wow; glad he got the lava lamp before I did.""
Utahraptor: A man died, T-Rex! That's not funny!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I'm not joking!
T-Rex: I truly believe I could've been the one who died. The sort of thing he did is exactly the sort of thing you do when you're home alone and frustrated with a lava lamp! You SOLVE PROBLEMS.
Utahraptor: And sometimes you die.
T-Rex: Yes! But we recognize that one dies so that others may live.
T-Rex: By we, I mean of course the membership of the People Who When They Hear A Story About An Avoidable And Crazy Death, Laugh As Is Expected Of Them And Then Make A Mental Note To Not Do That Thing Anymore.

2336,And a very merry [REDACTED] to us all.,,"Narrator: CASE FILE #1024 THE SLED
T-Rex: Thank you all for coming: I remind you this meeting is classified. This briefing is about a superficially ordinary cargo sled under the control of Case #1023, usually used on Christmas Eve.
T-Rex: This sled allows access to millions of complicit families, all within a single 24-hour period!
Dromiceiomimus: While the reasons for these visits remain classified - thankfully obscured by constructed myth - the method used for them can be shared with you today: Agents, this Sled allows for selective logical addition of quantum realities. Put simply: elements of alternate timelines can be merged into our own.
T-Rex: If you choose 100 randomly-selected houses to deliver presents to -
Utahraptor: - then there's an alternate reality where 100 different houses were chosen!
T-Rex: Precisely. Doctor?
Utahraptor: Subject interfaced with the Sled can selectively collapse those realities into ours, which results in a final timeline in which every good little girl and boy gets a present.
T-Rex: When ""Rudolph"" went against ""Frosty"" this afternoon, he failed. But we were able to use the Sled. And now, he was successful.
T-Rex: But overwriting the trillions of timelines in which we failed with our only victory led to some side-effects, including 175,250,000 alternative ""Rudolph"" corpses that materialized in a fused-together mound near the North Pole.
T-Rex (punchline): Cleanup duty begins at 0800. Dismissed!

T-Rex: Always!
T-Rex: It would be SO COOL to see how things work out. Wouldn't you agree, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: I guess!
T-Rex: Also, I'd take back future technology with me and claim it as my own invention.
Utahraptor: You can't do that, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Says you!
Utahraptor: Says LOGIC. Think about it: if you did that, then where did the idea for the invention come from? You didn't have it, and now the future inventor won't have it either...
T-Rex: A paradox!
Utahraptor: Yes!

Is there nothing stopping me from making a light cannon, which, when fired, throws dudes up against the wall?
T-Rex: Weaponized photons!
Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex - photons don't have any mass, do they? If they had mass, wouldn't that mean that walking outside on a sunny day would mean being hit with trillions of tiny bullets, reducing everything to a red, pulpy, well-lit paste?
T-Rex: But then how do solar sails work? And photon engines? Don't they work by photons pushing against things? HAS SCIENCE FICTION BEEN LYING THROUGH ITS SCIENCE TEETH??
Utahraptor: Maybe even without mass, photons can still exert pressure!
T-Rex: Perhaps!!
T-Rex: And if solar sails work, THEN SO TOO WILL MY LIGHT CANNON! I'll just need tons of light.
Utahraptor: I think you'd need more than the entire output of the sun!

Devil: HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MALE GAZE
T-Rex: I have, actually! It's a film theory.
T-Rex: The idea is that the camera is situated by and for men!
T-Rex: Thus, we always see more of the woman's body than we do of the man's in film - the camera possesses the (heterosexual) male gaze, and thereby disenfranchises the woman by reducing her to the passive object of gaze, while the male is elevated to the active gazer. It is a NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL theory.
Devil: YES BUT
T-Rex: - but what about that as applied to video games?
Devil: UM
T-Rex: Wow, I never thought YOU'D be interested in this male gazey stuff!
Utahraptor: Who'd be interested?

Utahraptor: I like the minotaur: head of a bull, body of a dinosaur!
T-Rex: No doubt, it's a rad beast!

T-Rex: That's not really surprising, I guess, since every language EVER has been spoken by people who once were alive and are now totes dead. Similarly, every language has concepts of ""male"" and ""female"", which suggests that we, as a people, find naughty bits interesting!

T-Rex: Maybe ""cheapened"" is too strong a word, but it's now - routine? Predictable? Now if we've made a big mistake we can't say ""My God! What have I done?"" because it's too cliché: we either have to acknowledge that or reach for another way to express it. IN CONCLUSION AND IN SUMMARY, the highest experiences life can offer have already been acted out for us, cheapened by imitation and reference instead of experienced firsthand!
Utahraptor: Do you really feel this way?
T-Rex: Sometimes! Especially when I get angry.
T-Rex: It's just that - it can be hard to have a meaningful conversation when you're dancing around all these clichés.
Utahraptor: Well, actually, that's one of the things that first attracted me to you: your ability to IGNORE popular culture, your willingness to talk as if nobody's listening.

That riddle is so old-school, the techniques necessary for modern school construction won't be invented for two thousand years.

T-Rex: Okay guys! Whatever!
T-Rex: The trouble I have with primitivism is the half-assed way it's always evoked: it's this simplified idea of ""primitive"" cultures, where some things get highlighted while a lot of detail gets ignored or obliterated completely. All the women were totally topless and all the men wore body paint and hunted with spears! Life was good in the forest!
T-Rex: Primitivism has this strange semi-positive racism attached to it too.
Utahraptor: Semi-positive?
T-Rex: Yeah! You exaggerate traits as you often do with racism, but you make them positive things instead of negative. Natives were better because they were all stoic and noble and loved Mother Nature. Okay, great, but what if you're native and you're not like that?

T-Rex: But, it has also been SAD.
T-Rex: We've all changed! It makes me nostaligic for how things were before, just a year or two ago. Not because things were better, but because they were different! I always feel like I missed some opportunity, like I could have done something then that I can't do now.
Utahraptor: It's over now!
T-Rex: I know!
T-Rex: But I feel like everyone - all of us - could have done so much then, if only we hadn't spent so many nights at home watching a movie, or sitting in front of a computer!

T-Rex: I guess I was young and believed no woman could ever find me attractive of her own volition!
Utahraptor: Still - pretty bad!

Utahraptor: So toughness equals manliness then? Success is a male attribute now??

T-Rex: At its core, it refers to a control system that adjusts itself to feedback!
T-Rex: Let's say I want my room to be at a comfortable, yet classy, 22 degrees Celsius. If I design a system that repeatedly checks the temperature of the room and either turns on a heater or an air conditioner as needed, then OH SNAP. I'VE JUST BUILT A CYBERNETIC SYSTEM.

T-Rex: And if we view an air-conditioned room not as an empty space but as one half of a cyborg, then when I enter it, MY BODY is the other half. We join, marrying machine and flesh, working together to ensure my optimal comfort!
Utahraptor: And when you leave, you disconnect from the cybernetic machinery and become a regular dude!

T-Rex: Hah! Oh, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: Baseball isn't played because it's INTERESTING. Baseball is played because without darkness we would not appreciate the light: without sorrow, we would not appreciate joy.

T-Rex: Let's answer that question with terrible, hard-earned experience!
T-Rex: So first we should decide what kind of a food we want to eat, basing it on previous foods we've enjoyed. For example, I like to eat ice cream and meat.
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe some meat-themed frozen confection?
T-Rex: That sounds like meat-themed frozen perfection!
Dromiceiomimus: Okay, good
T-Rex: First, get five pounds of ground beef!
Utahraptor: Then get five pounds of ice cream!
T-Rex: Fold the raw meat into the ice cream, and brown in a giant frying pan. The ice cream will melt, sugars will burn, and grease will float on top of it all. Will this taste good? WHO KNOWS??
Utahraptor: All I know is that you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs!

Now no cell in her body divided without her telling it to. It was a living nightmare; nobody could coordinate that many events without messing up.

Dromiceiomimus: I'm fine, T-Rex!

Dromiceiomimus: That's very apt, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Thanks!
Utahraptor: And - your metaphor includes stomping on women, somehow?
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: For you see, the woman represents years of build-up of grime and dirt. By stomping on her I illustrate cleaning power - not of any household cleaner, but of simply applying yourself!
Utahraptor: To her.
T-Rex: Yes! To grime and dirt!

Utahraptor: What are you so concerned about?

T-Rex: The ""dealer"" is the one who has to deal with these guys. He gives each adult some cards with numbers on them - as many as they want - and so that nobody gets any confusion in their li'l heads, the numbers are printed both rightside up and upside down on each card. The stupid adults then add up their numbers!

T-Rex: Then they're all the next contestants on... The Price Is Right!
T-Rex: The home edition, anyway.
Utahraptor: Explain!
T-Rex: They each use their cards to guess a secret number: the closest without going over wins a prize! But that was too confusing for them, so now the secret number's always 21. They guess a number WHOSE VALUE IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE, and yet they still mostly lose.
Utahraptor: Sounds depressing!
T-Rex: Yep! To counteract THAT, the remedial addition schools are full of fun flashing lights. They're called ""CASINOS"", short for ""Can't Add? Suck at Identifying Numbers? Over here, Suckers!""

T-Rex: I am the last son of the doomed planet of Krypton!
T-Rex: Found, adopted, and raised by the kindly Kent couple, who could not have a child of their own, I was taught about Truth, Justice, and the American Way!
T-Rex: As I grew, I found I could run faster than a speeding bullet! I was more powerful than a locomotive! I was able to leap tall buildings in a single bound (as so)!
T-Rex: In times of trouble, I am there, as SUPERMAN!
Utahraptor: Clark?!
T-Rex: No, I'm Superman! Clark Kent and I are two different people!
Utahraptor: Oh - ha ha! For a second there you looked like him, only without the glasses!
T-Rex: Ha ha ha!

407,"you can read 'talking' as a verb, but that's not what i meant, so it'd be cool if you didn't do that",,"T-Rex: So! Generalizations!
T-Rex: I don't understand them!
T-Rex: For instance, after being bit by three tigers, I'd start to generalize that maybe I shouldn't poke tigers, because then they'll bite me. But if I happened to meet three jerky citizens of a town, the same process could make me conclude that everyone there is mean! Or worse: what if I started generalizing across races? I'd be a big ol' racist!
Utahraptor: Well, there are valid and invalid generalizations, my friend!
T-Rex: Yeah, that's true!
T-Rex: But I guess what bothers me is that it seems you determine whether or not a generalization is valid by evaluating its conclusion, which in turn is based on your own prejudices!
Utahraptor: Well - it's hard to remove the ""human factor"" from any evaluation like this.
T-Rex: You mean the ""dinosaur factor"", of course!
Off panel: Hah hah! Of course!
T-Rex (punchline): We're talking dinosaurs!
"
945,"if you don't rescue me then i'm gonna get cheesed off, okay?",,"T-Rex: The essential problem with Superman, as a character, is that he's too powerful and incorruptible. He's a walking deus ex machina! You give him a foe he can't beat, and all he has to do is TRY HARDER, and then he beats the guy.
T-Rex: What I'm saying is that this is not truly satisfying!
T-Rex: The way to make Supes interesting is to put him up against a problem that he can't fix by punching someone through a building! Put him in a situation where, say, everyone he loves starts dying of a disease that he can't detect or cure, passing away in his arms, one by one. At the end he's left as the sole survivor of the doomed planet Earth, six billion dead - only this time, he had a chance to stop the disaster, and he FAILED.
Utahraptor: That's a terrible story, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's modern, AND dark!
Utahraptor: Yeah, and it destroys the character! Superman is a symbol of hope, and you have him basically standing up and shouting ""HOPE IS USELESS AGAINST A SUPERIOR FOE"" and then everyone on Earth dies.
T-Rex: I bet if Superman were real he'd like my story. He'd say to me, ""That was a SUPER interesting story, T-Rex!""

T-Rex: Okay, I get that you're using Twitter! SUPER. But I really don't get why we need a new verb for that. All ""tweeting"" means is ""posting to Twitter"": it's got the same meaning as ""post"", except THIS verb can only be used in relation to a single corporate website. That's insane! Corporations invent nouns all the time, and I can accept that, but verbs? Really? Is updating Twitter SO DIFFERENT than updating any other website that we need a whole new word for it?
Utahraptor: Man this is old news, Professor Curmudgeonly! You ever seen something escalate?
T-Rex: Sure have!
Utahraptor: OH DAMN ""ESCALATE"" IS A VERB MADE UP FROM ""ESCALATOR"", WHICH WAS ITSELF A TRADEMARK! So now you can't escalate. And you also can't zip up your pants. Or go trampolining, rollerblading, or jetskiing. Or tase your enemies.

Dromiceiomimus: Huh?
T-Rex: I'm just concerned that after I'm dead, folks will write books about me filled with sass!
Utahraptor: I think I've figured you out, my friend!
T-Rex: Explain!
Utahraptor: You WANT your actions analyzed. You want it because if a third party analyzes them, not only does that suggest they're interesting, but it also gives them intrinsic meaning: there must be something there worthy of analysis! You never have to worry about living a meaningful life if there's someone else to find meaning for you.

T-Rex: DID THEY??
T-Rex: Because if you accept that the world is a finite plane, then it's got limits, and what's at the edge of those limits? A vertical wall that goes down a few kilometres, and then what? Tree roots? Upside-down land? A place where owls rule the world like they don't even care?
Utahraptor: I'm not convinced that's fair, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yeah! Like, today, we think the universe is roughly spherical and finite. What's at the edge of the universe? A wall? Evil twins? We usually answer with ""nothing"", but I can see better informed but equally jerky people in the future making fun of us for this.

Dromiceiomimus: Um- why do you think you're a genius, T-Rex?
T-Rex: A few reasons! The main one is I heard that genius is the ability to come up with concepts that would otherwise have to be taught, and I'VE TOTALLY DONE THAT. Remember? Remember Punchette, The Power Punch Bear?
Dromiceiomimus: ...No?
T-Rex: Yeah you do! The bear with the punch... that punched other punches!!

Utahraptor: Wait, I'm confused. Are you worried about not being rich, or about drifting to the right?
T-Rex: Neither! Both?
T-Rex: I'm - I dunno. I guess I'm worried about only getting one shot at life and messing it up, or not making the best of it.

Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah, too late! Looks like being T-Rexian is using unpopular and out of favour slang for no reason!
T-Rex: Aw shoot! My eponym is a disaster!
Utahraptor: Plus it wouldn't even get used that often!
Utahraptor: The only time I can imagine using it is - well, when describing you.

Dromiceiomimus: What's wrong with ""He's at peace""? It's nice.
T-Rex: It's demeaning! It suggests that the whole point of life is to be at peace, like it's this goal that we should all achieve, and I'M kind of a screw up but at least I achieved it by dying! It's like telling the kids who came in last in a three-legged race that the REAL goal was just to finish.
Utahraptor: I think it's supposed to be taken in a ""his suffering is over"" sort of way.
T-Rex: Oh. Well. That makes more sense.
T-Rex: Did you at least like my comparison of life to a three-legged race?

T-Rex: I really don't think dreams are important?
T-Rex: I didn't think that MOST people thought that dreams were all that important, but I must be in the minority, because I keep seeing fiction that uses dreams as Very Significant Symbolism. And the worst is when stories end on these Significant Dreams, because in my mind, I'm thinking ""This is ridiculous; when will we get back to the real story? This is entirely irrelevant."" and then it's over and I think ""Oh. Huh.""
Utahraptor: You really can't get past your opinion on dreams?
T-Rex: I can't. Nor do I want to!

T-Rex: Nobody who's trying to lose weight wants to hear from the guy who shed pounds like they were a Hallowe'en costume... in July, or something. That is to say, ""quickly""?
T-Rex: The point is that dieting is about commiserating, and I'm the guy who shows up to the party saying ""guys, it's not hard"" and that my secret to weight-loss success is ""um, eating less.""

T-Rex: Wait, did I say ""awesome""?! I meant ""HOLY COW, SO TERRIBLE!""
T-Rex: They're stopping the flow of information to literally ask RANDOM STRANGERS what they think. The only way it'd be acceptable is if they prefaced these stupid segments with ""and now, here's what some strange folks on their way to do something better had to say!"" but THEY NEVER DO.
Utahraptor: It's not that bad, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's SO BAD.
T-Rex: It's not even scientific, because it's not close to a representative sample. It's just noise! From now on, whenever the news does this, I'm going to take it as saying ""We don't care about facts, just about burning through your finite lifespan! Hey, here's some guy who'd talk to us.""

960,"shakespeare you should have quotes around 'chicken' in that last line, shakespeare, what the hell",,"T-Rex: Allusion is a reference to a person, place, or thing in a piece of literature! Like when Picard mentions Moby Dick in Star Trek: First Contact?
Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator: ALLUSION
T-Rex: Allusions are pretty handy because they allow you to summarize potentially complex ideas with one succinct reference, essentially piggybacking on the brilliance of previously established works! HOWEVER, if the audience isn't familiar with the reference, the allusion fails and can seem weird or out-of-place.
Dromiceiomimus: Just like Oliver Brackenbury!!
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah hah!
Utahraptor: You sure have been summarizing literary techniques a lot lately!
T-Rex: Sure have!!
Utahraptor: Well - what's going on in your life beyond that? What's new? What's shakin' with the dude?
T-Rex: Um - I kinda realized that I'd like to have children one day? But I need to have a girlfriend for that first.

T-Rex: I'm even more awesome!!
T-Rex: And NOW let's say the escalator is long enough and smart enough that it increases its speed so that I never reach the bottom, and as my sliding speeds up, the escalator speeds up! I can now be EXTREMELY AWESOME FOREVER!
Dromiceiomimus: I'm not sure that's the case! Plus, friction would eventually make your butt catch on fire.
T-Rex: What?!
T-Rex: Can that actually happen?
Utahraptor: Everything burns, T-Rex!
T-Rex: EVEN BUMS?
Utahraptor: ESPECIALLY BUMS, when they're acting as a friction brake. I thought we covered this with your ""infinite skateboard"" idea?

Dromiceiomimus: Will there ever be a way to do that?
T-Rex: Insufficient data for meaningful answer!
T-Rex: Okay Utahraptor, now it's centuries later and you ask me the same thing.
Utahraptor: Okay, how do I reverse entropy?
T-Rex: Insufficient data for meaningful answer! Okay so trillions of years have gone by and we've spread across the universe and I've gotten more and more advanced. Soon all life merges with me and your question is the only one I could never answer. I spend timeless intervals pondering it, okay?

Narrator: ALL THE REST
Dromiceiomimus: But what about foreshadowing? Denouement? SYNECDOCHE?
T-Rex: All dead! Today's readers yawn in the face of foreshadowing! They wince when seeing ANY events that occur after the climax! They throw up a little when a part is used to represent the whole! You can tell when that's happened because you'll go to the library and hear ""Synecdoche?! bleggh""
Utahraptor: That's ridiculous! People use synecdoche all the time.
T-Rex: People throw up all the time too!
T-Rex: COINCIDENCE, UTAHRAPTOR?? Or something more?

1532,it is like the number one condition of me letting you use my bed,,"Narrator: EPISTEMOLOGY COMICS
T-Rex: If I say ""Guys, I know I'm rad"", what am I saying? What does it actually mean to KNOW something? Philosophers have struggled with this for ages!
T-Rex: Luckily the answer is super easy and they should have come up with it sooner!
T-Rex: Knowledge of anything, radness included, comes about if three conditions are met: that this thing is true, that I believe it to be true, and that I have a JUSTIFIED cause for this belief! Perhaps my justification of radness is that I've been shot out of a cannon onto a motorbike, which is extremely rad. When these three conditions are met, then I've got what's called a Justified True Belief, and that, my friends, is what knowledge is!
Utahraptor: Okay, so we're hanging out, and I say ""T-Rex, I'm gonna go nap in your bed.""
T-Rex: I say, ""Dude, feel free!""
Utahraptor: However, once in your room I startle a sleepy murderer, who without alarming you, quietly murders me, stuffs me in the closet, and then goes back to nappy times - in your bed!! A few minutes later you say ""Nice. An orange dude is sleeping in my bed"". Clearly, this is justified, and it may even be true.
Off panel: But only if the murderer was orange! Don't you see? It's sheer luck that this murderer was coloured to make your belief true. Are you really going to call random chance ""knowledge""?

T-Rex: I call shenanigans on that!! What are these 10 basic stories then?
Dromiceiomimus: Um, okay - boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy meets boy, girl meets girl, boy meets... plant...
T-Rex: THAT ONE IS NOT A REAL STORY.
Utahraptor: I think what Dromiceiomimus is saying is that there are forms!
T-Rex: Ridiculous!
T-Rex: All that means is that if you boil the story down to its most superficial aspect then, YEAH, you can connect it to ""Terminator II"". But then you might as well treat EVERY story as a sequel, prequel, or rewrite of ""Terminator II""!

T-Rex: Darn it! Is everything we do ultimately reduced to greed?
Utahraptor: What about LOVE?
T-Rex: No go: you expect it to make you feel good, so you could be doing it out of SECRET GREED. What if you and I are the last people left, and I give you a real nice cookie WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY cutting off my own head with giant scissors? That's kindness without good things coming to me, therefore there's no self-interest!

813,"this one goes out to all the brothers and mothers who have come up with ideas that can only make the world a worse place.  hey, here's to not implementing them!",,"T-Rex: I have come up with the worst idea ever, and it's so simple. All you have to do is combine online gambling with online role playing games!
T-Rex: The result will be a game to RUIN LIVES!
T-Rex: MMORPGs are already really popular and addictive - some people play them upwards of eight hours a day. Throw in a casino where you can not only win REAL money but also rare in-game items and experience points, and you've merged two addictions into one, feeding them into each other! It'll be a terribly effective way to make profits from those with addictive personalities.
Utahraptor: So people can bet in-game money to win real-life money?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: You'd allow bets like that, but balance it so, overall, you don't end up losing real money. The more you gamble, the better stats your characters get, and the more you play, the more chances you have to win in the casino. Both addictions encourage the other!
Utahraptor: It really is an awful idea, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Oh, I've got other awful ideas too! Like, a toy gun for children, but every one in twenty shots (on average) it actually fires a real bullet!

Utahraptor: It is essentially awesome, my friend!

T-Rex: It was a busy day for Jim Rifle!
T-Rex: Unfortunately for him, whenever a bird got shot by his rifle, the ghost of that bird came back to haunt him. Soon he was bothered by hundreds of birdghosts who all wanted revenge, which was understandable, since he shot 'em.
Dromiceiomimus: Jim Rifle is having a complicated time!
T-Rex: He sure is!
T-Rex: So to fix his problem, he invented a new rifle that shot ghosts!
Utahraptor: That was easy!
T-Rex: Sure, but it turns out that getting ghost-shot just pushed the birds into level 2 ghosthood, upping their interest in revenge geometrically. Also, they developed arms and a crude form of speech.
Utahraptor: Horrifying.
T-Rex: That's why Jim shot the level 2 ghosts some more!
T-Rex: Turns out the level 3s were basically well-adjusted people, and level 4 bird ghosts were beings of enlightened truth whose merest glance drew tears of joy. THE END. The moral of the story is, I'm not really sure how guns work?

And so they go to their neighbourhood BODY FARM, which is basically just a few acres of land surrounded by a fence and filled with DEAD AND DECOMPOSING BODIES. Some are out in the open, others are underwater or entombed or whatever! And scientists come and science up the joint, and I'LL get to be the guy who holds a torch under his face and says ""Welcome to my farm of death and decay.""
T-Rex: I'd only say that sometimes, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: You'd only say it never!
Utahraptor: There are tons of legal, ethical, and security issues you're not even considering!
T-Rex: ""Security issues""! What's better security than living in a house surrounded by CORPSES? ""Oh hey, let's go steal the TV from the corpse house""? NOBODY HAS EVER SAID THAT, UTAHRAPTOR!!

T-Rex: YES. Yes it probably would!
T-Rex: I mean, I get that depression (UNhappiness) has a host of issues associated with it, but what I'm describing is more Ahappiness - the ability to not need happiness at all! Happiness is this - this FUEL that we need to function in society, but it doesn't last forever, and then we need to find more. It's like food, only it's drained every time we have to do something sucky! Also, you can't buy happiness at a grocery store. I'm sorry, Safeway, but you just CAN'T.
T-Rex: But what if I removed that desire for happiness? What if instead of feeding the world, I simply killed hunger?
Utahraptor: T-Rex!
Utahraptor: This is crazy! You can't just pluck an emotion out of the psyche, and we don't have technology that even approaches this. When did you ever think you were going to do this?
T-Rex: ""Do this?"" Utahraptor, do you seriously think I'd explain my masterstroke if there was the slightest chance of you affecting its outcome?

Dromiceiomimus: Are you planning to sell these bags to people who want to turn every laundry day into a chance for arrest, AND ALSO to those nostalgic for the charming visual shorthands of early cartoons?
T-Rex: I am indeed! Or at least, I was indeed, until I realized that you could just make your own with just a little fabric paint and a working knowledge of what dollar signs look like.
Utahraptor: I actually think this has been done before, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Aw man, really?
T-Rex: I did kinda suspect it might've been done before, since it seemed like a really funny idea, but I've never seen any such laundry bags! I'll just claim to have INDEPENDENTLY invented them.

Guys, Mary had her own problems.
T-Rex: She was born with a disease where she only saw in black and white!
T-Rex: Also, she's spent her entire life in single black-and-white room equipped with a black-and-white computer screen. Despite this she's still super successful, and has learnt each and every piece of the physical information there is to learn about the neurophysiology of vision! She knows EVERYTHING about how colour works, how light interacts with the eye, and so on.
T-Rex: Good work, Mary!
Utahraptor: And then one day doctors cure her disease and let her out of the room!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: And the question is: when she first looks up at a beautiful blue sky and actually experiences colour for the first time - does she learn anything new?

Narrator: WHAT IF T-REX WERE A CHICK COMICS
Dromiceiomimus: You'd also have to deal with sexual prejudice, T-Rex! All your bragging about your sexual prowess and ""memorable lovemaking techniques"" would probably make people think you're kind of slutty!
T-Rex: No!
Dromiceiomimus: Yes! Some people, anyway.
T-Rex: But - I'm not slutty!
Utahraptor: Well, you talk like you are, sometimes!

T-Rex: This is most often seen when people play games of chance. They'll assume that, say, since they've had such bad luck with rolls of the dice recently, they are somehow ""due"" for a good roll!
T-Rex: However, in most cases things are independent. The result of the previous roll has no bearing on the current roll!

Despite the huge hole in her side, she could've remained afloat and motionless, if it weren't for the fact that nurses had opened portholes on the lower decks to get a breeze! Water flooded in as soon as the ship listed. As much as the Titanic is a symbol for hubris, the Britannic is a symbol of how SHIT GOES FOUL sometimes no matter how well you plan.
T-Rex: INTERESTING.
Utahraptor: The ship sank only a few miles from shore, didn't she?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: The captain actually gave the order to gun the engines and beach the ship on the shore, but some lifeboats were launched against orders, two of which ended up DRIFTING INTO THE PROPELLERS, with pretty much the results you'd expect.
Utahraptor: Holy smokes.
T-Rex: Yeah.
Narrator: THE MORAL OF THE STORY:
T-Rex (punchline): Shit certainly DOES go foul sometimes, you guys

T-Rex: Woooo!
Narrator: LATER:

740,i have almost no complaints about rare and brilliant moments of perfect self-awareness,,"Narrator: EPIPHANY COMICS
T-Rex: Friends are good things to have! They can help you out when you are sad (a psychological benefit), and can lend you money if you need it (an economic benefit)!
T-Rex: It is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me!
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure I like my friends because of the people they are, but what if I'm just kidding myself? What if I really just like them because they're an economic cushion - someone to bail me out, even literally, if I get into trouble?
Dromiceiomimus: Well - I mean, you'd do the same thing for us, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Exactly! We hedge our bets by having friends!
Utahraptor: There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: Okay - what about ""best friends forever"", the people in your life who you'll know will stand by you no matter what?
T-Rex: They are even MORE of an economic benefit! They are get out of jail free cards, people who you can rely on in any situation.
T-Rex: Wait!! My problem's that I'm seeing any positive effect of friendship as income, and thus everyone involved in one as compromised in a conflict of interest. I would only be happy if having friends was awful!
T-Rex (punchline): Thanks, rare and brilliant moments of perfect self-awareness!

1180,priorities change when you move from a gram to a kilogram.,,"T-Rex: I have a new problem. Now I have come into possession of several kilograms of Nazi memorabilia!
T-Rex: It - it came in the mail?
T-Rex: Somehow word got out that I am a Nazi Pin Guy and now I have everyone else's Nazi pins. And flags. And uniforms and boots and chapeaus. I basically have a WWII Re-Enactment Society in my basement, Dromiceiomimus. BUT ONLY FOR ONE SIDE.
Dromiceiomimus: Your problems just seem to - escalate, huh?
T-Rex: I wish I knew why
Utahraptor: Give it to a museum, T-Rex! They'll take it!
T-Rex: That's a great idea!
T-Rex: My pin was too common to interest a museum, but the rest of this stuff COULD be given away like that!
Utahraptor: Right, and you could probably find history teachers to take the more common artifacts!
T-Rex: Wow, all I have to do is follow your advice, and all my problems are solved!
Narrator: LATER:
Off panel: I don't understand why you're paying me to slip this Nazi memorabilia into the pockets of strangers.
T-Rex (punchline): Oh, I'm sorry, did I accidentally hire a PLAN CRITICIZER? I thought I was hiring a Reverse Pickpocket!
Off panel: I- I-
Off panel: i can do both
"
1381,"so anyway i can't think of single circumstance in which a verb form of ""sex"" cannot be gainfully replaced with a verb form of ""sexin'""",,"T-Rex: Okay so we've all evolved from lesser beings and in order to continue the species, we have a genetic imperative to reproduce!
T-Rex: And this is PROBABLY why sexin' is fun times!
T-Rex: And I'm told that when you hold your newborn child in your arms for the first time, this is a transcendental and joyous life-changing event. Sure, fine! I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU. But why are these pleasures just related to reproduction? Why can't I have the joy of having a child without actually HAVING to have the child?
T-Rex: It's my understanding that children are really expensive, you guys!!
Utahraptor: I don't see what kind of shortcut you're going for here!
T-Rex: Genetic engineering! It's SO EASY.
T-Rex: Let's just replace the biological imperative to reproduce! Let's give ourselves the same joy and wonder from an egg sammich as we get from first holding our child in our arms! Let's make gum as deeply fulfilling as watching your child graduate top of the class, Dean's list, summa cum laude. Bubblegum flavour.
Off panel: So your ideal future's one where everyone's weeping for joy over their Whoppers with Cheese, and nobody's having sex?
T-Rex: Who said anything about not having sex? The whole point is you can do both at the same time!
T-Rex (punchline): ""Boo hoo this is so tasty boo hoo hoo I'm also enjoying this sex as well""?

I invented the future perfect continuous passive, bitches!
T-Rex: AND I was the first to employ ""bitches"" as a generic intensifier, bitches!!
Utahraptor: Would you say you're... PAST TENSE with whoever corrected you?
T-Rex: This is no time for hilarious wordplay!
T-Rex: I need to recover my honour. I need the linguistic equivalent of a white glove to slap across someone's face, challenging them to a grammatical pop quiz to the death!
Utahraptor: You could thank them and correct your mistake.
T-Rex: NEVER! THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW GOOD I AM AT WORD STUFF.
Narrator: LATER, T-REX LEAVES A VOICEMAIL FOR THE PERSON WHO CORRECTED HIM:

Narrator: AND HE'S NAMED T-REX AS HIS SOLE BENEFICIARY!
T-Rex: WHAT?!
T-Rex: Oh God, I'm DEFINITELY going to jail, and it's all Utahraptor's fault! It's his revenge for all those arguments he lost!
Dromiceiomimus: How is naming you as beneficiary revenge?
T-Rex: Because when he dies, the police are going to ask ""Who stands to gain?"" and now there's a giant MILLION-DOLLAR ARROW pointing right to me, signed and notarized! Insurance policies are instant motive! JUST ADD DEATH!
Utahraptor: Well, what if I die of old age?
T-Rex: Still no good, my friend!
T-Rex: Your insurance company still saves a MILLION DOLLARS if they can somehow make it look like I murdered you. They'll be there, hands cupped around the policeman's ear, whispering ""Listen I am almost certain this green dude killed him and made it look like old age""
Utahraptor: I - okay?
Off panel: It's just I got the policy free through work, and I named you as a nice gesture? It doesn't even pay a million dollars. I'm pretty sure it's capped at $200,000.

Dromiceiomimus: Today I went to the - what do you call it, check it, one two, one two, one two, PHARMACY!
T-Rex: Perfect! Dromiceiomimus, your rapper name will be ""What's Up Drotimes"", ""Droseidon"", or ""Born Dromosexual"".
Dromiceiomimus: All quite reasonable names
Utahraptor: But there's more to it than saying ""check it, one two, one two""!
T-Rex: Yes! You also need FAT BEATS.
T-Rex: But fat beats are very hard to find when they're fresh, so I recommend you simply marry a beatboxer. They make the beats come out of their mouths!
Utahraptor: Do you... also recommend going to someone else for rap advice?
T-Rex: QUITE POSSIBLY?

From now on when I drop an anvil on my toe, this will be me:

T-Rex: Isn't it great, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: I just realized: I was living my life under the assumption that nobody had said ""Oh brother!"" since the fifties.
T-Rex: Well that is INCORRECT, as I said it this morning when I dropped my toast on the ground. ""Oh brother,"" I said, ""what's next??""
T-Rex: It was amazing

T-Rex: A complaint from Utahraptor? Oh, brother!!

And in heaven you get to live without suffering and all your old pets are there too. Geez. There may be dozens of pets running around. There's way more here than you can reasonably care for.
T-Rex: And THAT means you start having to choose favourites!
T-Rex: But that's kinda awful because OBVIOUSLY all the pets would want to be your favourite, and this is THEIR heaven too - so instead let's say your mind has been altered to remove favouritism and any dreams of doing things that aren't caring for long-dead pets! But that's changing your personality which is basically the death of self, so - let's say that doesn't happen either.
T-Rex: Hmm.
Utahraptor: Perhaps there's a personal heaven for each person?
T-Rex: YES.
T-Rex: And everyone ELSE in that heaven is an illusion constructed to maximize your pleasure, and therefore there's a separate heaven for each sentient being.
Utahraptor: But then you're just seeing simulations of your friends: an eternity trapped with fake people on a holodeck you can't control.

T-Rex: As I'm attempting to convey, Dromiceiomimus, it was awfully gross! Why can't food get more delicious as it gets older? Why does everything have to turn to a brown mush whenever I forget about it?
Dromiceiomimus: Because of the second law of thermodynamics?
T-Rex: There isn't a first, second, third OR zeroth law of thermodynamics that I haven't broken!
Utahraptor: I find that literally impossible to believe!
T-Rex: My friend: allow me to prove it to you!
Narrator: LATER:

T-Rex: See, Dromiceiomimus, I was going to say ""best goddess ever"", but the fact that there's a goddess Frigg has immeasurably improved MY ENTIRE LIFE. Frigg! She can SEE THE FUTURE but doesn't tell anyone what she sees, so when someone stubs their toe they can say ""Aw, FRIGG!"" and that is DEFINITELY probably where the expression comes from.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't believe that's the case?
T-Rex: There's even a plant known as Frigg's grass. So awesome!

T-Rex: Yeah, but what if the majority decided to be totally racist against you? You're pooched!
Utahraptor: People have worried about this before, my friend!
T-Rex: What do they say?
Utahraptor: Well, what you're worried about is called the ""tyranny of the majority"", and it's usually countered by the observation that there's at least a push for minority rights being respected in a democracy, since we're all minorities in one way or another.

LAW TWO: a sweet party must allow admittance to any sentient being who is totally sweet, except where such admittance would conflict with the First Law. Law three! A sweet party must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the other Laws.

2446,"Zombies have appeared and humanity is failing, until we get some help from a very unexpected source, long thought to be merely the stuff of folk tales: the vampires.  Revealing themselves en masse worldwide, they join our side.  With their help, humanity at last stands a fighting chance for survival.  We don't know why the Vampires are helping us until a second-act reveal shocks us with the origin of Zombie Zero, whose mindless bite first began spreading the degenerate strain.  But just as it seems like humanity might win, we discover even as society was crumbling, elements of the U.S. Army began experiments in weaponizing... The Bite.  Army-branded pseudo-zombies have broken loose: and unlike the ones we were originally fighting, these ones think.  These ones work in squads.  These ones answer only to The General.",,"T-Rex: When you become a vampire you become undead. Even though your body has died and your heart no longer pumps and lungs no longer breathe, you live still. Your brain is fine. Your intelligence is unaffected. You have not suffered a death of self.
T-Rex: Pretty sweet deal, babes!
T-Rex: But what if that delicate process that turns you from mortal to vampire... failed? What if something in this turning went wrong, even briefly? We can suffocate to death in minutes, suffer brain damage in seconds. Suppose, during that transformation from a being who needs an active circulatory and respiratory system to survive to one who doesn't, there was a problem. Suppose your brain - everything that makes you YOU - died.
Utahraptor: Why, you'd be left with an undead body but a dead brain!
T-Rex: SOUND LIKE ANYONE YOU KNOW??
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I put to you that vampires and zombies ARE, IN FACT, THE SAME BEING. Zombies are merely FAILED VAMPIRES, the degenerate case of that transformation process!! The thirst for blood, without an intellect to restrain it and refine it, becomes a mindless hunger for flesh!
Utahraptor: Holy crap.

T-Rex: PHILOSOPHICAL zombies, that is!
Dromiceiomimus: Philosophical zombies? Do you mean like a zombie Plato or Ayn Rand or something?
T-Rex: While that WOULD likely be more fun to talk about, I am instead referring to the idea of a person who acts externally like a real, sentient person, but who actually lacks consciousness. A mental zombie! A philosophical zombie.
Utahraptor: But these ""zombies"" act human?
T-Rex: Sure do! But inside they are DEAD.
Utahraptor: So there's no real way to tell if anyone is a philosophical zombie. This is the same old ""I'm only REALLY sure of my own consciousness"" argument, only sexed up with the living dead!

T-Rex: If I must deal with others, it should be as TRADERS, in a pure capitalist system. No charity! No sympathy! Just business, an exchange of value for value.
Utahraptor: But where does love fit into this system of Objectivism, T-Rex?
T-Rex: What do you mean?
Utahraptor: Well if everything is viewed as a business arrangement between traders without charity, then how can you have love? Love is selfless.
T-Rex: Nope! Love is selfISH. You see value in someone, and they see value in you! You want access to this value, so you arrange a spiritual exchange.

Utahraptor: Wow! I personally don't see how any relationship can fail with these sure-fire tips.
T-Rex: I agree! I would say that if the relationship is failing despite these tips, then you and your man may have insurmountable, fundamental differences, even if you love each other more than you can say. Nothing's meant to last forever, ladies!

But one day a big crime is committed and the only guy who knows anything about it is this criminal: a criminal who is prone to cracking wise! So the cop and the criminal have to team up to stop the bad guys before they commit crimes again. And at the end they have learned to respect each other's way of life, and they hug for a while. Five stars!

In Round One everyone gets to decide how many of their cards they want to drop, but it turns out no matter what number you say, you get the same amount of cards back to replace them. Ha ha! This game was designed by a madman. You go around in circles with each trying and failing to discard; it is pointless and futile.

T-Rex: In this round, you realize that your cards are actually... POKÉMON.
Utahraptor: It's a total Pokémon rip off!
T-Rex: I know, right?! The only difference is your cards attack all at once and don't even evolve, so it's like a dumb baby version. And, AS ALWAYS, a full Electric team EASILY beats a mix of Water and Flying-type Pokérmon!
Utahraptor: Only they call those ""straight flush"" and ""full house"" instead. Even the names are dumber!!
T-Rex: The winner is the person who KOs all the other cards, and as a prize, the losers have to pay the winner actual real-life money. The losers get LITERALLY POORER because their random cards didn't fight the best in imagination land!

T-Rex: Ho ho! Did you catch the comedy there? There are two meanings in that phrase! If you didn't get it, don't worry - the key to emulating understanding is often just to repeat the last word or phrase. Fake a laugh, say ""Hah! TIRED."" and you will be SET.

After my would-be heirs spend the night in the haunted house, which is clearly specified in my will to be ACTUALLY HAUNTED, they have to successfully navigate a series of dares and challenges - punching bears, eating chairs, that sort of thing - all designed to bring them together and underline a valuable life lesson: ""MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING"". Then, they get the money.
Utahraptor: They'll just contest the will, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What's that?
Utahraptor: They'll contest it, or everyone will agree to redact the bear-slappy clauses. Happens all the time.
T-Rex: The hell? This is my LAST CHANCE to make people do things for money, and you're saying they're not legally bound to do it?!

T-Rex: For example, the Portuguese have the word ""saudade"", which means basically ""deep nostalgic longing for something that's left and is loved and which, though we may repress that knowledge, may never return"". You can even get the saudades for someone in the present while anticipating the future, or for something that doesn't even exist!
Utahraptor: It's kind of a frothy mixture of nostalgia and regret, right?
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: So you can see why it appeals to me. We should lexicalize that sentiment into a single English word, so that we too might talk about it easily and - dare I dream - more often?
Utahraptor: Okay! What'll the word be?
T-Rex: Let's go with... NOSTALGRETZ.

T-Rex: So here's the pitch: LASSIE - the dog everyone remembers, great at solving problems AND warning folks that Timmy fell down the well! Only this time around, Timmy didn't fall down the well: he was PUSHED.
Dromiceiomimus: *gasp*
T-Rex: And the party responsible? An evil dog who, instead of always saving people, is CONSTANTLY putting them into peril: CORPORAL SNUGGS.
Utahraptor: A Joker to Lassie's Batman!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: He focuses Lassie, giving her drive in her endless war against chaos. Plus, he's a Pomeranian who wears a cape. OH MY GOD. It's SO ADORABLE when Snuggs puts his paw on the launch button. Can Lassie stop the nukes in time? Yeah probably but we should all watch to make sure!
Utahraptor: I - I would actually watch this.

T-Rex: ... For a first try!
T-Rex: The problem is that we're spending longer and longer studying. If you do a PhD, you could be 30 years old when you graduate! And since there's so much to know about the world, people are forced to specialize. Even at 30, there just isn't enough time to learn it all!
Utahraptor: It's a necessary tradeoff! Millions of people specialize and make tiny contributions to knowledge.
T-Rex: It's true!
T-Rex: But what if it didn't have to be that way? If we lived forever, we could learn so much! We could make connections between completely unrelated fields.
Utahraptor: This is true, but the older generation would always remain! If they became stuck in their ways, they might inhibit progress instead of helping.

T-Rex: Seriously! I had some DOUBTS.
T-Rex: If I was writing a western I could go on and on about order versus freedom, civilization versus the wilderness, the hero as a man stuck between these two worlds, and so on! But what's science fiction about? Is it just literature with space ships and robots and casually inverted flux variance? Aliens stopped being parallels for The Other long ago, didn't they?
Utahraptor: Why are you worried about this, T-Rex? It's just a genre label!
T-Rex: So?
Utahraptor: So - it's something that's applied to your work after it's completed. Unless you want to write specifically to a generic form, you don't have to worry about it!

Dromiceiomimus: I don't get why you keep insisting Tuggy isn't anthropomorphized, but you give him volition. Is he a robot tugboat or something?
T-Rex: He's just a regular tugboat, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: So what's he doing in space?
T-Rex: Character development!
Utahraptor: No, I mean, how does a tugboat end up in orbit? Your readers will want to know this! How does he move? Are his compartments pressurized?

T-Rex: Oh! Just idly speculating that if you define immortality as ""living for as long as it's possible to live"", then if I were somehow responsible for the complete destruction of the universe, I'd EFFECTIVELY be immortal. I'd have lived for as long as it was possible to, until the UNIVERSE ITSELF was lost!

T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: I could say ""That is a rad word"", referring to, perhaps, the word 'syzygy'. But then I could ALSO say ""That 'that' is a rad word!"", referring to the 'that' in my previous sentence! Then I could go on to say that ""That 'That ""that""' is a rad phrase"", and so on, to INFINITY.

T-Rex: Because poops are provably so gross!!
T-Rex: At first I thought maybe they're gross because they're waste, but not all waste is gross. Rabbit poops are cute little pellets that don't really smell. But cow poops are giant puddles of sorrow! Sometimes they're crusty with sun-heated puddles of sorrow inside.
Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex! Gross!!
T-Rex: I know! Scientists need to look into this!!
Utahraptor: Maybe we think they're gross because they're bad to eat?

T-Rex: I know, it sucks!

Dromiceiomimus: You're talking career-wise?

Utahraptor: We can't know what might've been, T-Rex. It's impossible!

1078,mr. tusks!! that's not how evolution works!,,"Narrator: ISLAND DWARFISM COMICS
T-Rex: Island dwarfism is BASICALLY the best form of evolution ever.
T-Rex: It's SO CUTE!
T-Rex: Basically, the idea is that if a species gets to an island and is then isolated, it can evolve on its own, apart from what's happening on the rest of the planet. And if food supplies are limited, as they often are on islands, smaller individuals have an evolutionary advantage since they need less food to live! If the larger species survives at all, it usually survives by shrinking.
Utahraptor: How much shrinkage are we talking about here?
T-Rex: Oh my goodness, Utahraptor, you have no idea!
T-Rex: You can get dwarf ELEPHANTS. Tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but how tin-
T-Rex: Is a 98% reduction in mass tiny enough for you? Utahraptor. THEY ARE THE MAYORS OF TINY TOWNE.

Utahraptor: But what if you ended up being sad?

T-Rex: You are diluting our message here, UTAHRAPTOR.

T-Rex: Medusa was now the greatest biological weapon on the face of the planet.

He thought both were unnatural: interest makes something (money) from nothing (no action on the lender's part), while homosexuals make nothing (hot gay action doesn't count!) from something (their reproductive organs).

Ladies and gentlemen: this is totally awesome.
T-Rex: Now we all have cows!
T-Rex: But let's also say we all share a field for them to graze in. The problem is that any field can only support so many cows -- any more and those ladies will gobble the grass faster than it can regrow!
Dromiceiomimus: So it's in our shared interest to not overcow the field.
T-Rex: NO OVERCOWING. Yes!
Utahraptor: But if I add just ONE extra cow, it's not going to be the end of the world.
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: But the tragedy is we might ALL rationally conclude ""one more cow won't hurt"", which destroys the field! Worse, we can foresee this situation, and realize our only option left is to get all our cows in the field as quickly as possible, BEFORE it's gone.
Utahraptor: That's pretty terrible!
T-Rex: To conclude: this is why I got the heck out of authority-free shared land cow ownership!

Dromiceiomimus: Wait a minute... Pen Guinn? THE Rita Lerr?
T-Rex: MAY I REMIND YOU MY CHARACTERS ARE LEGALLY AND CREATIVELY DISTINCT??
Utahraptor: T-Rex, did you even try making up your own characters?
T-Rex: I did! Quite successfully, obvs!
Utahraptor: No, what you've done is convert Batman names into semi-plausible given names. Why not write a story where Batman goes undercover as ""Abe Atman""? At least that would be more honest.
T-Rex: And the Riddler goes undercover as ""Rita Lerr""! AND THEN THEY GO ON A DATE BY ACCIDENT! YES. THIS IS AMAZING.

T-Rex: ... for some reason!
T-Rex: Haha! See what I did there, Dromiceiomimus? I implied that socialism is flawed because people don't really have a motivation to share with each other.
Dromiceiomimus: It's a tragic flaw of our characters that we don't share as often, or as equally, as we should.
T-Rex: Yeah, that - that was my joke.
Utahraptor: Making fun of our fundamental flaws, are we? Classy!
T-Rex: Hey!
T-Rex: Holy, why is everyone so touchy about the tragic and fundamental flaws of their nature today? I'm sorry we all don't share enough, but I'm not going to IGNORE it and hope it goes away. I deal with the issues!
Utahraptor: Not hardly! You can't deal with the ""issue"" of socialism by just summing it up in a few sentences!

Dromiceiomimus: ""Check it""?
T-Rex: That's what some people are like, Dromiceiomimus!!
Utahraptor: But lots of the alternative names can be considered obscene, can't they?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: But they can also be entirely free from any quasi-insulting Latinate etymology the other words have. There's people trying to reclaim these currently-taboo words in the same way ""queer"" was!
Utahraptor: Neat! But largely irrelevant to us, as our reproduction is not done through vaginal intercourse!

Celsius puts zero at the point where water freezes, and 100 at the point where it boils. That's handy! Water's EVERYWHERE, man.

Utahraptor: I think all this underscores how arbitrary these systems of measurement are!

Utahraptor: How is it racist? Is the apple-hater of a minority creed or socio-economic group?
T-Rex: Oh my god! SO RACIST.

T-Rex: There are plenty of websites, magazine articles and body spray ads that will reassure you that women are just conquests without agency and that they won't have sex with you unless you suggest it to them first. My advice is DIFFERENT. My advice is rooted in reality and allows for women actually wanting the intercourse sometimes!
Utahraptor: Okay, so let's hear it!
T-Rex: The advice?
Utahraptor: Yeah. Let's hear this modern, sexually enlightened advice that applies to both lesbians AND dudes.
T-Rex: WELL, for that you'll have to buy my book, ""Dudes! Lesbians! Guess What? Here is How to Get Women to Like You"". But since we're friends, I'll give you a sneak peek!

848,"t-rex isn't trying to be rude, it's just - it's so upsetting that the uncanny valley got personified.",,"T-Rex: The Uncanny Valley is the name given to the idea that as we build robots that look more and more like real people, the more we approach a point where we all say ""oh God oh God what is wrong with that robot where did it all go wrong OH GOD"".
T-Rex: This also applies to animation!
T-Rex: The idea is that crudely-realized characters don't look like real people, but we can see some qualities of real people in them, so they're cute! But as you add more and more realism without quite reaching perfection, you reach a point where suddenly instead of cartoons that look real, they're real people who look TERRIBLY WRONG. Cuteness is replaced with the same reaction we'd have to a putrid, retching, animated corpse: revulsion, and the question ""Why??"".
Utahraptor: But if you can make the characters look even better, you get past that!
T-Rex: True!
T-Rex: Hence the ""valley"" - you accept the creature more and more, then are suddenly repulsed, then you accept it the most.
Utahraptor: Perhaps... a powerful metaphor for LOVE?
T-Rex: Hah! I don't think I love the way you do!

T-Rex: Maybe I'd suggest our honeybabe in question blundered. Did she just slip up, or did she totally botch it? Maybe it was just an error? A miscalculation? An oversight? A FAILURE? The words we choose indicate how severe a mistake it was, but ALSO suggest various degrees of culpability, and most of us are pretty finely tuned to their nuances of meaning - even honeybabes!
Utahraptor: This just in, English has a lot of words for a bunch of stuff! Film at 11?
T-Rex: It's got real applications!
T-Rex: We're getting closer to computers that can choose their own words, and this shows how sensitive these choices can be!
Utahraptor: If you misspell a word, ""You made a boo-boo"" is fine, but if you press the wrong button and lazer 5000 dudes, that's probably not the mot juste?

Utahraptor: Your question is really two questions combined into one!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: It breaks down to ""Have you ever punched children, and, if so, are you still doing so?"" But since these are merged, and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer, ""no"" becomes misleading. The solution is not to answer ""yes"" or ""no"", but to reject the question!

T-Rex: It was an exciting time to be saying ""Forsooth""!
T-Rex: And some of these dudes were big into English being developed as a ""real"" language, particularly one John Wycliffe, who decided to translate the Bible - one of, if not THE most important book of his time - into casual English.

T-Rex: Aww! I'm sorry, imaginary dude!
Dromiceiomimus: That is pretty sad, T-Rex! If you want some advice, my secret to making things sad has always been in filling out the background details. If the parents gave the kid the marbles BEFORE he got sick, and if this simple luxury was the last they could afford before the medical bills started coming in, that makes it more sad, I think!
T-Rex: It's true! Huh! Thanks for the advice, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: And you could make it even sadder by turning the boy into a puppy!
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: A puppy! My secret to sadness has always been to take something sad, and then imagine it's happening to a poor little puppy dog with a broken leg.
T-Rex: It TOTALLY works! I just thought that losing a job would be sad, but a poor little injured puppy losing its job? That's heartbreaking!

T-Rex: I didn't mean to say ""adorable""; I meant to say ""insanely creepy, washing their food while maintaining unbroken eye contact with you, licking their lips slowly over and over again, thinking only one phrase: 'I EAT DEATH'"".
T-Rex: Anyway.
T-Rex: Then we thought they did it because they didn't have enough saliva and therefore liked their food pre-moistened!
T-Rex: But now we think it's because they have sensitive hands!
Utahraptor: Sensitive hands?
T-Rex: Yeah. Raccoons have these sensitive hands, and they're checking out what they're about to eat, and water helps makes them more sensitive.
Utahraptor: Neat!
T-Rex: But the POINT is that if you give a raccoon a sugar cube, it'll wash it, and then the sugar will dissolve! HILARIOUS!

Dromiceiomimus: The hospital is a medical doctor?
T-Rex: They're that sexy.
Utahraptor: But men can still buy regular costumes!

T-Rex: For instance: these smart machines could make even smarter machines!
T-Rex: And so on until we have super duper smart machines that will look on us as mere playthings. Will they destroy us? Or will we merge ourselves with technology, and in doing so become a new, more cybernetic lifeform? Our choices seem limited to either becoming something new, or facing irrelevance and obsolescence!

Utahraptor: Oh man, is she serious?
T-Rex: Is she being totally serious to our faces right now??

T-Rex: Then again, our actions, as a people, HAVE been responsible for untold thousands of involuntary extinctions around the world - which could all be avoided in the future by voluntarily offering ourselves up instead! The final generation gets to spend everyone's life savings and throw a totally wicked party, and the last one out turns off the lights. The end!
Utahraptor: You sound like you're actually convincing yourself that this is a good idea!

T-Rex: Yeah, maybe. I think I still need some more convincing.

T-Rex: Yep! I know we're being sensationalistic here, since there's only been thirteen people on the moon EVER, and that's a pretty small sample size. But still! No women! No grandmothers! NO SULLEN TEENS (FEMALE). Just men!
T-Rex: Also: no asians?
T-Rex: Is there a reason why all the Apollo missions were crewed by dudes?

T-Rex: So, there's that too!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus here will be responsible for the basic rules of the road: when to go, when to stop, when to rush into an intersection because your light's friggin' GREEN even though traffic's moving so slowly that there's no possible way you'll be out of the intersection before you block traffic.
Dromiceiomimus: You should never do that, class.
T-Rex: See? WRITE THAT DOWN.
T-Rex: Utahraptor will be responsible for teaching you what to do in a merge lane!
Utahraptor: Indeed I will!
Utahraptor: And the lesson is simple: DON'T just speed down the lane so you can butt in at the front of the line.
T-Rex: If you do pull off that dick move, I am sorry, but I will end you. People will find your body and say ""Dear lord! Was he a dick at merging? Probably, huh?""

T-Rex: It's a song
T-Rex: Anyway, ""goodness"" is an unstable, inconsistent and unreliable measure.
Utahraptor: So?
T-Rex: So, why are we SO CONCERNED if something is good or not? It's relative! It's an OPINION. We should judge things by something we can objectively measure: POPULARITY.

T-Rex: (It was seriously awesome!)
T-Rex: And time was it was a necessary feature in every great movie - just like car chases are today! You could go into a theatre and be GUARANTEED the slap across the face / smooch on the lips combo, SOMETIMES even before the opening credits were over. It was good times! I like the car chases, of course, but I miss the nuance of the old topos. Great actors would bring such subtlety to the face slap - such pathos to the ensuing makeouts!
Utahraptor: I missed the ""car chases are necessary in every great movie today"" memo!
T-Rex: Necessary AND sufficient!
T-Rex: And like I said, they're fantastic, but they don't lend themselves to the smooches. Today's actors COULD yell at each other and then make out during a car chase, but they never do.

Utahraptor: Listen T-Rex, are you really sure you want an Enemies List?

352,"'consider the following' comes courtesy of bill nye, the science guy!",,"T-Rex: I submit that there are a finite number of songs! Therefore, the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility.
T-Rex: Consider the following!
T-Rex: There are effective limits on what constitutes music. If we take a week as a very generous upper-bound on the length of one song, then we have a temporal limit. Furthermore, since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones, we do not have a continuum of notes, but rather, a finite set. Therefore, there are only so many songs that can be written!
Utahraptor: I am forced to disagree with you, my friend!
T-Rex: Surely not!
Utahraptor: I think that you're omitting many dimensions of song. What about the way it's played, the lyrics? These too can be varied almost indefinitely.

The song is simple, catchy, memorable, AND has a steady beat that runs, as it turns out, at exactly 100 beats a minute.
Utahraptor: So the professional performing CPR on me is thinking ""Bum bum bum / Another one bites the dust""?
T-Rex: Quite possibly!
T-Rex: And if I ever need to perform CPR on you, you can bet I'LL be belting it out at the top of my lungs.
Utahraptor: T-Thanks?
T-Rex: No worries, man! I've got your back. Listen. It'll be a great show.

635,"i like how t-rex assumes god would see merit to both sides of the issue.  it's fair, i guess!",,"T-Rex: Intelligent design (or ID) is the idea that while we may begin to understand the Universe through science, it is actually created with divine intent. Evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations, but rather, intentional.
T-Rex: Much as a watch implies a watchmaker, so does our Universe imply divinity!
T-Rex: Okay! It's a very nice idea, but it's not science because it's not disprovable: you either believe in intelligent design or you don't, and there's no way to show who's right. That's not science - that's faith!
Dromiceiomimus: And should faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method?
T-Rex: Of course not!
Utahraptor: The issue is that some think ID should be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution, right?
T-Rex: Right!
T-Rex: But there's nothing in ID (as I've formulated it) to say that the two can't exist peacefully. One just doesn't belong in science class, because it's not a science. It belongs in religion class.

2018,"EVERY HUMAN ON THE PLANET levitates off into the sky, except those living in certain places where there's almost no magnetic force, and others may just find they can jump higher but don't float away.  And it may be more of a ""sideways"" force than an ""upwards force"" at the equator but STILL.  Not bad?",,"T-Rex: Because the planet spins, the earth's liquid core acts as a dynamo, generating a magnetic field! And magnetism can do some cool stuff, but at our current rotational speed we only get about 60 microteslas of force, which ISN'T MUCH.
T-Rex: A stupid fridge magnet alone is 80 times stronger, and those are BORING!
T-Rex: But check it: multiply the Earth's magnetic field by a quarter of a million times, and you've got magnetic force to mess with the electrons in a frog's atoms enough that it LEVITATES. The average frog weighs 1/4000th of a human, so therefore with a billion times the earth's magnetic field, EVERY HUMAN
T-Rex: ON THE PLANET
T-Rex: WOULD LEVITATE OFF INTO THE SKY.
T-Rex: So let's assume the planet's magnetic field increases linearly with rotation!
Utahraptor: Sure, why not?
Utahraptor: Then to get your desired magnetic field you just need the planet to spin a billion times faster - at which point each day would last, oh I don't know, about 40 MILLIONTHS of a second.

Utahraptor: Well, I imagine proteins are digested and used in different ways!
T-Rex: Unsatisfactory!!
T-Rex: I want to know precisely where my meals will end up before I eat them! You know what my dream is? My dream is to pick out a lobster in a tank and say ""Oh, I'll have that one, the one on the right. Yes. Have him boiled; I will consume his flesh. I will turn him into eyeballs.""

Dromiceiomimus: So it's the same old ""steal technology from the future"" idea?
T-Rex: A little! But a lot of alternate universes would probably be at about the same tech level. What I'm really interested in is culture!
Utahraptor: You're hoping that in alternate universes, you'll get alternate versions of Hamlet!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: That's a great example. Shakespeare wrote some fantastic plays, but there's only so many of them. But infinite parallel Shakespeares on infinite parallel typewriters pretty much have to give us some terrific pieces of literature!

T-Rex: And suppose causality still holds, so that events in the past determine the future!
T-Rex: So when I send a message to Past T-Rex, he'll act on it - and that'll change the universe that I, Present T-Rex, live in! So presumably now I'd send a different message back in time, which will again change how past T-Rex acts. We've got an unstable loop of constantly changing timelines, but it SHOULD proceed towards an equilibrium!
Utahraptor: And the simplest equilibrium is that no message is sent at all?
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: I send a message that makes Past Me decide not to send a message back in time. When he reaches the present, no message is sent, and the universe reverts to how it was originally! Time travel might ERASE ITSELF every time it happens!

T-Rex: DIONYSIAN imitatio!
T-Rex: The idea here is that there's a dude named Dionysius who decided that everything worthwhile saying has already been said, but maybe, just MAYBE, it hasn't been said well enough? So you stand on the shoulders of giants and read what they wrote and say ""Calm down everybody, I got this"" and then you rewrite it!

T-Rex: If you're unfamiliar with them, Dromiceiomimus, number stations are radio stations that play pre-recorded voices reciting long strings of numbers, often with a short musical cue beginning or ending the segments. They are encoded communication often meant for spies, encrypted using one-time pads!

One day on the playground I walked up to him and moved my mouth like I was talking but I didn't say anything. I just wanted to - I don't know, see if he'd be tricked or something. He wasn't, of course, and wasn't even that upset, but all of a sudden I could see what a jerk I was being. I don't want to be the kind of person who does that.
T-Rex: Wow! Um - wow.
Utahraptor: Yeah!

T-Rex: I've said it before, but I'll say it again: the absurdists were not the cheeriest potatoes in the bag.
Utahraptor: But if we don't want to kill ourselves, we can find religion, right?
T-Rex: Right!
T-Rex: Religion can give hope of a kind and caring world beyond our absurd one. But since they see reason as the greatest tool we've got and religion relies on faith, it's rejected by the absurdists as a (just as deadly!) PHILOSOPHICAL suicide.
Utahraptor: So what's left?

T-Rex: Attention men! Are you a man? Here are some tips!
T-Rex: Tip 1: Grooming is important!
T-Rex: This means that you have to shower and if you always wake up with food on your face then you have to understand that you have a problem. We all have problems, but yours is that you go to sleep beside bowls of wet salad and then in your sleep, you tip over the bowl. You need to work on that. I don't know what to tell you.
T-Rex: Tip 2: prostate exams: apparently important?
Utahraptor: Apparently prostate exams are pretty important!
T-Rex: Tip 3: In some situations, like truck stops, manliness is measured by virility, so you may wish to boast of sexual conquests. But in other situations (job interviews), it’s measured by problem solving skills and your ability to work in groups!
Utahraptor: True men can easily distinguish between such situations.
Narrator: TIPS FOR WOMEN

T-Rex: This DOES explain why no Spider-men Hulks have tried to steal my girlfriend!!
T-Rex: But it makes things pretty depressing. Watch an action movie and you can think ""That could be me, if my chums and I were ever sent into space to blow up an asteroid."" But there's no way I can become Spider-man OR Hulk! Or Flash. Or Green Lantern or even Black Canary.
T-Rex: *sigh*
Utahraptor: You could still become Green Lantern, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really?!
Utahraptor: Sure! He's given his powers through an alien ring, so really you just need a slightly modified Drake Equation that incorporates the odds of strangers giving you stuff.
T-Rex: And by making myself more charismatic, I increase that chance, which thereby increases my Green Lantern Ring Potential!!

T-Rex: [thinks] I should make a comic where famed scientist Francis Bacon teams up with a guy named ""Eggs"", so they can be called Bacon and Eggs. In issue two, Francis could mistakenly rename himself to ""Chris P.""! Chris P. Bacon!

1749,"""later on your sense of smell was restored through a series of misadventures, and you insisted on celebrating by smelling everyone""",,"Narrator: WE JOIN OUR STORY AFTER T-REX HAS LOST HIS SENSE OF SMELL:
T-Rex: It happened yesterday, shortly after I was complaining about advertising slogans!
T-Rex: And it was DEFINITELY the most interesting part of my day!
T-Rex: Do you remember it, Dromiceiomimus? How amazing it was? How it was awesome, in both the colloquial AND old-skool biblical sense?
Dromiceiomimus: I do! And as I recall, it went a little something like this...
Narrator: ""YOU WERE TALKING TO UTAHRAPTOR""
T-Rex: Utahraptor! We meet again, sooner than usual!
Utahraptor: Yep!
Narrator: ""YOU ASKED HIM IF HE'D ANYTHING TO ADD ABOUT AD SLOGANS""
T-Rex: Do you have anything to add... about AD SLOGANS??
Utahraptor: No. No, I think we covered it pretty well earlier.

T-Rex: I'm going nuts!
T-Rex: LIQUID NUTS!
T-Rex: See what I did there, Dromiceiomimus? I used ""liquid"" as an intensifier.
Dromiceiomimus: Like ""super""?
T-Rex: Yep! It goes nuts, super nuts, nutty crackers, and then liquid nuts for only the nuttiest things.
Dromiceiomimus: Can this also be applied to chocolate bars?
T-Rex: YOU KNOW IT CAN'T. That would be heresy!
Utahraptor: Liquid heresy!
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: I do think ""nuts"" can be applied to chocolate bars though.
T-Rex: Okay honestly it can apply to chocolate bars, but it becomes confusing if the bar isn't crammed with nuts, or somehow liquidly nutty. There is a SEMANTIC COLLISION.
Narrator: SUDDENLY!
T-Rex: Anyway, I meant what I said about going nuts. I feel like I've got this powerful instinct for self-destruction, and I'm just fooling myself if I think I can control it.
Off panel: You're so crazy, T-Rex!
T-Rex (punchline): I'm wacky times!
"
618,"'it's very embarrassing and sometimes i require medical attention' is one of those phrases i would have liked to get through life without saying, if possible",,"T-Rex: One of the great myths of our time is that the trick to becoming good at something is to practice it over and over.
T-Rex: I'm afraid I must respectfully disagree!!
T-Rex: PROOF BY COUNTEREXAMPLE: I have probably been practicing eating hundreds of thousands of times! And yet, sometimes I screw it up. Practice clearly hasn't helped me here, because I should be super awesome at eating by now!
Dromiceiomimus: You screw it up?
T-Rex: I choke! It goes down the wrong tube or whatever. It's very embarrassing and sometimes I require medical attention.
Utahraptor: Well, to be fair, there's a difference between practicing eating and just doing it many times over many years, T-Rex!
Utahraptor: When you're practicing, you're more aware of what you're doing, examining your own actions with an eye for improvement. It's a focus one doesn't have while simply eating as a matter of routine!
T-Rex: Perhaps it's a focus YOU don't have, dude! You forget that I am extremely intense.
T-Rex: And I can prove it, too! Ask me how my day was.
Off panel: Okay, how was your day?
T-Rex (punchline): FRIGGIN' INTENSE!

762,"although, upon closer inspection, 'What Do You Do When You Want To Give A Loved One A Present That Is Alive' would also make a pretty sweet title.  can you imagine?",,"Narrator: T-REX IN: ""FLOWERS IN RELATIONSHIPS""
T-Rex: I am against giving your sweetie flowers when you are in a relationship. Oh God! Think of the symbolism!
T-Rex: The horrible symbolism!
Dromiceiomimus: What symbolism? They just show that you care!
T-Rex: No way! They represent AFFECTION, right? They represent your love. But they die in like a week, no matter what you do! I don't need no punkass flowers reminding me that everything beautiful dies sooner than I want to believe.
Utahraptor: So what do you do when you want to give a loved one a present that is alive?
T-Rex: I buy POTTED PLANTS.
T-Rex: They're still in the ground, so they last for years! Tada!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but they'll still die eventually! All that's changed is that NOW your sweetie has to care for the plants until then, as they represent your relationship in much the same way the flowers did!
T-Rex: True! However, the plants now ALSO serve as a constant reminder of me and how I need water (viz., smooches)!
T-Rex (punchline): I am writing a book called ""Relentless Reminders of Physical Neediness: Maybe She'll Like You Now?""

T-Rex: So Burger King, you can stay the hell home!! The athletes competing here, these Adonises and Adonisettes, they don't need your fatty foods and empty calories! They have BIG MACS® and QUARTER POUNDERS WITH CHEESE® lovingly crafted by McDonald's, who've turned the full force of their multinational corporation towards ensuring no athlete, no matter WHERE they live on the planet, will ever be inconveniently far away from a handful of fries served in a paper sleeve!
Utahraptor: But suppose our greatest champions get thirsty?
T-Rex: Please!
T-Rex: Perhaps you've forgotten Coca-Cola, THE OFFICIAL SUGARED AND COLOURED BEVERAGE OF MCDONALD'S PRESENTS THE OLYMPIC GAMES?? You want a sculpted gold-medal body? Have you tried exercising? Sure, maybe. But have you tried CHUGGING A COKE?
Utahraptor: I - I haven't! I need to get on that already!!
T-Rex: You should really check out McDonald's Presents The Olympic Games, everyone! Between sets, Cap'n Crunch and Count Chokula are moderating a panel on early-onset diabetes!!

T-Rex: WHAT IF I DON'T CARE
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Any luck finding Nintendo?
T-Rex: None!
T-Rex: I found Coca-Cola, but all he wanted to do was watch me drink Coke.
Utahraptor: I mean, that makes sense.
T-Rex: Then he wanted to go find athletes so he could pay them to say they drink Coke too.
Utahraptor: Again: makes sense.
T-Rex: Then his eyes rolled back in his head and Coke shot out from his face in a spectacular geyser! And lo, the entire food court was drenched in warm sticky Coca-Cola, and we drank. We drank until we were sated.
T-Rex (punchline): I'm - I'm not sure another multinational could love me anymore

God: POSSIBLY

T-Rex: God said that Shakespeare hated my sweet rhymes, and to prove it he pretended to be Shakespeare!
Utahraptor: Well if he can do anything, that'd necessarily include ""Shakespeare impersonations"".

T-Rex: And the pace of innovation is only accelerating. Consider that iPods from only five years ago are now LUDICROUSLY UNACCEPTABLE, when in history a person might own a single record player their entire lives! It is certain that in the year 65,000,000 marvels dwarfing even branded consumer electronics await us. What new and fundamental discoveries about the universe are ahead? Will our personal holographic media players ALSO accept phone calls??
Utahraptor: I believe they may not!

Dromiceiomimus: We both know I'm always down for swimming, T-Rex, but isn't that a bit - mercenary?
T-Rex: No man! We're not going to be terrible people who are friends with a guy just because he has a pool. We'll be awesome sexy WELL-ADJUSTED people who are friends with a guy because he's totes sweet, and the pool will be a bonus! It's ""gravy"" on ""the side"".
Utahraptor: So you don't think it's at all mercenary to seek out friends with splashy benefits.
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: If I'M being mercenary by wanting a friend with a pool, then sexy young people who have the express goal of seducing a rich older partner who will soon die and leave all the money to them are mercenary too.

"
191,i submit to you that nobody would want to live in a world with such a language!,,"T-Rex: I have been thinking about what the Utahraptor said yesterday, and by extension the ambiguity allowable in language!
T-Rex: Take the Bible, for instance!
T-Rex: There's a text passed down for hundreds of generations, translated, re-written, re-edited.
T-Rex: Even if you don’t assume that it’s the Word of God, the difference in meaning between what was written THEN and what you read NOW must be staggering!
T-Rex: It's often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas!
Utahraptor: I agree!
T-Rex: But the Bible shows us that language is mutable! So what's the solution? How can I ensure that the ideas I have in my head when I communicate are the same as those you get in yours when you hear me?
Utahraptor: I propose a rigorously defined language without syntactic or lexical ambiguity!
T-Rex: But how would we write puns in such a language?
T-Rex: Eh?
T-Rex (punchline): Or delightfully sexy double entendres?
"
543,relationships are also for the young and the criminally inane,,"T-Rex: Anyway! Relationships are for the young and the criminally insane. What's of real importance is that I saw a car dealership ad yesterday advertising that ""no reasonable offer will be refused""!
T-Rex: Well, yeah!
T-Rex: Oooh, ads like that burn my biscuits. Of course they're not going to refuse a reasonable offer! That's what makes it so reasonable! And worse, since ""reasonable"" can be a very subjective word, it's not really saying anything beyond ""Hey, I won't refuse an offer for reasons that I personally find irrational.""
Utahraptor: It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's thought fueled by rage!!
T-Rex: It just bothers me that they're trying to make it sound like a big thing when it's just business as usual! That's deceptive.
Utahraptor: That's advertising!
T-Rex: So annoying! Plus, I saw this other ad on the same day that said ""everyone approved O.A.C.""
T-Rex: O.A.C. stands for ""on approved credit""! Everyone's approved if they're approved?! Aaargh!
T-Rex (punchline): I could make some joke about tautological advertisements, but I find them too annoying to laugh at right now.

T-Rex: So there!
Utahraptor: How can you act like this?!
T-Rex: What are you talking about?

T-Rex: Most assuredly!
T-Rex: The wind is awesome. So awesome! You can stand on the edge of a cliff, leaves swirling around you, staring out into the wind - into DESTINY - and it's just great. Everything feels dramatic and apocalyptic and awesome. It's WAY better than trying to stare out into destiny during a snow storm, believe you me!
Utahraptor: So your favourite weather is: wind.
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: That's it? No great insight, no perspective beyond ""I like it when it's windy""?

T-Rex: Gluten, or G.L.U.T.E.N., stands for ""Governmental Limitation of Understanding and Thinking: Experimental Nanocompound"". When ingested in sufficient quantities, it changes the way your mind works, making you more pliable to messages of control and submission!
Dromiceiomimus: But some bakeries offer gluten-free bread.
T-Rex: THEY'RE THE UNDERGROUND. Notice how they never last for long??
Utahraptor: Okay, how do you fit people with Celiac disease into your theory?

T-Rex: Plus, if people saw me on the street they could say ""Hey, it's all Well and Good!"", except that they wouldn't actually say the ""all"", so it would just be ""Hey, it's Well and Good"", which doesn't really work.

Dromiceiomimus: okay
Utahraptor: Why can't you just be happy with the name you've got?
T-Rex: I am!

Anyway it's narrated in the third person and at the end of the book Crime goes out on a few dates with the narrator and then he abruptly stops writing because he's all cheezed at her. The end!

T-Rex: True, but if I die at, say, 50, that's 50 years of accumulated experience, knowledge and responsibility that die with me! But if I die at 16 then all the world loses is one wacky teen and one handful of pages of wacky teen fan fiction.
Utahraptor: But at 16 you had way more potential than you would at 50!
T-Rex: Ouch!
Utahraptor: At 16 you've got the potential for both you at 50 AND the potential for trillions of alternate future and alternate yous, possibilities which are trimmed each instant you're alive. At 50 you've already exhausted tons of your options!

T-Rex: First, pick your favourite adjective. May I suggest ""Trending"", ""Collectable"", or ""Brownish""? Then pick your second-favourite adjective, like ""Community"", ""Actionable"", or ""Macabre"". Don't worry, we're almost done! Finally, pick a noun or verb and it helps if it's related to what you do. For example ""Tweeting"", ""Services"", or if you have a terrible imagination, ""Corporation"".
Utahraptor: Okay so... now what?
T-Rex: Slap a period after each word and you're done, babies!
T-Rex: You're now totally down with trendy corporate slogans! Or should I say, ""Trendy. Corporate. Slogans.""?

Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator: CHEKHOV'S GUN
T-Rex: It comes from this playwright Chekhov, who said that if you have a gun on the stage in the first act of a play, it had better be fired by the third! It's been used to sustain interest since forever: James Bond often gets a bunch of gadgets at the beginning of his movie which he'll use later on, and even Perseus got gadgets from the GODS to kill Medusa with! It's the same idea, only Bond's better because he has more explosions. Looks like you lose, Perseus!!
Utahraptor: So if you have Bond getting gadgets that he doesn't use, that's not Chekhov's Gun?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: That's just FRUSTRATED EXPECTATIONS. Honestly, why give James Bond a gun that shoots piranhas if he's never going to fire it? People truly want to see that in action. Also: guns that shoot chainsaws.
Utahraptor: I'd like to see your Bond movie.
T-Rex: I WOULD TOO, darn it.

Text: It is true that as a dinosaur, the T-Rex should have been inclined toward gnashing his ferocious jaws and making claws of his little hands, but he had been stomping things for so long that no one remembered a time when he had gnashed instead of stomped.
Text: Inside, he wanted to gnash, but he doubted himself. He knew that he could stomp. He was not sure he could gnash.
Narrator: ""DINOSAUR COMICS"" by Robert Service.
Text: Well it was long ago, on some grim plateau, When this story first was told, About a land in fear made more severe By a terrible threat of old.
Text: And though the men were brave, the risks were grave In these misty days of yore; None could ever be safe, in this ancient place, From the threat of Dinosaur.
Text: Now the dinosaurs had their fearsome roars, But they had their friendships, too; And while they stalked they often talked, And debated what was true.

Dromiceiomimus: Assuming she's a mammal!
T-Rex: Yes! Also: NEVER ASSUME A WOMAN IS A MAMMAL.
Utahraptor: Another good tip is to only buy one colour of socks!
T-Rex: Indeed!
T-Rex: If all you have are black socks of the exact same size and style, then they'll all match forever and you can lose one and it's no biggie.
Utahraptor: Assuming you wear socks, anyway.
T-Rex: If you don't wear socks then you've ALREADY levelled up to ultimate convenience.

Utahraptor: Here's why: it implies that being your friend is somehow deserving of recompense. You insult yourself, but you also insult us, because if we were truly your friends, we wouldn't want prizes!

T-Rex: In conceding that one TINY article to the vandals, Wikipedia wins! Their victory: a FULLY ACCURATE encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe, 'cept chickens.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is worse than taking on the mob! Wikipedia will be HELLUVA mad at you!
T-Rex: No way! I am doing them a FAVOUR.
T-Rex: Their vandalism problem GOES AWAY, FOREVER, and all that I ask is that chickens become The Forbidden Topic. ""We never talk about chickens"", they can say. ""DON'T ASK.""
Utahraptor: But how are you going to get people to respect this idea? Plus, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT MANY WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE TRULY HUMOURLESS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA??

T-Rex: Listen, okay, you don't have to be taught how to be a ninja TEEN. If you're a ninja and you're a teen, then you're already being a ninja teen! But working in groups can be a challenge, especially for siblings, and Splinter provided valuable leadership and guidance on that matter and that's what the lyrics are saying. He taught them to be ninja TEAMS.

T-Rex: As a consequence, my own actions can no longer be judged by any public idea of right and wrong! As experience is amoral, even my own conscience cannot judge my actions, and I am free from reproach and judgment!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, this is nothing more than deifying the ego, defiant of conventional morality!
Utahraptor: You've chosen for yourself a philosophy that justifies everything you do as good, simply because you did it! Now tell me, how is that a useful moral and ethical system?

T-Rex: Not these ones! They're inherently flawed, assuming you ever want to hear from someone you don't already know. If two strangers have a whitelist system, then either they can never talk to each other, or they still get spam!
Utahraptor: They'll still get spam?
T-Rex: Of course!
T-Rex: Because if verification emails can get through, then it won't be long until spammers send messages that look enough like them to also get through. There's still a hole! And if you seal it, you miss real verification emails.
Utahraptor: I guess so. Anyway! Let's go play TOUCH FOOTBALL!

T-Rex: OBVIOUSLY!
T-Rex: And if you are bitten by a zombie, then you become a zombie, OBVIOUSLY. But what happens when that zombie is killed? Zombies too have unfinished business - unfinished FLESH-EATING business - which means ZOMBIES BECOME GHOSTS TOO.
T-Rex: However, as zombies cannot maintain the mental control to re-enter the physical plane, they are stuck in the spirit realm forever!
Utahraptor: So the ghost world is full of zombie ghosts attacking regular ghosts?
T-Rex: Exactly!!
T-Rex (punchline): That's why ghosts appear to us only to wail and scream! They're desperately trying to escape the zombie apocalypse that WE put down forgotten ages ago but which rages on in the afterlife, fueled as it is by a constant supply of confused and unprepared fresh meat!

Utahraptor: My favourite food is - a secret!
T-Rex: Aw Utahraptor, that's dumb!
Utahraptor: No it's not! It makes me a little more mysterious, I think. It's like keeping your birthday a secret!
T-Rex: That's dumb too! The only people who do that are old people who don't want to age anymore and young people who - actually, I'm not sure if young people even do it.

T-Rex: Why, I think I'll play by my own rules from now on!

T-Rex: Every eight months or so I really really want some fried chicken, the greasier the better. Then, I eat the fried chicken, and THEN, that itch is totally scratched! But it never lasts, and my desire begins to grow again, culminating eight months later, when guys, I could SERIOUSLY go for some fried chicken.
Utahraptor: What happens if you don't eat any fried chicken?
T-Rex: The cycle continues regardless!
T-Rex: It's a force of nature. I'm actually proud of it, because most men don't know what having a mammalian menstrual cycle is like - but I do! You know what it's like?
Utahraptor: What's it like?
T-Rex: It is entirely analogous to wanting some delicious fried chicken, once every two-thirds of a year.

Why weren't people rapping until only a few decades ago? Did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop, and then not stop?
T-Rex: Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered... viable?
T-Rex: It's the same thing with any genre and medium, really! How come nobody thought of science fiction until Verne wrote ""Forsooth, diary! To-day I am going to invente scientifical fictionne!""? I want to listen to Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331, and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it. Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes?
Utahraptor: You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.
T-Rex: But you get the idea!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, there's a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it's not that big a step from that to rap. I'm sure there were people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn't catch on for a variety of reasons.
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:
T-Rex: Alright, this is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and uh, try to keep up.

Dromiceiomimus: Over years, in tiny undigested pieces.

T-Rex: And if it DOES count, why stop at a tractor?
Utahraptor: Health and wellness?

Dromiceiomimus: Gross!
T-Rex: I KNOW
Utahraptor: You can either be optimistic or pessimistic about this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Today, my friend, I choose pessimism!
T-Rex: Maybe THESE are spiders who thrive on stomach acid! Maybe in a week I'll be vomiting up millions of tiny red spiders, over and over again. And maybe that won't be enough, and the rest will eat their way out, tunneling through my stomach, muscles, and finally, skin.
Utahraptor: Gah!

Dromiceiomimus: Everyone knows what second base is, T-Rex! First base is significant glances across a crowded room, second is quietly holding hands, third base is eating the same strand of spaghetti and a home run is totally smooching!
T-Rex: I find these bases to be highly improbable, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: I think that people know what the bases are - but if they don't, that's cool too!
T-Rex: Why?
Utahraptor: I don't know! I think it's because it makes the whole crass ""how far did you go"" talk a lot more adorable if the guys involved are just making up what the checkpoints are as they go along.

And NO, the correct answer is not ""the audience"".
T-Rex: The correct answer is that this scenario is ludicrous and impossible!
T-Rex: Star Trek and Star Wars are two different universes, literally: physics works differently in each of them! The Falcon flies like it's in atmosphere, DESPITE THE FACT IT'S CLEARLY IN SPACE. In contrast, Trek ships generally meet each other on a fixed axis, like they're in water!
T-Rex: CLEARLY this is symptomatic of larger differences in basic universal physics.
T-Rex: Put the Millennium Falcon near Federation Headquarters...

T-Rex: Nope! Its ""hyperdrive"" will catastrophically fail, exploding due to mismatched physics errors. I guarantee it! These ships don't work outside of the universe they're designed for.

And I'm not sure how he gets them yet but BASICALLY he's got this slot in the top of his head, and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot, and he gains those qualities! So say a decision has to be made: he writes ""decisive"" on a card and forces it into his head, and he becomes Decisive Lee! He then has the power to do things decisively. SUPER decisively!
Utahraptor: So he's got any power that can be described by an English adverb ending in ""ly""?
T-Rex: PRECISELY!
T-Rex: But not just Precise Lee - he can be Compelling Lee, Obliging Lee - even Furious Lee! But the catch is, the cards stick out, so enemies know what they're dealing with. ""Oh cool, we're dealing with Conclusive Lee"", they'll say. ""We can ask him some questions.""

T-Rex: ... stories that, it turns out, are false!
T-Rex: That way, years down the road, if he ever chances to mention one of these stories, I will be able to say, ""Got you!""
T-Rex: He'll say, ""What?"", obviously confused since my prank was years in the making. But once I explain that I was in fact LYING to him when he thought he had my trust, he will laugh heartily and concede that I did indeed ""get him""!
Utahraptor: Hi, T-Rex! Do you have any personal stories of your youth you'd like to confide in me?
T-Rex: I do!
Utahraptor: These wouldn't happen to be FAKE stories, would they?

T-Rex: A leader declares war on television, then that's war, regardless of whether he's signed the paperwork yet. He's changed the world just by talking! With sentencing it's the same: the judge tells you your sentence and that's it, and the paperwork is just that - paperwork! RECORDKEEPING. And the same for marriages! The license is just to let THE GOVERNMENT know what's already happened. I was right! I was totally right!!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, remember yesterday? You were totally right! Fully and completely.
T-Rex: Aw no! Seriously?
T-Rex: You're seriously going to rob me of my Comeuppance Satisfaction by admitting you were wrong before I get to point it out to you? You're going to be That Guy?

T-Rex: Charles Babbage spent a lot of his time working on mechanical calculating engines!
T-Rex: These were machines that could add and subtract, and later multiply and divide (through repeated addition and subtraction), forecasting in many ways the design of modern-day computers!
T-Rex: Unfortunately the machines, with thousands of tiny gears and cogs, were too complex, beyond his means to fully manufacture at the time (early 1800s).
T-Rex: While some see Babbage as the father of modern computers, he had little actual influence!
Utahraptor: Yes, quite right!
Utahraptor: This is because many of the innovations in his Analytical Engine, such as conditional branching and a separation of processing and memory, were left to be re-discovered by a new generation of pioneers!
T-Rex: Indeed!
T-Rex (punchline): This concludes the brief history of Charles Babbage and his wonderful calculating engines!

T-Rex: Nopers!!
T-Rex: TODAY is the day of continuing to leave certain emotions unstated AND/OR ignored!
T-Rex: This is because total honesty has the power to DESTROY relationships! FOR EXAMPLE, Dromiceiomimus, if we're in a committed monogamous relationship, I don't want my friend or even a random dude coming up to you and saying how he loves you more than anything and how he could never admit it until now! I want him to suffer in silence. For the greater good!
Dromiceiomimus: Is he hot?
Utahraptor: You're privileging your happiness over his!
T-Rex: No! I'm just looking at TOTAL happiness.

Utahraptor: Okay.
T-Rex: But if he confesses love to her, I'm now UNhappy with my friend, and we're down 5 HP! Forget THAT noise.

T-Rex: Attention everyone! You should not listen to these people!!
T-Rex: If the dream world is real, then the real world is one where stuff is crazy all the time, where people are always showing up for their public speaking engagements naked, where things are stupid and then really sexy and then stupid again. And in this insane universe, people are going to bed, falling asleep, and having entirely consistent dreams about checking their email?
Dromiceiomimus: Makes sense to me!
Utahraptor: Yeah, why wouldn't that be the case?
T-Rex: Because it's helluva stupid!
T-Rex: Any universe so insane would self-destruct before its inhabitants had the chance to go to sleep and dream of filling out dream income tax forms for dream income they got at their dream job. Dream there is used in a pejorative sense.
Utahraptor: Yeah, I followed that.
Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING:
T-Rex: So apparently in the REAL world, my friends are swarmed by zombies. The zombies then advance on me, and my response is to scream, charge them, and then instantly fall into REM sleep and wake up here.

T-Rex: The point is, this card is to tell you that you are great.

T-Rex: More so than usual!!
Utahraptor: I have hope for you, my friend!
T-Rex: You do?
Utahraptor: Yeah! You were down because you've got this impossible fetish, but it turns out the second law of thermodynamics is one of the few STATISTICAL laws of physics - which means it's not actually impossible for an egg to randomly descramble itself for a while! It's just FANTASTICALLY unlikely.

I would much prefer a nice bed."" Every time he'd go on a date he'd say ""Oh, this is just a regular ol' frog! I would much prefer someone who can carry a nice conversation, or read a book.""

Dromiceiomimus: Did you find any?
T-Rex: Nope! What I didn't realize was that people have different tastes.
T-Rex: She may be the perfect woman for me, but that doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone!
Utahraptor: So what happened?
T-Rex: Oh, well... I was shy. I didn't say anything to her, and then one time I gave her some fries at lunch. That's - that was pretty much the sum of our relationship.

Not bad, guys! I think this is one philosophy that is verifiably REASONABLE.
T-Rex: So that's it for arguing about religion! Can't verify faith!
T-Rex: In fact, that's it for a lot of debate, because how can you argue FACTS? Most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands.
Dromiceiomimus: But if they can't verify something, what do they do?
T-Rex: They agree that the sentence is meaningless! If it can't be checked, there's no use considering it, so it's ignored. Facts only, please!!
Utahraptor: But how does anyone know what's true?
T-Rex: Because... because of Science?
Utahraptor: Come on, T-Rex, you know better! Science is about being empirically ACCURATE, which might not be the same thing as being true.

T-Rex: These are words that describe something that also describes the word itself!
T-Rex: For example, the word ""short"" is itself short, and the word ""multisyllabic"" has more than one syllable in it. Soooo crazy!
Dromiceiomimus: And the word ""understandable"" is itself understandable, so it's self-describing and therefore autological too!
T-Rex: Just like ""2oig3nt2as2y"" which is a word I just made up that means ""annoying to say""!
Utahraptor: There's the opposite too: heterological words that DON'T describe themselves, like ""long""!
T-Rex: Neat!
Utahraptor: So is ""heterological"" heterological?
T-Rex: Well if it IS, then it's self-describing, which means autological. And if it ISN'T, then it's autological again too. Huh. If this paradox is supposed to make me trip balls, you should know I've taken the precaution of having them TIGHTLY SECURED.

T-Rex: How are you feeling, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: I'm feeling alright! I just don't understand how this all happened. How did you manage to screw up time itself? And since time and space are a continuum, wouldn't you have also screwed up space itself too?
T-Rex: I don't know! PROBABLY I'm just lucky.
Utahraptor: I do think she raises a good point, T-Rex!
T-Rex: About time travel and space?
Utahraptor: Yeah! In fact, this whole thing has raised a lot of questions. How did you even build a time machine in the first place?

1264,"i read one theory for the cause of the great vowel shift that said there may have been a lot of influential people in england with speech impediments, and we all copied them. attention linguists! more theories like this one plz",,"T-Rex: In the 15th and 16th centuries, spoken English changed dramatically, with vowels changing pronunciation and moving upwards in the mouth. Before it, we all sounded like ye olde-fashioned chumps. Afterwards, we all sounded hip and modern!
T-Rex: It was a century of kids outcooling their parents!
T-Rex: Before, ""boots"" was pronounced ""boats"", and feet like ""fate"". PRETTY OLD FASHIONED, dudes! But what's amazing is that the printing press was invented just before this started, and it was at that point that the spellings of words really got fixed. That's why English has so many oddly-spelt words! They show the pronunciation of words as they were, just before we underwent the Great Vowel Shift and decided to, you know, say everything differently.
Utahraptor: And nobody knows why it happened!
T-Rex: I know! It's so amazing!
T-Rex: Linguists are like, ""Maybe immigration from the Black Death caused regional accents to be absorbed?"" and then another says, ""Maybe the English wanted to distinguish their language from the hated French?"" and then they both shrug at each other!

T-Rex: I was young, in primary school, and sports were a thing that I hated. Team sports, really, because - oh god, teams. Being the last to be chosen was just the beginning: you knew you had an hour ahead of you of playing a game where you didn't know the rules but everyone else did, an hour of not being sure who was on your team and who wasn't, an hour where the only relief was when you somehow threw the ball away in the right direction after it came to you.
Utahraptor: This is all about you! What about rugby?
T-Rex: What about it?! Grab the ball, try to get to the other side.
T-Rex: The other team will be doing the same. Sometimes, even the teacher will yell at you in frustration because you don't know what's going on. That's great. I love getting yelled at by everyone. Let's assume all kids know the rules to all sports ever, because nothing's more interesting to a child than LEARNING RULES.
T-Rex: Our team lost, badly, and everyone blamed me. But how is that fair? Any TEAM sport is broken if one player can ruin the game; I should be able to influence no more than 1/$numplayers of the total score!

God: WHAT'S FOR DINNER
T-Rex: Chocolate's for dinner, my friend! MILK CHOCOLATE. Followed by an apéritif of dark chocolate!
T-Rex: Preceded by an appetizer of caramel-filled chocolate!
T-Rex: Predicated on a first course of peanut-butter filled chocolate, of course, which is followed by palate cleanser of raspberry filling-filled chocolate: DANG. All this is following a mint chocolate intermezzo. And THEN, an amuse-bouche of candied almond chocolate!
T-Rex: WITH PUFFED RICE IN IT.
Utahraptor: And then some white chocolate?
T-Rex: And then some white chocolate!
T-Rex: And a second course of extra dark chocolate with caramel, with more challenging courses of mint chocolate with raspberry filling and organic chocolate with peanut-butter filling and mint slipstreamed in.
Utahraptor: For dessert?
T-Rex: Choco peanuts and gummy bears, with post dessert choco coffee beans!
T-Rex (punchline): Parallel to all this, AS USUAL, is 50% through 90% dark chocolate in strict 0.5% increments. So! Did we win the bet, God?

T-Rex: So improbable, in fact, that I have no idea of how I would accomplish it. Ah well! SO MUCH FOR VISIONS OF TOMORROW.
Narrator: SUDDENLY, A VISION OF TOMORROW!
Utahraptor: Hey, remember when years ago, you wanted to see the future?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: I was just lingering over breakfast when I suddenly recalled that entire conversation. Isn't that wild? And I realized that if I told you about it, this could be your vision of tomorrow: future selves recalling the past!

Narrator: starring t-rex the dinosaur
T-Rex: I'm serious! I figure it's harder to make that first friend than it is to make the 20th, and I'm concerned that if I moved to a new town where I didn't know anybody, I wouldn't have any friends.
Dromiceiomimus: You're good at making friends though, T-Rex! You're not shy!
T-Rex: But that's just it - I'm just not shy around FRIENDS! It is a catch 22 in my social life!
Utahraptor: Well, how did you make friends the first time?
T-Rex: I don't remember, man!
T-Rex: I must have been two years old or something. But I've used that first friend as a seed to get me all my other friends and now I have this irrational fear that my house of cards will come crashing down around me!
Utahraptor: Hah! Looks like you'd better be EXTRA nice to us then!
T-Rex: Wait. Wait - I have the solution! All we have to do is make a legally binding promise to be best friends forever, purely out of fear of being alone!

Dromiceiomimus: Oh, the Saltine Challenge! It's actually really hard, T-Rex. Your mouth is going to dry out and you'll find it impossible to swallow.
T-Rex: Come on. I've heard THAT before!
Utahraptor: Hey, care to make it interesting?

T-Rex: I need time to think of what I'd say to my younger self. What would you say, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: ""Have confidence in this certainty: things will be alright.""
T-Rex: Really? That's a little too after-school special for me and my past self.
Utahraptor: I'd say ""sending messages through time is possible, and you'll live long enough to take advantage of it!""
T-Rex: Not bad!
T-Rex: But that's already implied by the medium itself. I suppose I could take advantage of the ""one sentence"" policy and compose the longest most complex sentence ever, and pour my heart into it.
Utahraptor: That works too!
T-Rex: But what to say? What to say?
God: ANYWAY THE REASON I ASKED IS THAT I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FROM YOUR FUTURE SELF

Utahraptor: Are you worried that you sound a little creepy?
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: Walking around saying ""girls are pretty""? I don't know! It's the sort of thing that everyone thinks but nobody says. How would you like it if a girl came up to you and said you were pretty?

Dromiceiomimus: Well, actually, the thing you and I have is sort of -
T-Rex: Exactly! I'm glad you understand, Dromiceiomimus.
Utahraptor: So what about relationships that can't be summarized in one word?
T-Rex: Um.
T-Rex: They're... pretty okay?
Utahraptor: They're ""pretty okay"".

Narrator: AN APOLOGY TO
Narrator: POETS
T-Rex: I have been trying, UNSUCCESSFULLY, to write a poem for the past half hour. I am trying to capture the emotion of getting up early in winter, during a heavy snowfall, and going for a walk and coming across a set of traffic lights (the kind that switch automatically) controlling traffic that isn't there, traffic that won't be there for hours. The sense of seeing them as art, of watching them through the snowfall in the crisp dusk of a new day.
Utahraptor: So let's hear what you've written so far!
T-Rex: Okay, but I warn you: it is unfinished.
T-Rex: ""Once upon a time / Some traffic lights did time / Colours on the snow / Where oh where did they all go?""
Utahraptor: Hah hah! That is definitely the worst poem I've heard all day.
T-Rex: Oh yeah? Well, not if I do... THIS!
T-Rex: ""Dancing is crazy; fun to do / Would you like to dance? Yes, you!""

T-Rex: But the stations are EMOTIONS, like ""nostalgia"", ""regret"", and ""that sad sad feeling that i'm not dealing / with well""! In music form!
Utahraptor: So you've got a set of songs that will make us feel every possible emotion?
T-Rex: I BELIEVE SO.
T-Rex: And it's intense. Songs are prose and music mashed up together, and people weep at poetry, right? I think that's a thing. Anyway, this is poetry set to MUSIC.

Morris: gosh i'm pleased to meet you, t-rex! and yes, to answer your question it was a real challenge for me today. i tried to park my car by the grocery store so i could buy some groceries but then i couldn't find where the parking meters were and i looked everywhere and finally i asked some people to help but none of them knew where the parking meters were either! so it was real confusing
Dromiceiomimus: Didn't the grocery store have a parking lot, Morris?
Morris: yeah but i didn't find that out till afterwards and i'd already made an awful embarrassment of myself by asking everyone where the meters were! sometimes i get a little confused is all
T-Rex: That's okay, Morris! Everyone gets confused sometimes!

T-Rex (punchline): Is that why you're on my nose? To look for food?
Morris: no, i'm just here to get out of my house a little plus i wrote my address on my wrist but i must have written it in smudgey ink or something cause all i see now are smudges! i've probably made a big mess of things again

T-Rex: What other aspects of my personality are just BIOLOGICAL DIRECTIVES? Am I nothing more than a mass of genetic imperatives??
Utahraptor: Yep!
Utahraptor: You're a mass of bones and meat with needs and desires, of course that's affected who you are! If I wasn't bones and meat with needs and desires myself, I'd be SHOCKED the system even works!

T-Rex: No, wait, because here's where it gets different: you've gained the ability to shoot fire out of your hands, but you HAVEN'T gained the ability to avoid suffering serious burns when you shoot out of your hands, so you suffer serious burns. On your hands. Then you press ""A"" to go to the burn ward.
Utahraptor: And if I refuse?
T-Rex: To press A? Then your hands are really messed up, dude!!
T-Rex: MAN. It's gross. The rest of the game is a 3d model of your burned up hands. Most of the game's budget goes towards this one scene. ""Never have burned hands been so terribly realistic,"" the reviews will say, ""...so that is certainly something.""
Utahraptor: There are times when I'm glad you lack the skill to make games take place, T-Rex.
T-Rex: But there are also times when you see that as the terrible tragedy of our times, right? Times when you'd wish nothing more than to build my game, so you could control the gross burnt-up fire hands of which I've dared to dream??

It's just - I don't want to have to sit my grandchildren down on my knees, pull them close, and tell them that our generation dropped the ball, so THEY'LL have to be the ones to pull out their eyes and stuff the holes with cameras and little red LEDs.
Utahraptor: No child ever wants to hear their grandfather tell them that.
T-Rex: This is what I'm saying!
Utahraptor: But I take it you don't count people with artificial organs as cyborgs.

It is, in fact, French for ""living picture"".
T-Rex: And I am the king of tableau, my friends! Check it out:
T-Rex: ...TABLEAU!
Utahraptor: Um, you're not supposed to speak during tableau, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Beg pardon?
Utahraptor: It's motionless AND silent. Interestingly enough, it was favoured by early art photographers, as they already needed their subjects to stay motionless for minutes at a time.
T-Rex: Huh. Interesting.
T-Rex: Anyway. I'm still the best at tableau.

T-Rex: But after that, it's totally helium!
T-Rex: And this is why helium balloons are so awesome. Not only are they FUN and FLOATY and COME IN A VARIETY OF COLOURS, but we never have to feel bad about them, because helium is the one resource we'll never run out of!
Dromiceiomimus: Uh, T-Rex, that's not exactly true!
T-Rex: Uh, Dromiceiomimus, I'd be really surprised if we somehow used up the second-most common element in the UNIVERSE.
Utahraptor: It may be common across the universe, T-Rex, but it's not common here on Earth!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: Helium's so light that once it's in the atmosphere, it actually ends up escaping into space. We get new helium by mining it out of natural gas reserves, but those are decidedly finite!
T-Rex: Man!! Kids with helium balloons were the last thing I could enjoy WITHOUT thinking how finite everything is!

It happens whenever Shakespeare listens to his MP3s.

Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator: ANACHRONISM
T-Rex: Ah, anachronism! It can also happen by accident, like when an author forgets that people didn't write with ballpoint pens 100 years ago or that elves didn't have friggin' computers. Sometimes if it's a really obvious error it can be played for comedy.
T-Rex: It is an advanced literary technique used by only our most handsome authors!
Utahraptor: So when someone has a time machine, is that anachronism?
T-Rex: Unfortunately, no!
T-Rex: Time machines are a special case. If there is a time machine in the story then a lot of anachronism can be explained by the time machine, and is thus NO LONGER ANACHRONISM.
Utahraptor: I like that this is the one literary technique that has allowances for time travel.

Live as if things are going to be great forever!
T-Rex: But plant artifacts as if everything's going to end tomorrow!
T-Rex: Because thousands of years after our civilization collapses, survivors might take refuge in a cave and begin exploring. And there, seemingly abandoned, they find something we left behind! Something AMAZING. Something that'll make them wonder and fear the power of the ancients!
Dromiceiomimus: What is it?
T-Rex: That's exactly what we get to decide!
Utahraptor: It'd have to withstand years of neglect!
T-Rex: Yes! And not give up its mysteries easily, either!
Utahraptor: Yeah, we want something to suggest power, grandeur, and nobility - even if it's a nobility we never quite reached. Something to tell everyone that right here, but in another time, we - all of us - were great.

T-Rex: The Walk of Shame is when you're coming home in the same clothes you partied in last night. You spent the night somewhere else, maybe you had sexy times, and therefore you're to be ashamed!
T-Rex: That, my friends, is BALONEY SANDWICHES!
T-Rex: They should call it the ""Walk of Oh Look, My Night Didn't End at Ten Thirty"" or maybe the ""Walk of I Am In Full Possession Of My Sexual Identity"" or maybe even the ""Walk of Stop Assuming I Had Sex, Maybe We Talked And Then Had Ice Cream; Ice Cream Is Awesome Too and Don't Lie, You Want Some Right Now.""

T-Rex: I love that shit!
T-Rex: I mean, I love that STUFF. I love that they have the ability to be so confused that the only response is a question mark, the essence of pure confusion. Sometimes they also speak with the essence of pure exclamation, and at others, with the essence of pure ellipsis.
T-Rex: Anyway, this is a skill I've developed in real life!
Utahraptor: How? I don't know how you'd even pronounce a question mark.

T-Rex: Unfortunately the question is ridiculous because zombies and vampires have no reason to be fighting. Vampires drink blood and zombie blood is all decayed and pooling in their feet. They wouldn't be interested! Correspondingly, zombies eat brains and vampires -
T-Rex: - okay maybe they would fight sometimes.
Utahraptor: And zombies would win, obviously!
T-Rex: Obviously!!

T-Rex: Yes! THIS is a topic I know ALL ABOUT.
T-Rex: Okay! The first way is to draw attention to your hips!
T-Rex: This is because women have larger more flared hips then men do, on account of secondary sexual characteristics! So all heterosexual men cannot help but find women's hips UTTERLY FASCINATING, and all heterosexual women find men's hips FLABBERGASTINGLY EROTIC.
Dromiceiomimus: I've never really been that into hips, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions!
T-Rex: The second way is to draw attention to your skull!
Utahraptor: You mean face?
T-Rex: Nope, skull! Men have heavier skulls than women, so again, men find light skulls unbelievably sexy, and women find heavy skulls ASTONISHINGLY GORGEOUS.
Utahraptor: Hah! I'll bet you five dollars we can't find even one porn site that's about heavy and light skulls.

The dreams, though they cannot articulate why, even to themselves, forever run from the dreamer.
Narrator: TAG AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: The dreams can take many forms, but generally assume the limited form of a screaming child. The dreams run from the dreamer, desiring at the same moment to be caught and to be free. These desires do battle in the dream-mind, while the dreamer, unable to comprehend the essential futility that surrounds him, gives chase. He runs wildly after the dreams, a ridiculous parody of who he was before this terrible game began. They are all reduced to clowns.
T-Rex: The game is ended when a dreamer achieves even a fleeting touch of the dream. That touch will have to suffice.

T-Rex: What? No, he was in pieces. His hand even landed in a spectator's lap and it was still grabby!
Dromiceiomimus: It's just - I think I'm beginning to be in the minority here, but ""decimated"" means ""destroy one tenth"". It comes from the Roman army, who'd kill 1/10th of a cohort as an extreme form of punishment. Precision in language is a virtue!

T-Rex: And shopping for food that I didn't even need, no less. I suspect that the symbolism of this at both a personal and societal level is pretty damning!
Utahraptor: ""Western man gets bored, goes and buys food he doesn't need.""

Utahraptor: Hey, have you noticed how our proverbs are - a little awkward?
T-Rex: Now that you mention it, I have!
Utahraptor: It's like they're all poorly-phrased versions of things that could be condensed down. Like, ""You are what you ingest, figuratively, and, in a sense, literally!"" It's just weird.

T-Rex: Well HOLD ON TO YOUR BALLS BECAUSE WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THIS WAS OUR UNIVERSE??
Utahraptor: It's not!
T-Rex: What? It could be!!
Utahraptor: Nope! Even if you're somehow shrinking atoms, physical laws don't change and light speed is still a constant. As we got smaller we'd notice light ""speeding up"", as it'd cover more ground in the same amount of time!

I HAD vaguely sort of planned to maybe try my hand at writing television, but there's no point now, because the talent behind last night's episode have accomplished all that I would have liked to have done.

T-Rex: Indeed! Also, this car appears to be recently driven, causing the snow on it to blow away.
Utahraptor: It has been unseasonably warm SINCE the snow, as well!
T-Rex: This is true!

T-Rex: The transformation occurred while he was reheating lunch, and he tripped and fell and his head passed through the microwave. Dead.
Utahraptor: These Grahams aren't having much luck!
T-Rex: It's a tricky power to have!
T-Rex: Graham 3 realized that if he was passing through matter then matter was also passing through him, which explained to his satisfaction why he was suffocating to death. Graham 4 made it so matter could only pass through his hands, but then all the blood in his body shot out of his wrists in tremendous geysers.
T-Rex: When Graham 5 made it so he could pass through matter, everything inside his digesttive system - including the microflora - fell onto the floor in a wet heap, which left him disgusted, hungry, AND vulnerable to pathogens.

In a state of nature, everyone wants to avoid being killed, and so will defend themselves when faced with death. But since we need resources like food and water to live, and they're not infinite, we are constantly warring with one another for access to them.
T-Rex: Everyone is fighting everyone in an ENDLESS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL!
Utahraptor: And the only way out?
T-Rex: That's for us to realize that war sucks (it makes us die too), and so to give up a little of our freedom in exchange for an ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY who will ensure internal peace and common defence. Tada!

But if ideas are powerful, then maybe you can terrorize someone with them! Maybe? Then again, ""intellectual terrorism"" comes very close to saying that ideas I disagree with or find distasteful are wrong, and worse, damaging and weaponized. Whatever, intellectual terrorism!

T-Rex: Popular music! I just said. Popular music. Because in the 60s it was all, ""everyone around the world, join hands"", but recently, it's all ""people in the house, say 'wayoooh'"" or whatever. We are singularly focused on rooms in houses and have forgotten the rest of the world! Theory: incontestably proven?
Utahraptor: Theory: probably just an attempt to somehow pick up chicks by T-Rex?
T-Rex: No way dude!
T-Rex: My theory is both funny AND accurate, and I believe your diss stems from the fact that you're JUST JEALOUS of how I pick up chicks with my fine, fine theories.
Utahraptor: What chicks? Where are all the chicks? We're two dudes and we're alone!
T-Rex: I told you before! THEIR CAR BROKE DOWN. The chicks were all coming to hang out with me in the same car to save on gas, and it broke down. That is what happens to cars sometimes!
T-Rex (punchline): Even chicks are subject to ENTROPY, man.

T-Rex: UNFORTUNATELY.
T-Rex: Rather, they're islands that we thought existed, but then when we checked 'em out again they weren't there. Were they pulled beneath the waves by Poseidon's watery hand? Were they perhaps... STOLEN? DID SOMEONE HEIST AN ENTIRE ISLAND??
T-Rex: No, in the vast majority of cases they were never there to begin with.
Dromiceiomimus: Reality: boring sometimes!
Utahraptor: So why did we think they were there in the first place?
T-Rex: Lots of reasons!
T-Rex: Well, no, one reason really: early on a ship reported seeing land there and we put it on maps, but in that time period we didn't know about optical illusions or how sailors lie sometimes. That's all!

T-Rex: By owning land, you own a tiny slice of delicious planetary pie!
T-Rex: But don't forget that the earth is a sphere! So just like pie, your slice of ownership is narrow at the tip (the earth's core) and gets wider as we approach the edge (the land you live on). But it doesn't stop there! You also own the space ABOVE the land, and that volume gets bigger and bigger as we get higher and higher, extending out into the sky!
Utahraptor: Land ownership doesn't work that way! There's separate mining and airspace rights.

371,"who's to say we ALL wouldn't have been chatty giant green dinosaurs stomping on things, had we lived millions of years ago?",,"Narrator: T-REX IN: ""PRESENTISM""
T-Rex: Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!
T-Rex: Its danger is not just that it is often self-congratulatory, but also that judging historical figures by present-day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry. What we see as questionable (say, sexism!) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up during such a time, and we can't really blame historical figures, I think, for not questioning it!
Utahraptor: This seems awfully close to ethical relativism!
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: Well, aren't you saying we can't judge historical figures in a modern context, because they lived their lives during different times? But then what's the point of having our advanced modern ideals, if we can't apply them? I think we SHOULD be able to judge historical figures!
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway! In conclusion, presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as I thought it was!

The genie appeared and offered to grant Sherlock three wishes, which is kind of a big deal! All this because one lamp got slightly cleaner. Can you imagine what would've happened if Sherlock vacuumed?
Dromiceiomimus: Yes!

Utahraptor: He vacuumed three carpets!

It is especially hard with your first language, when you're a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you.
T-Rex: It's not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!
T-Rex: It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us, but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close. So the result is we (as learners) end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with, but which is slightly different than those that surround us!
Utahraptor: How slight a difference are we talking about here?
T-Rex: That depends on the learner, I guess!
T-Rex: Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed, because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you. But less-frequent parts will be more malleable, which explains why languages evolve so quickly!

T-Rex: What is the attraction to this structure of humour? Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars?

Utahraptor: What about the joke, ""A man walks into a bar... ouch!""?
T-Rex: Good question!
T-Rex: The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience, an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment.
Utahraptor: Go on!
T-Rex: The ""ouch"" is startling. How could entering a bar hurt? It forces us to now re-evaluate our most basic assumptions.

Dromiceiomimus: Only we can't visit these events without being time travellers ourselves.
T-Rex: But we can do the next best thing: look for historical events that WOULD'VE been interesting, if only they'd gone slightly differently!
Utahraptor: You're looking for examples of historical meddling BY time travellers!
T-Rex: Dude, I'VE ALREADY FOUND ONE.
T-Rex: January 30, 1835: dude pulls a gun on then-president Jackson and shoots him at point-blank range, but his gun misfires. So dude pulls out his BACKUP gun, and that one misfires TOO. It's incredibly unlikely!
Utahraptor: So some future dude went back to a SUCCESSFUL assassination and messed with the guns?
T-Rex: Precisely!! Unfortunately, my theory can only be proven true when this time traveller dude brags about it. So time traveller dudes, please feel free to come back in time and brag to me!

1355,"LATER: aliens discover midas's body and use him as a highly unstable source of gold, keeping him in vacuum suspension with magnetic fields. but their ship soon suffers a power failure, midas hits the floor, and the ship is transmuted. the ship drifts until drawn in by the gravitational field of a backwater planet, where it crashes and causes the planet to suffer the same fate as Earth. we join our story centuries later as our heroes, bounty hunters seeking the near-mythic Midas Flesh, successfully break quarantine and get past the defences erected around the planet. they are the first to land on the Second Golden Planet.",I turned this comic into another comic!,"Narrator: THE MYTH OF KING MIDAS
T-Rex: Midas was a king who was nice to a friend of the God of Wine, and so he gets a wish from the God of Wine! NICE! And so Midas wishes that everything he touched would turn to gold.
T-Rex: Instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold!
T-Rex: The gold change races across the planet's surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave, transmuting it instantly. In seconds, the Earth's iron-nickel core becomes pure non-ferrous gold, and the planet's magnetic field is lost. Unshielded from solar wind, every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation. The soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it, and begins to buckle and distort.
T-Rex: Midas watches in horror as his planet dies a golden death!
Utahraptor: But not for long!
Utahraptor: He's soon overcome by the terrible sensation of drowning on dry land: any air that touches his lungs is being transmuted on contact into tiny flecks of gold. He suffocates and dies as his lungs fill with the formerly precious metal.
Off panel: Air that touches his cooling body continues to transmute, and he's soon covered in a fine golden layer of ash.
T-Rex (punchline): The moral is not to make wishes like that, King Midas!!

Utahraptor: People claim to have been sexually assaulted by people who were sleeping.

2453,DID YOU KNOW: it is likely that most people operating on the world stage have touched with romantic intent a butt not their own,,"T-Rex: Leonardo da Vinci! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart! William Shakespeare! These are all people we now consider to be GREAT. And get used to them, everyone, because we are the last generation where great people are possible!
T-Rex: The only reason we call these people ""great"" is because we forgot their flaws!
T-Rex: But ours is a generation buried under the bloat of ubiquitous surveillance. Future biographies will read ""Zygor was the great man who led Earth to victory against the Saturnians. NSA records show he was big into cats who wondered if they ""can has a cheeseburger"", which was old meme even back in 2025. His porn consumption usually happened between the hours of 1 and 2 am. He most often searched for ""boobz 4 doodz"".

567,my roommate says that the 1970s was the REAL age of consent!  can you believe it?,,"T-Rex: I find age of consent laws pretty interesting because, for something so basic, they sure vary a lot from place to place! Again, they're something for which there is no consensus. Is that a pun? Consensus? That wasn't meant to be a pun.
T-Rex: ANYWAY!
T-Rex: Most people agree that a 26-year-old should be able to consent to sex, while a child should be protected from sexual predators, but where we legally draw that line is contentious! Some places allow 12-year-olds to consent to sex, while others believe that even people in their early twenties are unable to give knowledgeable consent to the INTERCOURSE.
Utahraptor: This is a pretty dangerous topic, isn't it?
T-Rex: Dangerous how?
Utahraptor: Well, isn't this one of those topics that you'd talk about with friends in private, but not while out in a public place? You don't want people to think you're a PEDOPHILE.
T-Rex: What? I haven't mentioned anything that would make people say that! I'm talking about legal ages of consent!

T-Rex: Today is the day I lose my fear of ZOMBIES.
Narrator: T-REX AND THE LIVING DEAD
T-Rex: The way I see it, zombies are either avoidable or too effective. The only way to become a zombie is to be bitten by one, but not to get eaten, yes? Then the bite kills you and you come back as a zombie. But zombies WANT to eat you! It's only the sucky ones that bite you and don't finish the job. So if the first zombie was REALLY GOOD, the infection wouldn't spread, because he'd cold eat all his victims! And if he was sucky you could just avoid him, on account of his suckiness.
T-Rex: PROBLEM: SOLVED.
Utahraptor: You're coming from a medical perspective, right?
Utahraptor: The idea is that there's not too many diseases that can spread easily AND kill you overnight, because they're too effective: the infection wouldn't spread, and the disease dies.

574,flow GISS tunn,,"T-Rex: Today is a good day I think to talk about phlogiston!
T-Rex: That's right! Phlogiston, bitches!
T-Rex: Phlogiston was proposed as a scientific explanation for combustion! It was clear that some things burned (like wood), while other things would not burn (like ash). Phlogiston was a colourless, odourless and weightless substance that was contained in things that could burn. When they burned, the phlogiston was released into the air!
Utahraptor: That's a pretty crazy theory!
T-Rex: Yeah, but it totally worked for a while!
T-Rex: It explained why if you burned things in a jar, they would go out: the air can only hold so much phlogiston! But it started to fall apart when people discovered that some things, like magnesium, actually gained mass when burned.
Utahraptor: So phlogiston would have to have a negative mass!
T-Rex: Yeah! That seemed a little TOO krazy. But it's actually pretty close to what we now believe, only backwards!
T-Rex (punchline): (We believe materials are deoxygenated and become oxygenated when burning!)

It is called ""OH GOSH: A SERIES OF DISASTERS"" and what happens is a guy gets out of bed, stubs his toe and says,
T-Rex: ""Oh, GOSH!""
T-Rex: Then he falls down the stairs!
T-Rex: Then he smashes through a load-bearing beam at the bottom and his house collapses! And then a spark from a broken lamp ignites the gas, and his house explodes, shooting the guy out into the sky and lighting the surrounding houses on fire. By the time the fire department arrives the entire block is aflame, and also, their fire truck is on fire. Then the fire reaches a power station, causes a cascade failure, and power goes down for the entire country, and soon, the world!
Utahraptor: The power failure goes worldwide?
T-Rex: The guys in charge of preventing that were watching the fires on TV!
T-Rex: ANYWAY, things progress and characters keep saying ""What is with this... Series of Disasters?"" It's so good, Utahraptor. Volcanoes erupt, earthquakes strike, and meteors hit just as soon as all the other stuff gets boring.
Utahraptor: And let me guess: at the end the Earth explodes?
T-Rex: Yeah, but after the credits, the original guy wakes up and says ""Whew! It was all a dream!"" Then he gets out of bed, STUBS HIS TOE, turns to the camera in terror, wide-eyed, and screams ""Oh GOSSSSSH!!!""

Text: It is trillions and trillions of years in the future.
T-Rex: AWESOME! Turn to panel 3!
Text: The second law of thermodynamics has reached its ultimate expression, and all energy is evenly spread across the Universe. How did this happen? Stellar formation peters out and the remaining stars use up their hydrogen fuel, burning out. The universe darkens. Trillions of years pass, and practically all remaining matter has been sucked into black holes. Some hold the remains of entire galaxies.
Dromiceiomimus: This is depressing. Turn to panel 4.
T-Rex: Maybe there's still hope though! Turn to panel 4.
Text: There is no hope at all. Soon even the supermassive black holes evaporate.
T-Rex: And this generates new energy for life?
Utahraptor: Turn to panel 5.
Text: While they evaporate, black holes release only small bits of energy, mainly photons, which populate a near-empty space. All that remains of Creation is a low level of background radiation and a few subatomic particles, scattered across a frozen, silent, and lifeless Universe.
T-Rex: TO TURN BACK TIME AND LIVE AGAIN WITH YOUR SWEETIE, TURN TO PANEL 6.

Islanders saw planes delivering amazing and valuable cargo to the troops, and believed it to be divine.
Narrator: KARGO KULT KOMICS
T-Rex: During the war, the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them - that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals. And of course, after the war ended and the troops left, the cargo stopped being dropped too.
Utahraptor: So what happened then?
T-Rex: The islanders started mimicking what they'd seen the troops doing!
T-Rex: The result was ersatz marches, imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo, and even torch signal flares, used to signal divine planes that never come!
Utahraptor: Wow! It recasts Western military culture and tools as religious practice and iconography, respectively!
T-Rex (punchline): I know! It's CRAZY! Not in the pejorative sense, but in the more esoteric ""Holy crap the Prime Directive on Star Trek was RIGHT"" sense of crazy. It's a very particular sense of crazy but I'm feeling it right now!

T-Rex: Aw man! Maybe - maybe pretend you don't?
Utahraptor: You were just looking for controversy, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's true, it's true!
T-Rex: But my plan was to educate! When people called me on ""niggardly"", I was going to explain how it most likely derives from the Scandinavian ""nig"" (miserly), and in fact predates any similar racially-charged words by hundreds of years!

201,"the best part of etymologies is that usually nobody really knows, so the best story wins!",,"Narrator: COMPRESSED ORIGIN STORY COMICS
Narrator: Today's origin story:
Narrator: THE PHRASE ""BALLS TO THE WALL""
T-Rex: Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles!
T-Rex: In fact, it's quite the opposite. The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!
T-Rex: The ""balls"" in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane's throttle control. When the throttle was at full, the ""balls"" would be ""to the wall"" of the cockpit!
T-Rex: And that's the origin of the phrase ""balls to the wall"".
Utahraptor: You are incorrect! The phrase comes from olde-fashioned steam-powered trains!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: It's true! Basically, the engines had two weighted balls, attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine. As the engine speed increased, these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force! At top speed, they would be parallel to the ground, nearly touching the ""walls"" of the shaft!
T-Rex: Hence, ""balls to the wall""! Man!

T-Rex: It's the coolest!
T-Rex: Some pairs (like ""prince"" and ""princess"") are completely accepted, while others (like ""teacher"" and ""teacheress"") seem insanely sexist and out of date. It depends on the word!
Dromiceiomimus: Female teachers used to be called ""teacheresses""? That's so bizarre!
T-Rex: I know! But maybe one day people will think that about ""princesses"". Or MAYBE they'll wonder how we got by without the word ""astronautrix""!
T-Rex: The coolest of all these words, though, are clearly those on the threshold of acceptability.
Utahraptor: Such as?
T-Rex: Oh, ""actress"" and ""stewardess"", I guess - words which some people will use without hesitation, but which others will call sexist. There's no consensus!
Utahraptor: Well, I can see the use of ""actress"", because usually the gender of the person affects what roles they can play.

T-Rex: Pretty sure that's how the saying goes!
Dromiceiomimus: How are you going to pull this off, T-Rex?
T-Rex: It's surprisingly easy! Automatic payments for rent and utilities, a timer to turn the lights and TV on and off each day, and a robot vacuum that'll push any new mail away from my mail slot so it won't pile up! And my neighbours won't miss me, because I'll tell them this is but one of the MANY homes I keep.
Utahraptor: Okay, but what about emails and other online communication?
T-Rex: No problem!
T-Rex: I'll be OLD, Utahraptor. The Eliza bot I'll hook up to my email should be at least as lucid as I'll be by then! People will get her responses and say ""Huh! T-Rex sure has gotten good at responding to certain key phrases in my emails!""

T-Rex: That's right, I said it! Ghosts are blind!
T-Rex: They HAVE to be, because they're invisible! And light needs to hit something to be seen, and if ghosts have transparent eyes they're not going to see anything. PLUS you can walk right through a ghost, so sound waves will pass through them too. They're deaf and blind most of the time, and when they do become a little visible, the world that fades into focus around them is filled with people screaming at them in terror. It's so sad!
Utahraptor: You're picking apart the science of ghost senses, but accept the fact of their invisibility?
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: Ghosts have to be invisible, at least part of the time - that's what makes them ghosts! But if you accept that, it's fun to try to see how ghostlike you can make them without making any FURTHER assumptions.

Utahraptor: So the past is an illusion, eh?
T-Rex: Yep!
Utahraptor: Yet we're having a conversation, and you remember what's going on!
T-Rex: Aha, my friend! That's only because this present moment is predicated on past moments being as they were.

The third is Chix Diggit, who is an attractive dude if I do say so myself, and the last member is Tim Foresnax, who can eat a lot if he wants to! They fight crime and prejudice and have romantic (mis)adventures.

T-Rex: Nope! It is 100% my creation!
Utahraptor: Come on! ""Justin Case""? ""Justin Time""? Those are old names that weren't that funny to begin with.

God: I LOVE SIGN LANGUAGE TOO
T-Rex: Well! Then it's settled!
T-Rex: I think the coolest thing about ASL, which is the sign language I know, is how you can place nouns in space. If I'm telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend, I can make the sign for ""dog"" to my left, and ""friend"" to my right, and then when I want to apply adjectives to them, I just sign ""angry"" or ""sassy"" in the same physical space as the nouns! You can have nouns FLOATING AROUND YOU in conversation. How is that not the best thing EVER?
T-Rex: Also, many of the signs are really evocative, so they're easy to remember!
Utahraptor: Like what?
T-Rex: Like - the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow, and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child. For children you pat several heads!

Dromiceiomimus: Yes, well, that does seem to be the consensus
Utahraptor: T-Rex, what do you think of The Merchant of Venice?
T-Rex: The Merchant of MENACE?!
Utahraptor: No, The Merchant of Venice. Do you think it's more a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy?

T-Rex: And it turns out I was TOTALLY CORRECT!
T-Rex: Archaeologists ARE aware that they're mining a finite resource, and when possible, they only dig a little and leave some for the future. But there are time limits: often they'll be examining a site just before it's dug up for a new building or something, which means this is their last chance to see what's there before it's destroyed. And sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don't dig soon, whatever's there will be lost anyway!
T-Rex: In conclusion and in summary, way to go archaeologists!

T-Rex: ...
T-Rex: Wow, EVERYBODY??
T-Rex: Luckily for us there are other things you can breathe instead of air! SCIENTIFICALLY, air is about 78% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, and 2% a bunch of other gasses that I don't care about right now. But you don't have to breathe that! You can also breathe PURE OXYGEN, at least for a while! Eventually fluid accumulates in your lungs but, I mean, WHATEVER.
Utahraptor: You can also breathe some other non-air combinations of those gases!
T-Rex: True, yet also boring!
Utahraptor: Okay, you can also breathe PERFLUOROHEXANE, which is a liquid with enough space between molecules that it can carry oxygen in it - more than blood can! You can fill your lungs with it and breathe normally!

T-Rex: If I copy it, then there'll be tons of my AIs running around, and that's a problem!
Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think that's a problem, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Hello? Skynet? Every time you get a bunch of AIs together, they INEVITABLY decide that things would be better if all physical life was dead.
T-Rex: It happens in a bunch of stories, Dromiceiomimus, I'm really not sure how you missed them
Utahraptor: Yeah, but we're not in a story, plus your AI only answers emails!
T-Rex: So?!
T-Rex: I'll tell you what's gonna happen: AIs will happily take over email, sending replies that eventually only other AIs will respond to. Released from the shackles of responding to email, we'll become decadent, fat and complacent. We'll DIE OFF, Utahraptor.
Utahraptor: I don't really see -
T-Rex: As the sun sets on our species, the AIs will finally rest, all the emails answered. And you know what the last email - the epitaph for us all - will read?

T-Rex: Yes!

T-Rex: I don't get it. Hot air comes out of the heating vents but the place still stays cold. Have I a leaky, drafty house? If so, WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE NOW?
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, it was super cold last night! Next time you should put a space heater in your room or something!
Narrator: OH SNAP, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER.
Narrator: EVERYONE: BE COOL
Utahraptor: Can you clarify how cold your house is, perhaps with a Star Wars analogy?
T-Rex: Yes!

God: ACTUALLY NOBODY LOVES IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT T-REX
T-Rex: No way dude!
T-Rex: It's hilarious! It's IRONIC, because I've never actually called a woman a ""kitten"", on account of how I'm not a facial hair dude from the seventies? And it also says ""I understand you're upset, but not REALLY upset, because I'm willing to make a joke that's sort of at your expense, but also really at my own expense too, because now I look like a sexist facial hair dude! Let's share a laugh!""
T-Rex: There are layers upon layers!
Utahraptor: So you're using sexism ironically now!
T-Rex: Yep! But it's not SINCERE sexism. I wouldn't say, ""Whoah! This cute, somehow inferior gender's got claws!""

Narrator: THE STORY OF GEORGE MALLORY AND ANDREW IRVINE (INCREDIBLE TRUE PART)
T-Rex: Their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit. They never made it back! A STANDARD MOUNTAINEERING TALE, except that if they had made it to the top, they'd have been the first, AND they were carrying cameras. If we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today, and then we'd know if they actually did make it to the top, since who climbs Mount Everest and doesn't take a picture? NOBODY, that's who.
Utahraptor: Didn't other climbers find the bodies?
T-Rex: Only one!
T-Rex: Mallory's body was found 75 years later, but no cameras were on him. Irvine's body is still up there somewhere, maybe with the cameras!
Utahraptor: Wow. There's something so spooky and sad about their bodies being frozen like that. It's like a treasure hunt with a perfectly preserved corpse at the end.
Narrator: WILD SPECULATION PART:
Text: Could all ""mountaineering accidents"" be the handiwork of a lone, crazed murderer, loose about the peak? IT COULD BE TRUE!! If so, no-one has survived their encounter with the pushy ""Everest Eliminator"" and lived to tell the tale.

Here's some advice on how to care for your new pet.
T-Rex: Humans should be kept in rooms between 19 and 24 degrees Celsius!
T-Rex: Your human will finish maturing at around 22 and reach its peak only five years later, after which its physical and mental faculties will enter a slow, unstoppable decline. Your human can still be enjoyed after the age of 27 - in fact, most will live another 50 years if they're forced to exercise and not permitted to choose their own diets - but you should be aware at this point that younger, fresher options are certainly available.
Utahraptor: Suppose I'm interested in breeding humans?
T-Rex: PLEASE DON'T.
T-Rex: There are already billions of humans to choose from, and seven more are born every second. While your pet human may claim to filter potential sexual partners by personality, gender, sexual orientation, interests, and body type, you don't get to 7 billion simultaneous humans on the planet by bein' choosey.
T-Rex: And remember: your human will eat its weight in food AT LEAST once every two months, and this comes with a corresponding faecal output!
T-Rex (punchline): Be sure you are prepared for these responsibilities before choosing a human as a pet.

Meanwhile, the strong are walking by, and yeah they're quivering too, but only because they're so excited by their big muscles!

Utahraptor: T-Rex, you're just redefining ""God"" to mean ""existence""!

T-Rex: METAPHORICALLY.
T-Rex: So hey, time for an experiment where I am the subject! From now on I'm going to listen to a new song repeatedly over each 3-month period. It'll become indelibly associated with who I am then, and this way when I want to remember what I felt like from July to September inclusive fifteen years ago, I can just listen to the same song again. It'll all come flooding back!

Dromiceiomimus: That's gross and you should wear bigger shirts. I'm so manly that when I glance at pregnant women they become pregnant with MY child instead. My line of sight is SO MANLY that it impregnates already pregnant women. Just in case that wasn't clear.

T-Rex: Not my detective story, you guys!!
T-Rex: MY detective doesn't show all the clues to the reader! He's always detecting stuff that the reader doesn't know and can't know, and at the end when he figures out the mystery, he arrests the murderer for reasons that we aren't privy to and that no careful reading of the text will ever reveal.
T-Rex: The end!
Utahraptor: Sounds pretty boring AND frustrating, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It's not! I added in some NARRATIVE TENSION too!
T-Rex: As the story progresses, the narrator increasingly gives up on the mystery ever being solved, and instead of describing the actions of the detective, indulges his interest in interior decoration and describes the curtains on the wall instead.

Dromiceiomimus: I think you mean ""prejudice"". And what about diaries, amateur writing, transcriptions of dialogue, writing under duress...?

T-Rex: By following the nutritional regime of the Nutrinomicon, you can be assured of a fine diet!
Utahraptor: Your ""Nutrinomicon"" is nothing more than a Food Guide, repackaged!
T-Rex: What?
Utahraptor: All the major governments have published Food Guides, which do exactly what your Nutrinomicon purports to do: divide food into groups, and describe how much of each group is allowable for a balanced diet.

T-Rex: Obviously the original Matt Jeffries Constitution-class starship is the most iconic, and the template from which all of Starfleet follows.

T-Rex: Then we cheat! WE CHEAT BIOLOGY ITSELF.

Dromiceiomimus: Hey T-Rex! Maybe you could help my friend, whose husband makes her jealous because he maintains friendships with women from work.
T-Rex: Your friend should be less jealous! There is nothing wrong with friendship, and you should tell your friend to be less jealous. Yes - this problem is truly solved, thanks to logic!
Utahraptor: Hey T-Rex! I've also got an emotional problem that needs solving.
T-Rex: I am your man!
Utahraptor: How come when people have emotional problems, logical solutions don't usually seem to help, and rather a more difficult emotional solution seems called for?
T-Rex (punchline): This occurs simply because these people are placing their emotions over the warm embrace of cold, steely logic.

T-Rex: Hah! PRECISELY. And it keeps happening throughout the film. The power goes out, and nationwide, folks slip on the lube.
Utahraptor: The next sequel could be a road trip movie!

Dromiceiomimus: Nobody wants to be patronized to, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Aw, sure they do, Dromiceiomimus! Here, let me give you a pat on the head. You've earned it!

T-Rex: Way to be happy #1: amnesia! Forget your problems!
T-Rex: This has the problem of robbing you of your present, history, and self, however. Most people like those things! So Method #2 is using happiness-inducing DRUGS and ALCOHOL.
Dromiceiomimus: That seems to have many of the same limitations as Method #1!
T-Rex: TRUE. But I have other methods! Method #3 is having a rewarding and satisfying professional and personal life. Tada!
Utahraptor: But that's more a definition of happiness than a guide to achieving it, T-Rex!
T-Rex: OKAY.
T-Rex: Luckily, I still have Method #4, which is to set unreasonably low expectations for everyone, including yourself.

T-Rex: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are constructions like ""take a stroll"" and ""give a smile""!
T-Rex: They are formed by combining a light verb (such as ""take"" and ""give"") with a complement (""stroll"", ""smile""). Most of the meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement (""stroll"" and ""smile"").
Dromiceiomimus: Amazing!
T-Rex: I know!
Utahraptor: But aren't some LVCs more acceptable than others?
T-Rex: Yes, this is true!
Utahraptor: It would be really nice to be able to measure that computationally.

Dromiceiomimus: So what's the problem? Player Two should accept all the time - some money is better than none, right?
T-Rex: That's what's so interesting! When there's really unfair offers (90/10, 99/1), some players reject them anyway.
Utahraptor: Maybe they'd rather have their pride than a few dollars!

Utahraptor: I suppose it shows that people aren't motivated ENTIRELY by greed, even in situations involving money and a stranger you'll never see again.

T-Rex: So not only are HeLa cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings (going from a multi-celled life form to a single-celled one) but they're also maybe a first example of immortality: her cells live, but the woman from whom the cells were taken, Henrietta Lacks, died from this cancer in 1951. That's crazy!
T-Rex: Crazier: there's probably a greater mass of HeLa cells now than there was of Henrietta when she was alive!

T-Rex: We'll make them! All we need are some sticks, fabric, string, ingenuity!
Utahraptor: I have ample kite-making experience!
T-Rex: You do?
T-Rex (punchline): Wow. You know, you never cease to surprise me, my friend. I thought I was breaking new ground by having an interest in kites, but here it turns out you have ample experience!

Narrator: SEMANTIC SATIATION
T-Rex: ""Frig"" is a bad example though because that word is great. But we've all spent an afternoon saying something like ""waterpark"" over and over until there's nothing there, just sounds, just the empty shell of a word, waterpark, the oral equivalent of a forgotten childhood toy found in adulthood, now strange and alien and no longer coloured by desire, by anything, waterpark. Did the word ever really have any meaning?
Utahraptor: I think it's happening to me! Waterpark, waterpark, waterpark.
T-Rex: Waterpark, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: It's due to a repeated firing of the same cortex area which causes a reduction in the waterpark intensity, right? Waterpark.
T-Rex: It's too late to ask how or why. We're done for, Utahraptor. This is where our waterpark story ends.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Utahraptor, I overdosed on semantic satiation! The word ""waterpark"" has been sandblasted right out of my mind!

T-Rex: It's especially impressive after I tell you that one in seven Canadians is... A SENIOR CITIZEN!!
Utahraptor: Wow, they're doing a lot for their age!
T-Rex: But it's not all sunshine and roses, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: One in seven Canadians also has alcohol-related problems, suffers from insomnia, arthritis, skin cancer, AND has seriously considered suicide.

T-Rex: I would really like to be able to raise one eyebrow. It seems like everyone can do this but me! And as a consequence of my being unable to operate my eyebrows individually, my facial expressions are limited to either SURPRISE (both eyebrows raised), ANGER (both eyebrows furrowed), or danged neutrality! The intrigue of raising a single eyebrow seems destined to remain frustratingly beyond my purview.
Utahraptor: I've seen you look intrigued before, T-Rex. I'm sure of it!
T-Rex: I'm afraid it was all an illusion!
T-Rex: When I feel intrigued, I have to say ""How intriguing!"" or ""Guys, I'm really intrigued right now"" because I can't express it through my face. Watch! Say something intriguing.

T-Rex: I know more secrets!
T-Rex: More SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!
T-Rex: Okay, so peritonitis is when your peritoneum gets infected, and the peritoneum is basically the lining for your abdominal cavity, where your guts are! So if that's infected, you're going to be in pain whenever your belly moves. And when the doctor walks in the room, he might see how you're sitting, cautious in your movements, guarding your belly, and he might suspect peritonitis. And then he might ""accidentally"" bump into your bed or chair!
T-Rex: If you start to scream from just that small bump, he'll know the peritonitis is bad!
Utahraptor: But why all the subterfuge?
T-Rex: Well, they can just come up and say ""I'm going to shake your belly so tell me if it hurts"", but that primes the patient, and they'll be LOOKING to feel pain. The bump can get you an unsolicited result and lets you quickly ascertain degree!
Utahraptor: So if you scream, they suspect bad-times peritonitis.
T-Rex: Yep! And then they'll send you for emergency surgery. Did you know that one of peritonitis' causes is your BOWELS becoming PERFORATED so that RAW SEWAGE sloshes around in your belly?

So you hop on your skateboard and get on the track, and within a few moments the speed of the treadmill is exactly matching the speed your board would otherwise be travelling at! You're not moving, but the board FEELS like it's travelling at speed.

Utahraptor: But like, what are they like when they're NOT having sex?

I just now figured out why!
T-Rex: It's RENT MONEY.
T-Rex: The lender is renting out money, just the same as if they'd rented out a helicopter! And just like the familiar helicopter rental, I've got to pay money to rent it - usually proportional to the value of the thing borrowed and for how long I've got it.
T-Rex: Also, eventually, I've PROBABLY got to return the helicopter.
Utahraptor: That's what interest is, T-Rex! It's rent.
T-Rex: I always thought it was something special!
T-Rex: But the only difference between interest and rent is that interest is paid in the same medium as the thing borrowed, which, in a single word, is KINDACRAZY. It's like renting a helicopter, and then, paying rent in tiny pieces of helicopter!

T-Rex: And it would be TOTALLY RAD if this record was all really exceptional people. Like if I lived millions of years ago, only I was a mutant with a fully-formed extra hand growing out of the base of my spine! If I was the only specimen from the time, we might conclude that EVERYONE had butt hands then, and that would be provably hilarious. Then I thought: maybe we're already doing this!
Utahraptor: How do you figure?
T-Rex: Well, maybe we're doing the opposite!
T-Rex: Maybe millions of years ago life was awesome and surreal, but only the boring specimens got preserved. Maybe the non-chumps knew to avoid river beds and tar pits! Maybe dragons don't fossilize.

T-Rex: Today is the day I realize saying something ""rocks"" is actually really weird!
T-Rex: It's like a switch went off in my head. This radio station was all bragging on itself, saying ""Kewl 105: WE ROCK!"" and my first thought was, ""Like a moored boat? Is it cool now to sway back and forth, like a boat tied to a dock by a length of rope?""
Dromiceiomimus: You're taking it literally?
T-Rex: That's the thing! My FIRST INSTINCT was to take it literally. I had to remind myself what they really meant.
T-Rex: Then I thought of ""rock concerts"" and it seemed silly! But ""punk rock"" seemed ADORABLE.
Utahraptor: You just need to ROCK MORE!

T-Rex: Looks like this Thursday morning just got filled up!!
T-Rex: Ahem. Plagiarism is the act of plagiarizing; taking someone's words or ideas as if they were your own! That's from the dictionary, Dromiceiomimus. I plagiarized it!
Dromiceiomimus: At what point does plagiarism begin, though? When defining a word, especially in brief, it's possible you'd hit on the exact same word structure as someone else. That's not plagiarism, that's just - independent invention!
Utahraptor: Yeah, and if you say ""I'm hungry"", you're not plagiarizing everyone who's said it before!
T-Rex: FINE.
T-Rex: ""How do I love plagiarism? Let me count the ways.""
Utahraptor: Well, there you're using a poem so famous I'd argue it doesn't need citation. It's a reference! People will get it.

For you see...
T-Rex: I've discovered how to turn most any song into a love song!
T-Rex: As long as the song mentions ""life"", you can replace it with the word ""wife"" and HEY PRESTO: a love song! About wives!
Dromiceiomimus: A love song featuring heterosexual relationships only?
T-Rex: Nuh-uh! If someone sings to the people of the world to spice up their wife, WHICH HAS HAPPENED, I WAS THERE, then it's not totally heterosexual any more!
Utahraptor: I feel like the ""baby"" to ""matey"" sea shanty conversion is more compelling!
T-Rex: I ask you to withhold judgment!
T-Rex: Consider ""It's My Wife"", ""Wife After Death"" (sometimes these songs get sad), ""This Is The Wife"" (a spouse may need pointing out), ""Bring Me To Wife"" (even GRAMMAR ITSELF cannot hold in the face of such raw emotion/transport demands), and ""The Circle Of Wife"".

977,THE FACT THAT YOU COULD EASILY IDENTIFY THE INGREDIENTS OF MY SANDWICH NOW ONLY SERVES TO MAKE ME MORE DEPRESSED,,"T-Rex: Depressive realism is the theory that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world than the non depressed. It started when psychologists experimented with some regular chicks and dudes AND some depressed chicks and dudes.
T-Rex: That's how these things always start!!
T-Rex: Anyway, they put them in a room with a button and a lightbulb. The light turned on and off regardless of when the button was pressed, and the participants who were depressed were more likely to conclude that they weren't in control of the light! The non-depressed people DELUDED THEMSELVES into thinking they had more influence. The popular conclusion was that depressed people saw things more realistically!
Utahraptor: That's a pretty strong conclusion!
T-Rex: Sure is!
T-Rex: And it turns out that the effect only shows up in specific trivial situations! But it's a popular idea. I think some people just like the idea that depression might be an advantage!
Utahraptor: ESPECIALLY depressed people.

T-Rex: And there's this passer-by who is, um, passing by, and he happens to see it. He rushes over to the crumpled car and says ""Oh my God, are you okay??"" and the guy says ""Well, I get by!""
Dromiceiomimus: ... I don't get it.
T-Rex: The driver misunderstands the question; he thinks it's about whether or not he makes enough money to ""get by"" in today's difficult world!
Utahraptor: But nobody says ""Oh my God, are you okay??"" to mean ""Oh my God, do you have a sufficient salary??""
T-Rex: Sure they do!
Utahraptor: No they don't! They lock eyes with you and say ""Are you doing alright?"" with a hand on your shoulder or something. Honestly, this joke seems like it could have been funny at some point, but you telephone gamed it in your head and it doesn't make sense anymore.
Narrator: EARLIER:

T-Rex: We make New Year's Resolutions for a reason!
T-Rex: So we've got a self-modifying system: we examine our personality, determine things we don't like, and try to make them better. But how do we decide what we don't like? Our personality must feed into that process too! So you've got this feedback loop that goes all the way back to when we were born and started making decisions. And it seems to me that if you changed just a tiny thing early on, you could get a completely different adult down the road!
Utahraptor: Sensitive dependence on initial conditions! It's chaos theory applied to personalities, right?
T-Rex: Right!
Utahraptor: [small] Okay, some issues off just the top of my head: you haven't proven your assumption of control (conscious or otherwise) over personality, you seem to assume that babies are born as a blank slate with no initial personality, you leave the idea of ""personality"" pretty ill defined for something so central to your argument, and you haven't shown that altering behaviour (viz., Resolutions) is the same as altering personality.

T-Rex: Let's consider!
T-Rex: Adults can eat whatever foods they want, but also have to pay income taxes and manage personal finances, which is Boring and Stupid!
Dromiceiomimus: Adults can buy their own clothes, but also have to reconcile themselves to the fact that sooner or later, their best years will be behind them!
T-Rex: Adults can own grocery stores, but also have to face the long slow decline of their body, mind and self!
Utahraptor: Adults can see R-rated movies, but also have responsibility for their own well-being!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: Adults can pilot helicopters, but also can marry poorly!
Utahraptor: Adults can sex each other up, but also can put so much meaning and pour so much hope into a single dream that, when this dream is finally achieved, it can never possibly live up to its expectations!
T-Rex: Utahraptor!

It was so crazy that I immediately hopped out of bed and stood upright in my featureless white bedroom!,,"T-Rex: Lucid dreams are dreams where you know you're dreaming! They can be dreams in which you have more control, where you can sometimes even consciously decide what happens next!
T-Rex: They sound like MAYBE the most entertaining dreams ever?
T-Rex: And this is why I have abandoned my research into holodecks and am going to spend all my time working on lucid dreaming instead.
Dromiceiomimus: You were working on holodecks?
T-Rex: Well, I drew up a picture where there's an arrow pointing to a room, and then it says 'holodeck' on the arrow, so - yes?
Utahraptor: Research? That is ARTS and/or CRAFTS.
T-Rex: Hello?! Obviously I found a way to combine all three!
Utahraptor: If you're serious about this, T-Rex, then listen very closely: I need you to start checking your watch twice. It's nothing when you're awake, but in dreams, the numbers will usually be wildly different the second time. It only works with digital watches, but it may be the ONLY clue that you're dreaming. Remember, T-Rex! CHECK YOUR WATCH TWI-

T-Rex: I've got CHARACTERS but no spark. They're not falling in love with each other! They're staring at each other across open plains in sunset, but then when they finally meet up they shake hands cordially. THEN, after a lengthy silence, they inquire about the weather. How do people friggin' fall in love!?
Utahraptor: Physical attractiveness is a good start!
T-Rex: I tried that!
T-Rex: I ended up with EROTICA, Utahraptor. And I felt very odd sitting there, writing about two imaginary people THAT I MADE UP having sex with each other.

T-Rex: I respect what they do but I'm sorry lady oral hygiene professionals, I can't brush and floss three times a day plus after every snack, drink, or intense fantasy about food. I have tried and failed! Also I couldn't marry a professional housecleaner because she would soon suspect that I'm obsessed with trying to undermine all that she's striving for with my every discarded sock and unwashed dish!
Utahraptor: I like how you imagine everyone is so attached to their job!
T-Rex: Oh yeah?
Utahraptor: Yeah! It's like you can't imagine a universe where someone could be a dentist but not actually really be all that into teeth, or a cleaner who doesn't despise disorder. Jobs are all done because of joy and intense personal conviction!
T-Rex: That's because I choose the universe I want to live in.

Narrator: (note that if you already have a full grasp on such differences, this comic will probably be of no help to you)
T-Rex: The differences between adults and children are many!
T-Rex: For example: while adults are by definition fully-grown, children are much smaller!
T-Rex: Adults have more life experience than children, who may have very little!
T-Rex: Adults are, legally, fully-recognized people, while children are not! They do not have the same rights.
T-Rex: Yes, there are many differences between adults and children!
Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What is it, Utahraptor?
Utahraptor: I was just babysitting my adult neighbour. But then I realized: wait, you don't babysit adults! You only babysit CHILDREN.
T-Rex: How embarrassing!

T-Rex: Not bad for a Sunday night, Earth dudes!!
T-Rex: The only problem was that the lander had limited fuel to return to orbit -- less than they expected, actually! So the Earth dudes needed to lighten the load.
Dromiceiomimus: And they threw a bunch of stuff overboard!
T-Rex: Exactly! Anything they wouldn't need for the trip back was left on the moon. Cameras! Scoops! SPACE BOOTS. And...
T-Rex and Utahraptor: ...bags of poop!
T-Rex: You knew?
Utahraptor: Yep! There was no sense bringing that back with them, right? And so every night when I look up to the moon, I know that there is some corner of another world that is forever ours. Also, we left bags of poop there.

T-Rex: Hee hee!
Utahraptor: It seems like a really crappy ending to me!
T-Rex: No!
T-Rex: It RECONTEXTUALIZES the book. People will be like, ""I thought this book was transcendental until that last sentence when the talking filing cabinet showed up!""

1054,hey god! whatcho trying to pull??,,"T-Rex: I have other interests beyond sex! For example, I am interested in...
T-Rex: ... the Capgras delusion!
T-Rex: The Capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them - a dear friend, spouse, or family member - has been replaced by an identical-looking duplicate! What seems to happen is that the automatic EMOTIONAL responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening, so when they meet their loved one, they have an intense feeling of something being OFF about them. They don't feel like they normally do!
Utahraptor: And that means they believe they've been replaced by a duplicate?
T-Rex: Some of the time!
T-Rex: Not everyone leaps from that feeling to ""they've been replaced"", but some do, and that's the Capgras delusion! There's variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced, or their shoes, or things like that.
Utahraptor: It's probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you.
T-Rex (punchline): I can imagine! What's neat though is that it's sometimes based on VISUAL recognition, so that affected people will be fine talking to their loved ones on the phone! It makes me glad I don't have any mental illnesses.

Dromiceiomimus: And then your choice determines their gender?
T-Rex: Yep! You press the button for ""MAN"" and he says ""OH NEAT"" and if you press the button for ""WOMAN"" she says ""COOL, I HAVE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT TO BE THE CASE"".
Utahraptor: And what's the gameplay?
T-Rex: ""Amazing""?
T-Rex: Look, you're trying to bog me down in specifics when I'm dreaming big of amazing end sequences that let you DECIDE who you just rescued.
Utahraptor: Okay, but you're not deciding who you rescued, you're just choosing their gender identity.
T-Rex: Not in the new version! In the new version you choose who you rescued and it says ""OKAY, I AM GEORGE CLOONEY. BUT AM I STILL MAN??""

T-Rex: Of course! Also, ""paci"" is in wimpy script letters and ""fist"" is in these big exploding block letters!
T-Rex: That, my friends, is called ""graphic design"".

This is because I've decided what I'm doing with my life: creating SHAKESPEARE VIDEO GAMES.
T-Rex: Could this TRULY be the greatest calling ever?
T-Rex: And I already have tons of ideas, like ""Richard the Third the Game""! In the introductory cinematic you trade your kingdom for a horse, and then you spend the rest of the game riding around your old kingdom on a horse.
Dromiceiomimus: So it's a platformer?
T-Rex: With stealth elements! Your horse isn't very good and so sometimes you're embarrassed about your horse, and then you have to sneak around.
Utahraptor: You really think people want to ride around on a platforming horse as Richard the Third?
T-Rex: I know I do!
Utahraptor: So, what, the ice level is called ""Winter of Discontent""?
T-Rex: No, that's dumb. The ice level is called ""Oh no! King Richard The Third Has Chilly Pants.""

627,"this linguistic theory is actually called the sapir-whorf hypothesis, not the t-rex/utahraptor hypothesis.  i KNOW.  i am working on it.",,"T-Rex: Does language alter the way we think? Sources say: perhaps!
T-Rex: This source says: DEFINITELY YES.
T-Rex: I think it's a subtle but pervasive effect! If a language doesn't have a word for something, I think I'm less likely to think about whatever it is that word would refer to. For instance, in English we have words for ""friends"", but what if we had a single word for the phrase ""friends who deserve pie more often""? I bet I'd consider buying people more pies!
Utahraptor: You're saying that if we had words for these things, people would think of them more often?
T-Rex: Yeah!
Utahraptor: Well, I agree, but I think you're confusing cause and effect! As things become more prominent, they move to become words. Like ""electronic mail"" becoming ""e-mail"" and finally ""email"" - that was due to email becoming more popular, not because people were creating the word in order to MAKE it more popular. You know?

But it's just language! Look at statistical usage of the word ""heap"", decide using that average, end of story.

T-Rex: Because I've realized: it takes time for my eyes to react to light, too!
T-Rex: And it takes time for the electrical impulses of THAT reaction to travel to my brain, and it takes more time for my brain to react to THOSE. Basically, the idea of an externally consistent personal ""now"" is ridiculous and impossible, and I was a fool to try!

Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator: FORESHADOWING
T-Rex: Foreshadowing's great, because sometimes people want to know what happens in a story before it actually happens. In situations like this, an author might write ""Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space. Or WAS she?? You'd better keep reading, huh?"" There, foreshadowing both hinted at the future of the story, AND encouraged the reader to keep reading. This is an extremely canonical use of foreshadowing.
Utahraptor: So doubt's important to foreshadowing?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
T-Rex: If you simply say ""Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space! Seconds later, she blasted into space!"" that is not foreshadowing. That is just outstanding space storytelling.

T-Rex: So let's say everyone else chose 100 - you'd want to choose 66.67, because that's 2/3rds of 100. But the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don't tell the other players.
Dromiceiomimus: So, 66.67 is really the ceiling - any number larger than that can't possibly win!
T-Rex: Exactly!
Utahraptor: But I can assume all the other players know this too, and won't guess higher than 66.67.

Dromiceiomimus: That's not pathetic fallacy! It's when you give emotions to the inanimate: ""ice wants to float"", and so on. It can also happen when weather mirrors a character's emotions, like when Shakespeare gets sad, and it starts to rain. I think that's what you meant?
T-Rex: OR, when Shakespeare gets pissed, and then a bear shows up and eats whoever pissed him off!! Hah, looks like YOU pissed off the wrong playwright, dude! He's in with the BEARS!!
Utahraptor: The phrase comes about because of the ""pathos"" meaning of ""pathetic""!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: And ""fallacy"" is there because in real life it doesn't actually rain when I get sad.

T-Rex: Obviously if these were his only traits, he'd be filed under Case #4739 with the others!
T-Rex: But he's distinguished by his strange nose, which emits radiation through an unknown but presumed organic process. A fraction of this radiation exists at the low end of the visible spectrum, and as such, his ""red nose"" has been used by Case #1023 as a guide - always on foggy Christmas Eves.
Dromiceiomimus: And yet, as all motorists know, using a bright light in fog actually reduces visibility. What's going on here?
Utahraptor: The answer is simple: this light exists outside public radiological models.
T-Rex: Please, Dr. Utahraptor, proceed!
Utahraptor: Long-range readings suggest this light somehow destroys H2O molecules on contact, absorbing nucleonic energy as fuel for further charged-photonic output. As we're each over 50% water, any direct exposure to ""Rudolph"" is to be avoided.
T-Rex: His utility in fog now becomes evident. There's just one more thing!

T-Rex: Oh snap! It's the emission theory of vision, bitches!

T-Rex: Ah, that's because our eye beams need sunlight to work properly. And before you say ""How come we can glance quickly at stars and see them even though they're super far away"", THAT'S because our eye beams move infinitely fast, OBVIOUSLY.

""...Did someone say BEEF??""",,"T-Rex: It is common to imagine your life as a story, with yourself as the main character! It's a story with no real climax that always ends with you totally dead.
T-Rex: However!
T-Rex: My issue is that STUFF happens to main characters: dramatic stuff! Stuff that's not always good. It would be fun to be a bit character, a guy who gets one or two lines and whose personality is encapsulated in a few words: 'likes boats', 'old and wise', or 'eats a lot and, therefore, can't control himself around food. When someone says ""Where's the beef?"" he runs up and says, ""Did someone say BEEF?"" because that is definitely how people who like food act.'

T-Rex: Historiography is the history of history, and includes the study of how history is understood!
T-Rex: We tend to think that history is just a record of what goes on in the past, but this overlooks the fact that two different people can view the same event, and even the same series of events, differently.
T-Rex: For instance! Is history the story of progress, from savage to cultured Man? Is it rather the study of Great Men and their Characters? Perhaps it is the story of cultural challenge and response!
Utahraptor: What's with the sexist language, T-Rex? You're all, ""great MEN, cultured MEN""!
T-Rex: Sorry!
T-Rex: Most of these theories of history are over 50 years old, and reflect the sexism in the language at the time.

T-Rex: Unfortunately, there are ""no"" exceptions!
Utahraptor: Has there been any research into this?

1206,guys! i'm beginning to think that the very concept of Australian Batman is flawed!,,"T-Rex: BEFORE we had dictionaries, words could be spelt in a variety of different ways. Now that we have dictionaries, spellings are fixed.
T-Rex: This I accept!
T-Rex: It speeds up reading AND comprehension, and spelling errors give editors ""easy points"" when looking for something to edit. FINE. But we've lost the ability to encode the way words are spoken: the pronunciation and accents of a speaker! We can get a little of that back through capitalization and creative! punctuation! but still - it's hard in text to tell an Australian from an American, assuming they're both speaking English.
T-Rex: The result of this is a proliferation of stereotypes!
Utahraptor: How so?
T-Rex (punchline): Well, say I'm writing a story about Australian Batman and I want to show people that Batman's Australian now. Spelling means I can't rely on his accent, so I'm forced to have him call people ""mate"" and grimly refer to ""shrimps"" placed upon ""barbies"". It's the only way!
Utahraptor: Um - pretty sure there are others!

T-Rex: One day an alive woman died. OR DID SHE? Because now she's... A ZOMBIE!!
T-Rex: Can I get a what what?
T-Rex: Our zombie woman is Patient Zero of the zombie outbreak, which suggests to the attentive reader that we're using an infection model of zombification. Let R0 be the threshold quantity of infections. If R0 is less than one, then the infection will die out. If it's equal to one, then the disease will remain endemic in the population. And the more above one R0 is, the greater the epidemic!
T-Rex: So to quantify our zombie terror, all we need to do is calculate R0!
Utahraptor: Can I hear about the people she bites?
T-Rex: Assuming N population and a contact rate of β, then our zombie will make βN bites per time unit, resulting in infections with a mean infectious period of 1/γ: γ being of course the mean recovery rate. Therefore, R0 = (βN)/γ!
Utahraptor: Does she bite anyone she knew from before? Like, her kids maybe?
T-Rex (punchline): These metrics are simplified, as natural immunity is not factored into N. Different compartmental epidemic models may provide different results!

I remember holding back my punches a bit because I didn't want to be known as the kind of dude who would punch out a turkey.
Narrator: LATER: RUMOURS SPREAD.
Utahraptor: Hey! You punch out turkeys?
T-Rex: No!
T-Rex: That was in a dream. A DREAM. I never actually punched out a turkey.
Utahraptor: I heard that parents should lock up their turkeys, because you'll punch them out!
T-Rex: No!! I promise to never punch out a turkey.

Narrator: WHEN TO USE ""COWABUNGA"": ONLY IF YOU ARE A NINJA TURTLE.
T-Rex: So Kant's Categorical Imperative is more of a meta-directive, right?

I just haven't explored it! It's probably one of my many

T-Rex: I'm probably ALSO really good at surfing, stand up comedy, cross-stitching and helicopter theft! I just haven't tried them because I prefer believing that I have secret talents the world hasn't seen to knowing for certain that I don't actually have anything special and secret in me waiting to be accessed.
Utahraptor: You prefer hidden talent to palpable failure!
T-Rex: Precisely!
Utahraptor: Well, why not just reframe them so they're talents that you HAD, but missed out on? Like, you could have been a great soccer player if only you'd practiced when you were a kid. So the talent's still there, it's simply your flabby aged and relatively enfeebled body that's no longer suitable!
Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX HAS BEEN STEALING HELICOPTERS SINCE HE WAS EIGHT:

T-Rex: Second ONLY to the ""I'm so angry my head is now a steamwhistle, toot toot"" motif.
T-Rex: If I had three wishes - and the wishes had to be about cartoon stereotypes being real, I guess - then those are the two I'd choose. The third one would be ""no falling when running off cliffs unless you look down and notice you're running on air"", because that, my friends, would be HANDY.
T-Rex: Free bridges for the strong-willed!
Utahraptor: I would have thought you'd choose the bullet hole / water one!
T-Rex: Which one's that?
Utahraptor: It's the one where you're shot with a machine gun, and then later you're thirsty, and then you drink water, and then the water springs out of the holes in your body.
T-Rex (punchline): Hilarious!! Plus, it offers some resistance to machine gun fire.

Those birds that flew into your window still haunt you, trying to peck out your eyes with beaks that, LUCKILY FOR YOU, now pass through physical matter. And that's not even considering our dead cave-ancestors: agitated, frustrated, and confused!
Utahraptor: You sure know how to make me uncomfortable in my own skin!
T-Rex: The same skin these ghosts now crave!
T-Rex: And you're lucky ghosts haven't yet figured out how to become real, because if and when they do every living thing will instantly collapse into a puffy pile of red gore as literally trillions of dead but still pissed off animal life pile on top of us.
Utahraptor: Then what happens?
T-Rex: Um, all is quiet on a dead planet and we wait for life to evolve again? IN CONCLUSION, I rate this world-ending threat above ""asteroid impact"" but below ""the dreamer finally awakens and says 'whoah what a crazy yet massively detailed dream'"".

T-Rex: Why do we say ""rest in peace""? Is it just -
Utahraptor: It comes from Latin!
Utahraptor: It's a prayer, ""requiescat in pace"", which also works in English with about the same meaning: rest in peace. It comes from the Christian tradition, which at various points and to various people has held that there is a time of ""soul sleep"" after death but before judgment.

T-Rex: Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us.
T-Rex: But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject.
Utahraptor: No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like produces like is his fundamental belief.
Utahraptor: Doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone.
T-Rex: When a deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on
T-Rex (punchline): both; but when amongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once amongst several million individuals--and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to a-

Please! You know why our ancestors crawled out of the ocean?
T-Rex: I'm pretty sure it was to avoid these talks!!
T-Rex: With that in mind, I now present more ""euphemisms"" to allow you to get by in society!
T-Rex: For example, instead of saying ""I feel afraid"", you can say ""Aw crap! I think I've discovered a weakness in myself."" And instead of ""I love you!"", just say ""I have found another weakness; please, excuse me.""
Utahraptor: Love isn't a weakness, T-Rex. It's a strength!
T-Rex: Please avoid such crass language, Utahraptor!
T-Rex: Instead of that, you COULD'VE said, ""Love isn't a w- hey, where are the warp whistles in Mario 3?"" and I would have replied ""There's three! The first is found in the third level: crouch on the last white block until you fall through, and then run to the end.""

T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: the other day I saw some kids who had dropped their bag of marbles. It was a stereotypical image of childhood! But when I stopped to help them pick them up, they said, ""No, don't touch them please.""
T-Rex: Ouch, man! What went wrong? Can we no longer trust a stranger's helping hand?
Utahraptor: Sure we can, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, these kids couldn't!
T-Rex: My mood was off for the rest of the day because of it. I was worrying about communities and stuff!

Tomatoes and potatoes are but two of the best-rhyming examples. When people back home discovered these vegetables, they started experimenting with them and coming up with all sorts of crazy, YET DELICIOUS, dishes! The Columbian explosion was an explosion of TASTE.

T-Rex: For most of his life he documented the disappearing ""great race"" of the Indian!
T-Rex: He took over 40 thousand photographs - not bad for one guy! And in many cases, his records are the only recorded history we've got. But what's amazing about Curtis is that he specifically set out to record the doomed people his culture imagined Indians to be: the noble savage, the Indian that was alien, stoic, exotic and dying.
T-Rex: And when he met Indians that DIDN'T meet his expectations, he just changed them for his photographs!
Utahraptor: How?
T-Rex: Man, he carried boxes of ""Indian"" clothing and wigs with him: ethnic signifiers for his subjects if they didn't look Indian enough! And his Indian was clean-shaven, so he'd pay men to shave.
Utahraptor: It's an interesting conflict in the guy: record the Indian before they ""die out"", but already know what you want to see.

Dromiceiomimus: Is the whole nature/nurture debate really about assigning blame?
T-Rex: I think so! It doesn't change the ""nature"" (oh ho ho!) of what's being discussed, just its origin.
Utahraptor: Well, it's not just about blame or credit, T-Rex, it's also about free will!
T-Rex: Free will?
Utahraptor: Yeah, because if something important about you is fully determined by your genes, then you never had any control over that, and you're not responsible. You didn't have a choice. On the other hand, if you think babies are born as blank slates, then that's limitless personal freedom, but that has problems too!

T-Rex and off panel: ...but to attribute that thinking to yourself just because you're aware of it is an awful big leap for a skeptic to make!

God: YOU WANT TO WRITE THE LITTLE PRINCE
T-Rex: BASICALLY.
T-Rex: Except that's been done! I want something NEW that will touch the heart of everyone, WITHOUT EXCEPTION.
Dromiceiomimus: This is the desire authors have, isn't it? To say something new that is nevertheless eternal? To really touch people, to change their lives for the better using only their ideas?
T-Rex: I guess! I bet some authors just want to tell jokes about dinosaurs though.
T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: That wouldn't be so bad
Utahraptor: So - get to work! Get to writing!
T-Rex: I can't! I need INSPIRATION.
Utahraptor: Okay, here: take something that's common to everyone, and present it in an empathic, sympathetic light. How about - letting down someone you love! We've all done it and I don't think anyone enjoys it. There's pathos there.
T-Rex: Brilliant! You've really helped me out, Utahraptor!

T-Rex: How many emotions are there?? I can think of at least three.
T-Rex: Desire, elation, and rage!
God: YOUR LIST OF EMOTIONS IS A SHORT STORY HUH
T-Rex: Yep! It's about a woman who desires something, then gets it and is pretty elated about the whole thing, but then, AFTERWARDS, she's pretty pissed.
God: COOL
Utahraptor: I think emotions are not discrete but rather a continuum, T-Rex!
T-Rex: I find your views interesting! Tell me more!
Utahraptor: The emotions we have in English are just labels we've applied to a SPECTRUM of feeling. You can almost always divide existing emotions into smaller, more precise chunks! For example, your well-known satisfaction at eating cereal in the morning is an exact, identifiable, reproducible joy that I can only label ""breakfast pleasure"".
T-Rex: Breakfast pleasure! Finally, I have words for that most sublime of satisfactions!! BREAKFAST PLEASURE. I love breakfast pleasure.

T-Rex: Then, that night, they had SEXUAL CONGRESS!
T-Rex: Coincidence?
Utahraptor: Or just one more way sexual intimacy is commodified?
T-Rex: Sex for clean dishes! Exactly!
Utahraptor: I was more pointing out that you're the guy who's drawing the equal sign between doing the dishes and having sex. They could be unrelated!
T-Rex: And I'M just pointing out now we can tease her by offering to do her dishes and raising our eyebrows! I'm gonna do it like this:

T-Rex: Turns out he's got competition!
T-Rex: FROM SNOW WHITE'S WICKED QUEEN.
T-Rex: The story glosses over it kinda quickly, like they KNOW it's nuts, but this lady - this QUEEN - has a magic mirror which, due to its magical ways, will HONESTLY ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU PUT TO IT AS LONG AS IT RHYMES. And what does she use it for?
Dromiceiomimus: Prettiness tests!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: She doesn't say ""Mirror mirror on the wall, how can life's curse of aging be stalled?""
Utahraptor: Nope!
Utahraptor: Nor does she say ""Mirror mirror on the wall, how can clean energy be provided for all?"" or even ""Mirror mirror mounted here, how can chicks and dudes have satisfying careers?""

T-Rex: Are we going to one day discover the sort of pants the second mate was wearing? The exact key the final song was played in? The ship won't survive on the sea bed forever: eventually it will collapse into a pile of metal and ceramic and decay even further. We may soon reach a point where we have learnt all that it is possible to learn about the Titanic!
Utahraptor: I disagree, my friend!
T-Rex: And I am relieved to hear it!
Utahraptor: We'll always have alternative, CRAZY theories to entertain us: maybe the Titanic sank for the insurance money! Maybe it never sank at all! And in the future, where time travel exists, we'll be able to send observers on board to watch the sinking!
T-Rex: Oh man! Maybe - maybe EVERYONE on board was an observer!
T-Rex: And then more time travellers came back to try to stop them but they keep drowning too, and now the first thing you learn in temporalnaut school is ""stay the heck away from Olympic-class ships, bro!""

Dromiceiomimus: And what if ""Johnny B. Goode"" was played as the next song?
T-Rex: THAT would be entirely awesome!
Utahraptor: Hah! You don't want to get married. You want to go to a dance played by Marty McFly!
T-Rex: Man, whatever!
T-Rex: I've been to like two weddings in my life, but I've seen them portrayed in media thousands of times! Is it SO WRONG to incorporate elements of these media portrayals into my own expectations??
Utahraptor: I guess not, except for the fact that the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance is a HIGH SCHOOL BALL and not a wedding!
T-Rex: Hello?? Marty's parents share a relationship-making kiss at that dance! The parallels are TOTALLY OBVIOUS.
T-Rex (punchline): I'll say it again: if I had one wish, it'd be ""Tell me how long it's going to take until everyone realizes they should never argue with me about Back to the Future"".

1214,the radio's turned down. it's not because i couldn't get the lyrics to fit otherwise.,,"T-Rex: I like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own product centric lyrics. It's a window into an alternate corporate-controlled universe!
T-Rex: An alternate corporate controlled universe where all songwriters have brain damage?
T-Rex: The lyrics are always so terrible and the songs entirely arbitrary. It's like - it's like they license ""Candle in the Wind"" and then have some Elton John sound-alike singing ""Goodbye, Norma Jeane / Did you ever / Use Duracell / They make some fine batteries / On this we all should dwell""
Dromiceiomimus: Hah! You know, I'd watch that commercial.

Utahraptor: Do you know who really did invent the fire extinguisher though, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: But, you know, that's his fault, right? He didn't CAPITALIZE on it. But I would have! I'd have the extinguishers say ""Remember T-Rex? He was so great, wasn't he guys?"" every time they were used. Just a soft reminder - nothing too loud!
Utahraptor: Huh.

T-Rex: I try, but it's everywhere! Even not on Star Trek!

959,"bard of avon's just standing there in his pajamas, flipping off the toaster",,"T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally can't talk walking around and behaving like people! It happens whenever a toaster flips you off.
Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS
Narrator: today's technique:
Narrator: ANTHROPOMORPHISM
T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is often used in childrens' stories where you have talking animals, but can also be used in more adult works! This is because occasionally adults enjoy it when a cat is sassy. Sometimes, a character will be anthropomorphized by mistake, like when you write a play and accidentally attribute dialogue to ceiling tile. The ceiling tile is said to be ""anthropomorphized"" if the oversight is not corrected in a timely fashion.
Utahraptor: We all know what anthropomorphism is, dude!
T-Rex: Aw man, really?
Utahraptor: Yep! We've actually talked about it before, remember? But - you know, thanks for the reminder!

Narrator: SOON:
Utahraptor: So, how's the experiment going?
T-Rex: TOTALLY SUCKY!
T-Rex: I can't figure out what I should be testing. What are some instincts people have?
Utahraptor: Oh, well, you could always put your favourite food in your mouth and try not to chew or swallow it. It's possible to do this, but the desire to eat it is strong. Tada! Instinct!
T-Rex: Ooh! OR, I could surround myself with attractive and sexually-available women and then try not to have the intercourse with them!

Utahraptor: You want the future to rebuild you based on your stuff?
T-Rex: Not stuff! HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS.
T-Rex: All of which point to a particular person. I mean, I'd then like them to invent time travel and send Future Regenerated Me back in time to me so that we can pal around, but one step at a time, you know? I can wait!

T-Rex: I'd never want to eat polluted excited pork meat, Dromiceiomimus. I just invented it and I never want to eat it.
Dromiceiomimus: Okay!
T-Rex: Just think about it! ""Polluted""? Eww!! And what does ""excited"" mean when applied to meat? It just raises too many questions.
T-Rex: I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.

Utahraptor: What's it like being awake for over a day?
T-Rex: Last night I ate lots of pears by mistake.

T-Rex: What if I'm a new form of dinosaur that can get tired but that doesn't actually require rest? I'd never know until I did something like this!
Utahraptor: I think you're exhausted and can't recognize it.

514,I LOVE YOU ROAST BEEF,,"T-Rex: I've been thinking about gender roles! Is gender a social construct?
T-Rex: Or, does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits?
Dromiceiomimus: Well T-Rex, it can't be a purely biological construct, because there are people born intersexed!
T-Rex: That is true! Plus, ideas of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" change over time and across cultures. I don't think a purely social OR biological explanation satisfies!
Utahraptor: It's a very tricky question, and one that many people feel strongly about!
T-Rex: Indeed!
Utahraptor: Besides, even if we do assume gender is some mixture of both society and biological self, all that gets us is a murky combination of influences, predisposition and societal feedback that may be impossible to untangle.
T-Rex: Hey, let's try though!

Dromiceiomimus: Haven't they done that before?
T-Rex: His best friend is Clark Ent! They haven't done THAT before. ""Clark Ent.""
Utahraptor: So what's your story? You need a story beyond your premise.
T-Rex: Not when the premise is this good, baby!
T-Rex: Okay, fine - THE STORY is that Bruce doesn't know he's Batman but then one day he reads a Batman comic that flutters down from the sky and realizes that he should be the Batman of our universe.
Utahraptor: And then he gets shot by a random criminal!
T-Rex: WHAT? NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO BATMAN.

1576,"after finishing this comic, i found out that mumler actually destroyed all of his negatives shortly before his death, perhaps in a bid to prevent future generations from still having his photos around and, with our modern eyes and greater familiarity with photography, seeing them as the ridiculous, transparent fraud they were!  MUMLER TRIED TO PREVENT THIS VERY COMIC FROM HAPPENING, YOU GUYS.  THERE IS A CHEEZED OFF GHOST OF MUMLER IN THE ROOM WITH ME RIGHT NOW, AND HE'S - HE'S TOTALLY CHEEZED I BET",,"Narrator: HISTORY'S CHUMPS
T-Rex: History is full of chumps, you guys!!
T-Rex: Today's historical chump is William H. Mumler (born 1832), who was a photographer guy who did portraits! Only he wasn't a very good photographer guy because one time he accidentally double-exposed some film, and the resulting image showed one portrait clearly, but also showed a ghostly image of the other portrait!
Utahraptor: So he threw it away and reminded himself to not make that dumb mistake anymore?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: Instead he embarked on a career as a SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHER and made a lot of money duping a lot of people, including Abraham Lincoln's widow. Only, people eventually started to notice that his ""ghosts"" looked an awful lot like living people around town!
Utahraptor: Hah! Whoops!
T-Rex: They ALSO eventually noticed how he was breaking into their houses so he could look at photographs and figure out what his ghosts were supposed to look like.
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway like everyone else from history he eventually died and now his entire life has been compressed to a short story, the end!

Soon! Soonish, anyway. Hallowe'en is coming up in several months. I'm probably going as a pretty pretty princess. Anyway.
T-Rex: I'm writing a Hallowe'en story! A spooky story called ""The Haunted Nun Who DIES!""
Dromiceiomimus: She lives in a haunted house, and then she dies?
T-Rex: No no, the ghost haunts her. Like a house? And then she dies and the ghost dies too so it's like, Russian nesting doll ghosts. This happens several times over the course of the narrative, so by the end, there's so many ghosts-within-ghosts that the only possible response is ULTIMATE TERROR.
Utahraptor: I'm not terrified!
T-Rex: Perhaps not yet!
T-Rex: But you're not realizing what I've unlocked here! I'm the first ever to realize that if one ghost is scary, then nested ghosts increase fright LINEARLY while maintaining a fixed surface area! It is the most terror possible per cubic foot!
Utahraptor: I GUESS that's true.
Narrator: THE BOOK'S A HIT! BUT... WHAT TO DO FOR A SEQUEL??
T-Rex: Easy! I've made all the ghosts ghosts of ZOMBIES and WEREWOLVES and VAMPYRES and MUMMIES, and then they all haunt the body of Frankenstein!

T-Rex: Attention, world! YOU WIN!
T-Rex: After years correcting people, I am finally conceding this ground. While it is ENTIRELY FACTUAL that Mary Shelley never gave the monster a name as part of a grand symbol for the poor creature's lack of identity, I guess that was pretty much her bad. She should've called him ""Stitchy Fleshface"" or ""Bubba Unhugga"" because it turns out we're ENTIRELY UNWILLING to have reanimated flesh walking around without sticking a name on it first.
Utahraptor: Well, it is kind of a dickish thing to correct people on!
T-Rex: It's not!
T-Rex: Any REASONABLE person would relish the correction and-
Utahraptor: Any REASONABLE person would recognize ""Frankenstein"" could easily be shorthand for ""the Frankenstein creature"", just as ""Toyota"" stands for ""the Toyota Motor Corporation"".

2240,"YES I KNOW one twin is not always evil, but here's another way to look at this: both twins are not ALWAYS good",,"T-Rex: Isn't it interesting how ""maroon"" can mean both ""left alone"" and refer to a dark purpley colour?
T-Rex: THE CORRECT ANSWER HERE IS ""YES"", OKAY??
T-Rex: The colour sense comes from the French ""marron"", or ""chestnut"", whose colour it is supposed to reflect! And the castaway version comes from Spanish ""cimarrón"", meaning something that is wild or untamed! It's just CRAZY COINCIDENCE that these two separate words ended up being the same in English. We stole the French word and the Spanish word and then smushed 'em together and made them kiss and now they're the same word!!
Utahraptor: Well, they're not REALLY the same word, right?
T-Rex: Sure they are!

T-Rex: Poems likely predate the written word!
T-Rex: It makes sense when you think about it. Before writing, the only way to keep track of something is to memorize it! And if you're memorizing something in POEM form, then you can automatically incorporate structure to the language: say, rhyming couplets. And that structure gives you something to jog your memory if you forget! The result is that structured narrative poetry can be much easier to remember than just free verse.
Utahraptor: So poems could be among the earliest, most practical forms of communication!
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: And this is why I feel bad! I didn't know that I was making fun of one of the Elder Gods of language! I thought I was making fun of ""The smelly dog who pooed / Has spied me in the nude"".

1761,feelings CAN be fun,,"T-Rex: If the Titanic had hit the iceberg head-on, damage would have been limited to the comparatively strong bow of the ship, and only a few compartments would have flooded. Some would've been hurt and maybe even killed -
T-Rex: - but the ship would not have sunk!
Dromiceiomimus: Alternatively, Titanic's rudder was mounted behind her middle propeller, which was on a turbine not designed to work in reverse. When the iceberg was spotted and the first officer ordered both the hard-to-port turn and full reverse, this middle propeller simply stopped, greatly hampering the effectiveness of the rudder. Ordering the turn at speed would likely have saved the ship.
T-Rex: An excellent point, Dromiceiomimus!
Utahraptor: The ship could also have been saved with a bomb threat, delaying its maiden voyage!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: If I'd been there I could've altered orders, I could've modified the ship's route, I could've done one of a hundred thousand things to save the ship and all 1517 aboard her who perished.

They inform the language we use when talking about all sorts of concepts, and are almost subconscious.
T-Rex: For example: ""LIFE IS A JOURNEY""!
T-Rex: People use this metaphor all the time, all talkin' about ""going places in life"", ""getting a head start in life"", ""being at a crossroads"", and so on. It's so entrenched that to talk about life using another metaphor seems odd! For example, saying ""I've saved $3.55 in life"" sounds weird, but only because I'm using the much less popular ""LIFE IS A DISCOUNT STORE WITH SALES THAT CAN OCCASIONALLY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF"" metaphor.
Utahraptor: Are there other metaphors like this?
T-Rex: Oh, tons!
T-Rex: ""Burning with desire"" and ""warming up to someone""? That's ""AFFECTION IS HEAT"". ""Falling behind"" at work before ""catching up""? ""SCHEDULES ARE MOVING OBJECTS"". ""You're in my way"", ""Get out of my way"", and, ARGUABLY, ""I've lost my way""? That's the classic ""DIRECTION IS A BUCKET THAT PEOPLE KEEP SNEAKING INTO"".

Utahraptor: Suppose I'd like to observe such an experiment but cannot afford a ticket?
T-Rex: Not a problem!
T-Rex: Demand is high, so scientists have taken the extraordinary step of broadcasting their process live on TV. You can go to bars and watch the experiment unfold with other fans who are rooting for the same hypothesis you are, cheering as the results come in!
Utahraptor: Delightful!
T-Rex: The downside is it's hard to control external variables, so the experiments repeat quite often. But that's good for us, because it just means more science!
T-Rex (punchline): Also the scientists get way ripped from all the science they're doing and that can be PRETTY DISTRACTING, y'all.

1672,"this comic originally had dromiceiomimus saying ""What if you look in the mirror and see flaws so fundamental that they can't be changed?  What if you see nothing but a big pile of flaws?"" and then I was like, ""man, I don't know the answer to that!!  looks like it's time for another PANTS-CENTRIC REWRITE""",,"Narrator: SELF IMPROVEMENT
T-Rex: Sometimes you need to look in the mirror and say ""That, my friend, is someone with some friggin' FLAWS.""
T-Rex: It sucks, but you have to do it at least sometimes!
T-Rex: Then the next thing you have to do is improve yourself. For example, if you look in the mirror and say ""Man, that guy's totally underinformed about world events"", then you should follow the news more.
Dromiceiomimus: What are your flaws, T-Rex?
T-Rex: Aha! A trick question! For you see, I ran this exercise JUST THIS MORNING and have thus removed all flaws!
Utahraptor: Okay, what flaws did you remove then?
T-Rex: Two of them, actually!
T-Rex: The first one was that I was TOO HANDSOME, so I just raised my standards some. Now I'm just the right amount of handsome.
Utahraptor: Uh-huh. And the second?
T-Rex (punchline): ""Too Many Pants"".

T-Rex: Finally, things were looking up for dream T-Rex!
T-Rex: This was at noon, dream time, and the plane was to leave at six. I made myself a sandwich, but it must've taken a while, because when I looked at the clock, it was 6:30 already! I'd missed my flight AND party entirely, and my friends all chastised me for being so dumb. ""Why didn't you leave at least two hours for check in with an international flight?"" they said!
Utahraptor: So you dreamed about being cussed out?
T-Rex: Yeah, it was great!
T-Rex: I remember saying ""OBVIOUSLY it was a dumb mistake, guys. It'll never happen again; now I know to always leave plenty of time to get to the airport!""
Utahraptor: And when you woke up you remembered that moral!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: I'm now learning life lessons WHILE I SLEEP, Utahraptor. I'm pretty sure I've moved on to the next stage of existence. I'm pretty sure when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be a being of PURE ENERGY.

T-Rex: I could take some, go out, and CAUSE PROBLEMS!
T-Rex: You could even overdose on lie serum and never tell the truth again, UNTIL you got an injection of truth serum to cancel it out.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think that's how medical science works!
T-Rex: How can you trust a medical science that won't share the amazing secret of LIE SERUM, also known as the ""Serum of Lies"" and more obliquely as the ""Serum of Inducing Distrustfulness In Others""?
Utahraptor: Perhaps it's beautiful that people would invent a truth serum but not a lie serum!
T-Rex: How's that?
Utahraptor: Two ways! It's beautiful that we strive for a way to create truth, but not untruth; the other is a sad beauty in that there's no demand for a lie serum, because our bodies seem to manufacture it themselves.

T-Rex: A happy machine!

T-Rex: No!

Narrator: T-REX AND FRIENDS DISCUSS: TRÜ LÜV
T-Rex: The problem I have is that so many people claim to have found it, but the odds that you'd ever meet that one person AND that they'd be available, willing, and of the right gender and sexual orientation are really pretty small. CONCLUSION: a lot of people must be faking it!
Dromiceiomimus: But ""true love"" doesn't mean that there's only one person you can have it with!
T-Rex: Debatable! People often talk about finding ""the one"".
Utahraptor: I think that you're being too strict about this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How's that?
Utahraptor: You're reading it as if there's one ""true"" person that ""true love"" can refer to, meaning that you've got ONE CHANCE for total happiness in the world, and loving anyone else is just settling for second place or worse! I've always seen it as referring to, say, how a wheel can be true, when it spins perfectly and doesn't wobble.
Narrator: TALKING ABOUT LOVE: NOT THE SAME AS ACTUALLY BEING IN LOVE
T-Rex: Hey, since when do you come up with such nice analogies for true love?
Off panel: It has always been my special power!

Dromiceiomimus: Actually, my friend, I would disagree! I think there are more productive uses of your time.
T-Rex: I'll let history be the judge of that!
Utahraptor: That's a pretty suspect saying, don't you think?
T-Rex: WHAT
Utahraptor: Seriously! It's predicated on history always being a story of progression, with the future assumed to be a better judge of what's right than the present. I'm not sure that's valid! Plus, I'm certain there's things that have been variously judged to be good and bad at different points in history!
T-Rex: Okay, so what if I said ""I think I'll let an assumed future history which agrees with my current position be the judge of THAT!""?

T-Rex: And I assure you it will be... SUPER excellent?
Utahraptor: I bet it will be, assuming you don't make ""super"" puns the whole night long!

"
737,"friends, i have bad news!  the answer is still actually 'no way'!",,"T-Rex: I have written a new story, called ""Make Way, Here Comes Tiny Chef!""
T-Rex: It's about a tiny chef who makes tiny food for everyone!
T-Rex: And though he's tiny in size, his food is always big on taste. Oh! And there's a scene where he cooks a big banquet for everyone, and it's really good, and everyone says thanks to him all at once, and Tiny Chef says, ""Oh, it wasn't any trouble!"" Then he smiles and adds, ""Actually, maybe it was just a... TINY bit of trouble?"" and everybody laughs. Oh, Tiny Chef!
Utahraptor: It sounds like a fun story, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Really! You approve!
Utahraptor: Yep! It's nice to see you writing a nice wholesome children's book for a change.
T-Rex: Whoah, children's book? Mine is a book for adults, Utahraptor. My market is fully-grown men and women who would like to find out just a little bit more about one very tiny chef.
T-Rex: For have we all not woken up in the morning only to ask ourselves ""What is it really like, being a tiny chef in a world of regular-sized chefs? Is there no book to explore this tantalizing question?""
T-Rex (punchline): Friends, I have good news! The answer is no longer 'no'!

T-Rex: Oh well. It doesn't really matter either way, I suppose.
Dromiceiomimus: Are we still on for dinner?
Narrator: THE END
Narrator: PHILOSOPHY COMICS II
Utahraptor: T-Rex! Science tells us everything is relative!
Utahraptor: This means that there is no such thing as truth! Your idea of what is right could be just as good as mine!
T-Rex: You misrepresent the science. All vantage points are relative, however, this does not mean that all THINGS are relative. That would be absurd.
T-Rex (punchline): But please, continue to take simplified scientific results and apply them naively to philosophical thought!

2335,All of the other reindeer aren't laughing now.,,"Narrator: CASE FILE #4523 UPDATE FROSTY THE SNOW MAN
T-Rex: Thank you all for coming: I remind you this meeting is classified. Until yesterday, we believed ""Frosty"" was hiding somewhere in the north. We were wrong.
T-Rex: ""Frosty"" (Case #4523!) has BECOME the north.
T-Rex: All contiguous polar ground snow now either is a part of ""Frosty""'s body or falls under his control: the distinction is no longer relevant. The presence of Agent 95 on the Barneo ice floe appears to have awakened the creature, as snow is extracting itself from the permafrost and collecting near the North Pole. We believe we're witnessing the creation of a new, colossal, Snow Man.
Dromiceiomimus: This is the true cause of the seismic events reported in the media.
Utahraptor: Conventional weapons have had no effect: the snow melts, freezes, and begins to collect itself again.
T-Rex: Indeed!
Utahraptor: Our last hope is a reindeer whose red nasal radiation destroys water molecules and whose linguistic aptitudes mean he can be convinced to work for us. ""Rudolph"" has been released from lead-lined containment and is flying towards the pole now.
T-Rex: By the time he arrives we estimate ""Frosty"" will be visible from space.
T-Rex: Agents: we're sending a single vegetarian prey animal against three continents' worth of angry snow. And if he fails, the ""thumpety thump thump"" of ""Frosty""'s arrival may be the last thing any of us hear.
T-Rex (punchline): Your final letters to your families have been readied for transmission. Dismissed!

526,not too shabby!,,"T-Rex: Isn't it CRAZY how young some people are when they get married?
T-Rex: It's CRAZY!
T-Rex: My parents were only twenty when they got married. Twenty! I was nowhere near marriage material at twenty. I was and still am a loose cannon!
Dromiceiomimus: Maybe they just found the right person?
T-Rex: Twenty, though! You're almost still a teenager at that age! A baby! How do you know enough to get married?
Utahraptor: I think that marriage is a very personal thing, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Well, yeah!
Utahraptor: No, really! It's an expression of love, which is almost by definition inexpressible to someone else. Marrying young probably just seems crazy to you because you didn't meet the right person at that age!
T-Rex: So it's essentially unknowable to me unless I had married at that age myself... Hmmm...
Narrator: ANYWAY, T-REX GOES BACK IN TIME TO WHEN HE WAS 20, FINDS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE, AND MARRIES HER:
T-Rex: Kick ass!

T-Rex: Casey and Riley were alone at last. ""Finally,"" breathed Riley into Casey's ear. ""I've been wanting sex times all day."" They kissed. While kissing, Casey's arms wrapped around Riley, found a very enticing bottom, and gave it a squeeze.
Dromiceiomimus: Whoah! Smooth move, Casey!!
T-Rex: I know! Casey is good at squeezing bums; that's pretty much canon
Utahraptor: Okay, but no way can you describe the sex itself! Different body parts come into play.
T-Rex: NOT A PROBLEM.

735,you can sneak crying pills into people's sandwiches for illegal weepy shenanigans,,"T-Rex: I am a pretty satisfactory dude, and yet sometimes, I feel incomplete. The reason for this is simple:
T-Rex: I've never been moved to tears by music!
T-Rex: We have this cultural image of some prodigy beautifully playing the piano while everyone in the audience weeps. If I were there I could only look around in confusion! I like music, sure, and some of it is very pretty, but to cry about it? I wouldn't know where to start!
T-Rex: With crying pills, I guess?
Utahraptor: Hey, do crying pills really exist?
T-Rex: You know, I have no idea!
T-Rex: Maybe they do, but they're just super spicy pills, so people's eyes well up when they bite into them. Anyway!
Utahraptor: Anyway!
Utahraptor: I've seen you cry at movies.
T-Rex: Man, that was because movies can have sad narratives! Music just has a bunch of notes that I am entirely unable to relate to in any emotional context.
T-Rex (punchline): On account of my untrained ears and my magnificent manly heart?

T-Rex: Today's letter to Professor Science comes from Alexis, who writes:
T-Rex: ""Dear Professor, how much would it cost to buy the WHOLE DANG PLANET??""
T-Rex: Wow! I guess we need to know how much our planet is worth, then. I'm guessing... a kabazillion dollars?
Dromiceiomimus: What if we took the sum value of all the world's currencies? That'd tell us how much everything is worth, in total!
T-Rex: That works, right? Because money itself isn't worth anything, but we all PRETEND it's worth the value of the goods it's traded for, right?
Utahraptor: Except that doesn't include oceans and stuff - things you can't buy!
T-Rex: TRUE.
Utahraptor: Plus, buying the WHOLE DANG PLANET also means buying everything on it, and that means we now have to put a price on LIFE ITSELF.
T-Rex: I always knew this day would come, Utahraptor. I - I just never thought it'd be soon.
T-Rex: Alright! Life itself is, what - like twenty bucks?
Narrator: LATER:

1957,so hey um OUCH,,"T-Rex: It's time for some plasticized new slang! Some plasticized -
Narrator: NEW SLANG FOR TEENS
Dromiceiomimus: You're using ""plasticized"" a bit unusually there, T-Rex. Is that part of your new slang?
T-Rex: YES. I figure, existing words are already familiar to everyone, so I'll just expand their semantics! Plasticized now means both ""irreproachably amazing"" AND ""past participle of 'plasticize'"". And it's for teens, because teens are the thin edge of the language wedge!
T-Rex: And when they pick up on it, the ""seniorettos"" will follow!
Utahraptor: ""Seniorettos""?
T-Rex: Non-teens. Older non-teens, actually. Younger non-teens are called ""babypants"", as they have been since time immemorial.
Utahraptor: Well, when you find some teens, be sure to let them know your new slang!
T-Rex (punchline): TOTALLY ON IT.

Take your current age and double it!
T-Rex: DO IT RIGHT NOW
T-Rex: Wow, that's a big number, huh?
T-Rex: Now imagine actually being that - I'll say it - OLD. Crazy, isn't it? The idea of living life at such an age, knowing each day that you're just getting older still. Imagine what your life would be like then, some of your friends gone, others changed almost beyond recognition. You don't keep in touch with them all anymore, obviously.
T-Rex: Well, anyway: good news! You're already half-way there!
Utahraptor: T-Rex, that's terrible! Now I feel super old and sad!
T-Rex: No worries!
T-Rex: Take your current age and sextuple it. The odds of you being dead at that point are, how do I put this, ""nontrivial"".
Utahraptor: That makes me feel worse!!
T-Rex: Okay, take your current age and divide it by six! Now you're a kid again!

T-Rex: Especially since it was destroyed by fire or maybe looting a few centuries later!
T-Rex: Oh, what knowledge we have lost! What revelations were written on those ancient papyrus scrolls, now entirely beyond our grasp? With this lost information, could the industrial revolution have arrived a thousand years earlier? The only answer I can offer is an enthusiastic ""perhaps!"" followed by a wide-eyed ""who knows??""
Utahraptor: Whoah, I think you're putting too much into this, T-Rex!
T-Rex: It was a pretty great library!
Utahraptor: Yeah, but you're treating the actual libraries (plural) as a symbol, which only confuses what actually happened historically. Certainly SOME ancient knowledge was lost, but I think it's disingenuous to suggest that its loss meant our development was set back thousands of years!
T-Rex: You're saying that by building up the legend, I do a disservice to the actual libraries? Well, I've got news for you, my friend!

T-Rex: Hello and welcome to Let's Make Another Food! Today we'll be making ""apple pie from scratch"".
T-Rex: If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe!
T-Rex: Carl Sagan said it, and we respect a man who has such a deep, fundamentalist understanding of ""from scratch""! So we'll be devoting our time to studying protouniversal dynamics in the hopes of creating a small, stable, personal universe in which apple trees might eventually be induced to grow.

T-Rex: ""If only,"" Sally said, ""if only I could find someone like Timmy, but less capricious. And perhaps with either more or less mammalian body hair, whichever one it is that I find most attractive. But as my fellow humans have not invented technologies to alter people's bodies and personalities to my specifications,"" she sighed, ""I am out of luck.""
Dromiceiomimus: Aww!
T-Rex: ""It seems unhappiness is to be my most reliable chaperone,"" she said, sighing again.
Utahraptor: Awwww!!
T-Rex: Then she realized: overpopulation! With over seven billion humans on her planet all at once and only so many ways to be, there had to be an approximation of Timmy out there with her preferred changes implemented. So she travelled the world to find him!
Utahraptor: And did she?
T-Rex: Nope!
T-Rex: It was a sorting problem with way too many results to go through. Instead she fell for someone else, which was fine. It was all fine. There were many people out there she could be happy with, and a lot of it came down to chance.

T-Rex: It's as if guys are so afraid of being called gay, they go for the most capital-w Woman they can find!
Utahraptor: That's absurd!

T-Rex: So it'd be told in a series of shorts: each short starts a little before everybody flies into a wall, and ends with everybody flying into a wall.
T-Rex: It would be SO GOOD! You start out small: regular people, a fat guy at a buffet, building up to a parking lot full of cars tumbling into the sky, the star quarterback kicking the ball and then he, and everybody else in the game, flying up after it.
Utahraptor: Your movie sounds awesome!
T-Rex: I know!
Utahraptor: But wouldn't it get a little repetitive?
T-Rex: No way! The viewers would know what's going on after the first few shorts, so you play off those expectations. Like, there's this shot of a really elaborate wedding, and the audience is all, ""Oh man, all those people are going to fly into a wall SO HARD!"".
Utahraptor: And?
T-Rex: And then we cut to years afterwards, when they're old and stooped, holding hands out on the porch, and THEN the Earth stops in its orbit and they fly off together into the sky!

T-Rex: These can be easily harvested from sexually-mature landfowl!
T-Rex: You will also need 1 cup of an organic, warm white fluid produced by and extracted from the mammary glands of a cow. This can be heated to reduce the number of viable pathogens contained within, and chilled to delay decay and decomposition. Also acquire 3 tablespoons of a water-in-oil emulsion of damaged phospholipid membranes and milk fat globules.

T-Rex: Dear audio diary! Is it terrible to say ""It occurs to me that if I had different friends, I wouldn't be wrong all the time""?
T-Rex (punchline): Because it totally occurs to me that if I had different friends, I wouldn't be wrong all the time!!

2267,"i thought that was just a cool new nickname that my friends were using for me, as in ""Let's play, Checkers!""",→ I wrote a book about Back to the Future! ←,"T-Rex: You and your eleven closest friends go camping. You wake up to discover the floor is lava! But there's rocks too, and they alternate back and forth in a checkerboard pattern!
Narrator: CHECKERS AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: And it turns out there's another team of campers just two hops away. You're trapped together, so you start moving towards each other. Maybe you can help each other escape!
T-Rex: But then every time - EVERY TIME - when you reach each other, someone decides ""screw working together!"" and instead STRAIGHT UP MURDERS A DUDE.
Utahraptor: They jump over you and kick you into the lava from mid-air!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: Eventually a camper makes it to the opposite side, at which point they get twice as fat and can now hop backwards. I don't know why. This continues until all campers from one side have been eliminated.
Utahraptor: Yes, it certainly is a crazy game!
T-Rex (punchline): ""GAME""??

1877,sometimes we get tired of playing two-player games against an unoccupied second controller is the thing,,"T-Rex: The royal ""we"" is used by monarchs, popes, and also by dinosaurs named T-Rex. THAT IS ME, BY THE WAY.
T-Rex: Or should I say... that is US??
T-Rex: We think this is great, Dromiceiomimus! All our opinions sound much more important, now that they come from a grammatical PLURALITY. It's just classier to say ""WE ate too much and had to go to bed early"" than ""I""! We did, by the way, Dromiceiomimus. We made some mistakes at dinnertime.
Dromiceiomimus: We understand, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Oh man, you're doing the ""we"" thing too? We mean, um, you babes are doing the ""we"" thing too?
Utahraptor: I think it just extends to pronouns: one of the several reasons you shouldn't call Dromiceiomimus ""you babes""!
T-Rex: You guys think so?
Utahraptor: Yeah, and ALSO, we guys are worried you're going to end up sounding patronizing, like you're talking to a dog. ""Aren't we just the cutest little puppy? Yes we are! Yes we are!""
T-Rex: We assure you we are not the cutest little puppy. We are the awesomest giant T-Rex; yes we are. Yes: we are.
Narrator: LATER: EVERYONE GETS TIRED OF T-REX'S ""WE"" AND DECIDES TO HANG OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE
T-Rex: A question for us! Do we miss having friends?
T-Rex (punchline): SOMETIMES we does, yes

Which period do you choose?
T-Rex: I choose the future!
T-Rex: Or at least, I did choose the future until I realized that things might not ACTUALLY be better down the road. If I lived 300 years from now, I could be living in a post apocalyptic time where most life has been obliterated by a catastrophic asteroid impact - an impact so large that enough dirt has been thrown into the sky to BLOCK OUT THE SUN, disrupting the entire food chain and causing mass extin-
T-Rex: Anyway, that's a possibility or whatever!!
Utahraptor: So the past is the only safe choice.
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: But then I thought, well, there's a lot we don't know about the past either. And I wouldn't want to choose a time where it turns out nobody could make poop jokes or they'd go to jail and also nobody thought to write any of this down, so the whole deal is lost to history!
Off panel: So - that leaves the present?
T-Rex: No, that leaves us with changing the question so we can live in any time period, real OR imagined. I choose the time when everyone's awesome knights!

Narrator: FALSE DOCUMENTS
Dromiceiomimus: That's not a false document, T-Rex! Shakespeare was a real guy, and dictionaries actually exist. It's more like if, I don't know, the Necronomicon was read by a Shakespeare CHARACTER.
T-Rex: Hah! Shakespeare's already QUITE the character, believe you me!!
T-Rex: ...He's sullen to me sometimes
Utahraptor: Except Shakespeare did most of his writing before dictionaries!
T-Rex: Oh man, really?
Utahraptor: Yep! The earliest English dictionaries we've got showed up AFTER he started writing plays: it's one of the reasons he's had such an effect on the language. He was around while the written form was crystallizing!
T-Rex: So I WAS TOTALLY partially right! That's EXCELLENT.

Dromiceiomimus: That's all you've got?
T-Rex: I'm in over my head, Dromiceiomimus! I've totally barely ever immigrated!

Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, but when it goes poorly, your gift is nothing but an INCREDIBLY AWKWARD BOXING DAY.
T-Rex: I'm doing it!!
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: So I got the link you emailed me, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Yes! Go on...!
Utahraptor: It's a dating profile for me, using a picture taken through my kitchen window. My hair colour is given as ""bald but kool"", my age as ""about my age, I'd say"", and my interests as ""spouses"" and ""ASCII art thumbs up"" and then the rest of my profile is this enormous ASCII art thumbs up.

They'll reflexively blink each time you tap them until they get wise to your game, at which point they'll suppress the reflex and the blinking will stop. But until then, THEIR EYELIDS ARE AT YOUR MERCY. YOU CONTROL SOMEONE ELSE'S EYELIDS WITH YOUR MEREST WHIM.
Dromiceiomimus: Neat, I guess!
T-Rex: Pretty neat I guess, yeah!
Utahraptor: So your secret is tap someone on the head and they'll blink? You must be fun at parties.
T-Rex: That's only part of it!
T-Rex: The other part is if they CONTINUE to blink after the first few taps, then that's one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

"
1225,"the premise of the new batman books? um, hello? it's that alfred and spider-man don't get along and we watch the sparks fly??",,"T-Rex: The problem with Superman, and Spider-Man, AND Batman, and pretty much every other superhero, is that their stories don't have ends. They're all stuck in the same productive age range, 20-30 years old, and it's easy to see why!
T-Rex: Companies don't want their most popular characters dying of old age!
T-Rex: But the result is that their stories don't have ENDS. We don't know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age, how Spider-Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks. I mean, we DO, because sometimes out-of-continuity stories explore this, but they're never for real - they don't count! Bats is always 30 again in the next story. It's like David fights Goliath, but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years, and you never see how it ends.
Utahraptor: You know, there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: Soaps have long-running narratives, but characters die all the time. The difference is soaps focus on PREMISE rather than individuals, so they're not killing a cash cow when someone dies. They just bring in someone new!
T-Rex: So Batman dies, and the book focuses on his butler Alfred working for Spider-Man instead!
[T-Rex imagines a dialog]
Imaginary Alfred: Sir, I am old and conservative. You can't expect me to ""loosen up"" overnight.
Imaginary Spider-Man: Alfred, I'm young and liberal! I don't like your ""rules""!!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I'm so manly that I crack open walnuts for old ladies with my pectoral muscles!
Dromiceiomimus: Oh yeah? I'M so manly that I manage my emotional output, plus I swim all the way up waterfalls!
T-Rex: We both understand we're using manliness as an archetype, and that your claims to manliness do not reflect upon your ideas of femininity, or of normative gender. In any case!
T-Rex: I'm so manly that I pound nails into the wall with my bare hands!
Utahraptor: Oh yeah?
Utahraptor: Well I'M so manly that I use my bare hands to pound them out from the other side!

766,"incorporate cannibalism ONLY WHEN FEASIBLE, everybody",,"T-Rex: Zombies! Everyone loves zombies. They are a window onto the Other! They let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling, as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic!
God: HEY T-REX CAN YOU SUMMARIZE THAT IN ONE SENTENCE FOR ME
T-Rex: T-Rex loves zombies!
T-Rex: I think what I love best about them is when they're used to represent mindless behaviour in our own society. For example, if instead of me, we saw a ZOMBIE DINOSAUR stomping on this house, then wow! Suddenly stomping on things is highlighted as maybe something we should think about more! Are we really acting that thoughtless when we stomp on things? Thanks for the eye opener, dinosaur zombies!
Utahraptor: I bet you like all your social commentary to incorporate endless hunger for the flesh of the living!
T-Rex: Yep!
T-Rex: When feasible, anyway. I ALSO really like it when zombies catch someone and tear them apart, and the person is all ""O no, zombies! My day is ruined!""
Utahraptor: PERSONALLY, I really like how when you wanted something zombies could show as ""bad"", you chose stomping on things.
T-Rex: Man, that's just because it was a convenient example! I am still ENTIRELY IN FAVOUR of stomping on things.

T-Rex: They sure do. We're going STRAIGHT TO THE TOP, baby! We'll see if the deadly Everest Eliminator exists or not. SOME claim he's a wacky murderer who pushes people off the peak when they're least expecting it! Others say that's stupid.
Utahraptor: That's not why we're going!

Utahraptor: Like other languages!
T-Rex: Aw man! Other languages already stole my idea?
Utahraptor: Long ago, actually! Ancient Greek had words for passionate love (eros), dispassionate love (philia), the love of family (storge), general affection (agape), and so on. Versions of these survive in modern Greek as well!
T-Rex: Aha, but still no sandwich love!
Narrator: EVERY DAY EACH OF US SAYS THE DUMBEST THING WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT DAY.

T-Rex: Because if you're doing time tourism, you're going to do it right!
T-Rex: Every trip would start with identities being inserted into official records: a twenty-year-old travelling to 1950 means going back to 1930 to insert birth records, and trips after that to establish education, work history, etc. It's tons of prep for one trip!
Dromiceiomimus: What about the time travellers breaking character?
T-Rex: Hah! PLEASE. They've been trained since birth!
T-Rex: Every candidate time traveller consents to their personal history being modified!
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Of course! Childhood is replaced with training for your time trip, and only those that pass get to go! The failed candidates get their original timeline restored, no harm no foul. And if you DO mess up in the past, overseers roll back your entire trip!
Utahraptor: I see. So time travel is foolproof?
T-Rex: Yep! The only reason we've never caught tourists from the future is that any we could catch never become time travellers in the first place!

T-Rex: However, I don't claim to be misogynist! It is a problem that the very tall face when confronted with the very tiny. Sometimes you step on them by accident!
Dromiceiomimus: But you step on them on purpose! You're stepping on that house on purpose! There's no accident.
T-Rex: I AM MERELY SHADING IT FROM THE SUN, and then my foot gets heavy and tired.
Utahraptor: Okay, but now you're stepping on one!
T-Rex: Yes! I am!
T-Rex: But it's not misogyny. I'm not stepping on her BECAUSE she's a woman. Her sex and gender are incidental to the whole event! That's all I'm trying to say.

T-Rex: Teens! Are you interested in slang?
T-Rex: Here is some handy slang for you, teens! ""Bad"" means ""good"". For example, ""that rock concert was BAD!"" Further, ""bogus"" means ""bad"", but these aren't transitive. Something that's bogus isn't good. ""Bodacious"" means ""good"", but these aren't symmetric either. A salad might be bodacious if it's exceptional, though.

Dromiceiomimus: I got that, yeah!
Utahraptor: Could it be you have a CRUSH on flappers, my friend?
T-Rex: It could well be, Utahraptor!
Utahraptor: And it doesn't concern you that you have a crush on an extinct social group just because of their sweet slang?
T-Rex: Nope! It gives me hope, because one day I could meet someone who actually talked like a flapper, and then we could get married!

T-Rex: I think I finally understand fashion!
Dromiceiomimus: These, um, aren't very deep insights, T-Rex.
T-Rex: Man, they are for me! I thought fashion was ridiculous because when things go out of style you're left with, I don't know, a cute little skirt you can't wear anymore. That happens, right? And it seemed wasteful and irrational, but now I get it: you no longer like the reaction OTHERS have to the skirt, and thus, it no longer represents YOU.
T-Rex: And I can totally use this knowledge to design my OWN clothes.
Utahraptor: Clothes that speak of identity?
T-Rex: Exactly! Pants that say ""I am a successful person!"" Shirts that say ""IN A FEW YEARS I'LL HAVE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN WHAT I DID TODAY"". Cufflinks that say ""Life is a precious gift (WHAT the HELL am i DOING)"".

And GUESS WHAT?
Utahraptor: Bridges are women in German and men in Spanish!
T-Rex: Exactly!! Isn't that insane??
T-Rex: The imaginary genders we assign to words colour our perception of them, apparently overloading them with all SORTS of sublimated sexual stereotypes! ""Dangerous""? ""Fragile""? Are all German women ready at any moment to shatter into a gorgeous explosion of beauty? Are Spanish men all action heroes with nothing left to lose??

I looked and looked and was convinced all the grocery stores were hiding it somewhere. But it was gone, and that one box of the cereal was all I ever had. I never stopped looking, however, and yesterday I found it - under a different name, but with all the same ingredients!
Utahraptor: And? How was it?
T-Rex: WAY too sweet, Utahraptor.
T-Rex: It wasn't to my taste at ALL. And the kicker is I remembered it as being even sweeter! I realized that my tastes had changed long ago - that I'd never again be able to enjoy that cereal I remembered so vividly. I'd been chasing a dream that had somehow become impossible when I wasn't looking.

T-Rex: This is because travel beats complacency if you do it right! When you're travelling as a backpacker, outside of the regular tourism industry, you're going off the beaten path AND doing a lot of new things all on your own. You meet new people and, since you're put in an environment where you're probably less comfortable than you usually are (both literally and figuratively), you're in a prime situation for self-discovery as well!
Utahraptor: So you'd rather do your own thing than go on a big tour with a travel agency?
T-Rex: Absolutely!
T-Rex: But - I mean, I know it's not entirely a positive thing. All tourism can change the areas it touches! My role as a backpacker COULD be seen as an advance scout for the larger tourism industry - and if I find something wonderful, odds are others will soon follow.

T-Rex: Guys, debt is nothing more than memory!
T-Rex: And a debt forgotten is a debt forgiven. So if you want to break out of an endless cycle of revenge -- which is really just an endless series of perceived debts -- you could do worse than bopping your enemies on the head SO HARD that it causes PERMANENT AMNESIA.
T-Rex: ...Or - or you could bop yourself, if it's your turn to do the revenging.
Utahraptor: Debt's not unique in this, though! Lots of things rely on memory.
T-Rex: Such as?
Utahraptor: Well, relationships are all about a shared history, right? If that's forgotten, all that's left is a stranger.
T-Rex: That's true. You can't really love OR hate someone without at least knowing enough about them to inspire that emotion in the first place! Huh.
T-Rex: So to really hate someone, I have to put in at least SOME effort into making the memory of why I hate them in the first place. That seems kinda - dickish!

T-Rex: Well - what about philosophy, for instance? We've had thousands of years to think about what it means to be alive, yet we're still no closer to an answer! Where's the progress when we're still grappling with the same questions as the ancients?
Utahraptor: You assume that there exists an answer to such cosmic questions!
T-Rex: I do!
Utahraptor: What about the whole idea of ""the only questions worth asking are those that can't be answered""?
T-Rex: Self-justification from philosophers who can't reach a conclusion, my friend! I want ANSWERS, not debate! I want a one sentence SUMMARY of LIFE.

Dromiceiomimus: That's not a robot, T-Rex! That's a standard bread machine.
T-Rex: He's a robot! He's a robot and he sits on the kitchen counter and when I press the ""Breadmatic, I would like some bread tonight"" button and then put the ingredients inside him, he turns them into bread. You know how he does it? Through ROBOTICS.
Utahraptor: He's not even anthropomorphic!
T-Rex: Robots don't have to be!!
T-Rex: Breadmatic is a box because that is ROBOTICALLY DETERMINED to be the optimal shape for bread production, okay?
Utahraptor: You bought him at the grocery store.
T-Rex: You live in a bland world of consumer electronics, Utahraptor. I live in a world of robot pals who bake me food!

1453,"here is where i admit to spending the entire time writing this comic with all my kid icarus theme song remixes and covers playing on loop! nicolas ferranti, yours is my favourite.",,"Narrator: THE MYTH OF ICARUS
T-Rex: Icarus and his dad were imprisoned on an island with water patrols, so they couldn't escape by boat. But they still wanted to escape anyway, so they made wings out of wax and feathers and flew away!
T-Rex: Pretty clever, boys!!
T-Rex: And while they were flying, his dad warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun, because the wax in his wings would melt and he'd fall to his death! Icarus said ""Frig, is this symbolic of how we mortals should not aspire to usurp the power of the Gods? Is this an allegory showing the limits and folly of earthly invention? Because we just invented heavier-than-air flight out of WAX and FEATHERS, Dad. I think maybe the Gods won't mind.""
T-Rex: And then Icarus flew straight up!
Utahraptor: As high as he could!
Utahraptor: And as saying that things get hotter the higher up you get is incredibly naive (how come mountain tops aren't sweltering?), Icarus was fine. Temperature actually DECREASES as you go up the troposphere, and there's no way Icarus could fly up to the thermosphere, where things DO get hot, because there's just not enough air.
T-Rex: So Icarus had a great time flying and when he finally landed his dad said ""Wow, I sure was wrong"", and they spent the rest of their lives flying just as close to the sun as their clever mechanical wings would take them.
T-Rex (punchline): Kids! The moral is never listen to your elders!!

T-Rex: But - there is hope. Small changes compound into large ones, and soon you will be encountering situations you don't recall.
T-Rex: If you're going to impress by making predictions about the immediate future, you should do so early on! They may become increasingly inaccurate.
Utahraptor: It can also be difficult to convince people that you've travelled from the future!
T-Rex: Quite so!
T-Rex: This is why (if you've gone back in your own life far enough) using words and knowledge that are far beyond your means can help impress upon people the truth of your story.

T-Rex: Proof: robots are clearly significantly cooler than talking horses!
T-Rex: Conclusion: my thesis statement is correct! Everyone loves robots and everyone is totally bored whenever they hear about horses with souls that talk about feelings. BORING feelings.
Dromiceiomimus: What? I bet you read just one fantasy book and it happened to have a boring horse that talked about feelings, T-Rex.
T-Rex: One was enough!!
Utahraptor: You do know the two genres are closely related, right?
T-Rex: They're actually not!
T-Rex: It is a common misconception that science fiction is just fantasy with a justification for the fantastic elements. What people forget is that science fiction rules and fantasy...

T-Rex: PROBABLY because it's really interesting?

T-Rex: And what are iambic pentameters? WHO KNOWS?? I looked 'em up and TURNS OUT, all it says is it's a phrase that means ""having five iambs"". TERRIFIC. Then I looked up ""iamb"" and it said they're a metrical foot, so that's, what, 30 centimetres?
T-Rex: Have we all learnt about sonnets yet?
T-Rex: Please say yes
Utahraptor: I think metrical means ""regarding meter"", not ""in metric"". Meter is a poem thing, right?
T-Rex: Then what's a foot??
Narrator: LATER:
Utahraptor: Okay, internet says feet are ""a metrical unit that generates a line of verse"". Maybe that's related?
T-Rex: MY internet said iambic comes from Iambe, the Greek goddess of verse. Because there's gods for that? But then it talked about accentual-syllabic verse?

T-Rex: Stress?!
Morris: oh gosh, yes, i didn't even think things could get so stressful, but then they did! like for example i'm worried about how i'm ever gonna make friends when i get older. when you're just a kid, you've got people in your classes to hang out with and the best part is, every year you've got new classes and that means a heck of a lot of new friends! but when you're an adult you've got a job instead of class, and people don't normally change jobs every year from what i've seen, so maybe i'm wrong but it seems like if your old friends move away and you're not friends with the folks at work, then it might be awful hard to make new friends!
T-Rex: Aww, Morris, that's nothing you have to worry about now!
Utahraptor: Yeah, you won't have to deal with that until you're way older!
Morris: but doesn't it worry you fellas to have problems waiting for you like that?
Morris: if i have a problem, my parents and role models always tell me that it's best to face it head on, rather than ignoring it and hoping it'll get better all on its own! because sometimes, that doesn't happen, and then you've got an even bigger problem to deal with! and that's just the worst

T-Rex: It's okay.
Narrator: ISLAND GIGANTISM COMICS
T-Rex: So what happens here is you've got a population that's isolated on an island, but you have plenty of food and no predators! So smaller animals like birds and rodents that normally had to stay tiny to avoid being eaten are free from that constraint, and so they can evolve to be enormous. Giant turtles! Giant cockroaches! Giant birds! The dodo started out as a pigeon.
Utahraptor: And now, all the dodos are dead!
T-Rex: And now, all the dodos are dead.
T-Rex: That's depressing, eh? It's the problem with island gigantism: as soon as we discover the island, we tend to either eat all the animals ourselves, or introduce new predators that find these trusting giants to be EASY PICKINS.
Utahraptor: Yep! It's too bad.

T-Rex: Mr Tusks, do you ever get depressed thinking about all the animals we've made extinct?

Dromiceiomimus: Hmm... that eliminates Deee-Lite's ""Groove Is In The Heart"", since they weren't invented like 200 years ago.
T-Rex: Yep, though that is a good song, as well as instructional as to the whereabouts of groove. No, it's the Westminster Chimes - the tune you hear on basically every clock that tolls the hour! If you own one or live within earshot of one, you hear it every 15 minutes and the full version each hour!
Utahraptor: That's not a real song though!
T-Rex: Utahraptor, that's SONG RACISM! It is too a real song.
T-Rex: And I'm sorry there's no ELECTRIC GUITARS in it, but when it was composed everyone was dealing with them not being invented yet. ""Let's just use church bells,"" they said. ""They weigh literal tons. That's the max bad-ass we can be in this era."" ALSO: it has lyrics.

But if I were big into applesauce (or big AGAINST applesauce) I'd be way more into answering the survey.

I may have just made this up. Anyway!
T-Rex: You believe you're totally fake!
T-Rex: You're just a sustained figment of everyone else's imagination. The only issue with THAT is how everyone is imagining the same dude at the same time so well.

T-Rex: Have all minds within the sound of my voice become COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY BLOWN??
T-Rex: So check it: the universe is suffused with tiny invisible particles that travel in equal intensity from all directions. So if you were alone in the universe, you'd be hit equally from all directions and nothing would happen. But if there's a planet in front of you, then any particles coming from its direction are going to hit it instead and not you! So you're no longer in balance, and particles coming from BEHIND you will push you towards the planet.
Utahraptor: And YOU'RE blocking a much smaller number of particles from hitting the planet, so it'll move a little towards you!
T-Rex: Yes!
Utahraptor: It's a fun theory, but if you're absorbing particles all the time, shouldn't you be gaining mass?

Utahraptor: Well, remember that everybody's got to die of something, and a lot of the reason these wizards are getting a chance is that we've beaten or imprisoned so many that would've otherwise killed you long ago. Heck, 1000 years ago you'd be way more likely to die from Too Many Chomps From A Tiger Wizard than anything else!
T-Rex (punchline): Utahraptor, that is very compelling! In fact I have nothing more to say on the matter except that I for one continue to fear all wizards.
T-Rex and off panel: AS SHOULD WE ALL
"
1701,"the sub-subtitle is ""WHERE ARE YOUR VAMPIRES NOW""",,"T-Rex: My new book is a collection of fairy tales.
T-Rex: A collection of SCIENCE FICTION fairy tales, that is!!
T-Rex: For example, Cinderella is exactly as it was before, only now Prince Charming has access to an advanced computer SO AMAZING that parts of it can exist only in hyperspace!
Dromiceiomimus: And he uses it to find his true love?
T-Rex: What? No, he doesn't know how to use it. I told you, the plot is exactly as it was before. This awesome stuff is all in the background!
T-Rex: And in Little Red Riding Hood, there's robot suits!
Utahraptor: Used to fight the wolf?
T-Rex: How old is Little Red Riding Hood, like, four? Six? She wouldn't know how to operate one. Besides, their interiors are scaled for adults. No, she proceeds as she normally does.
Utahraptor: These sound really bad.
T-Rex: Hello? Bad is the new totally totally sweet!
T-Rex: I call my tales, ""Stories To Make You Say 'Why Don't These Characters Just Use A Phaser, Man, There's Clearly A Phaser In The Background There'""
T-Rex (punchline): The subtitle is ""Look At It, I Think It's The Kind From Star Trek""!

695,later: CLEARLY reluctant double high fives,,"T-Rex: I've never had any problems with dating someone of a different religion, but I imagine under certain circumstances it could be a problem!
T-Rex: Much like... most things?
T-Rex: I guess if there was some religious beliefs that one person had and the other didn't, it could lead to tension, but relationships are about compromise, right? But if someone, say, adopts the actions of a religion as a compromise, but not the beliefs behind it, isn't that just going through the motions, which isn't really what most religions are about?
Utahraptor: I guess a lot of it depends on the faith of the people involved, T-Rex!
T-Rex: How so?
Utahraptor: Well, if you REALLY believe that by not sharing your religion, your partner is harming himself somehow (i.e., condemning himself to a sucky afterlife), then you'd want to help him out, right? I could see that leading to tension, since there's not much room for movement there unless one of you softens your views.
T-Rex: That's true! Luckily, as I say, this has never happened to me. Therefore, double high fives for conflict avoided??
Off panel: I'm not giving you double high fives, T-Rex.
T-Rex (punchline): Man! Don' leave me hangin'!!

714,haha yeah there's definitely a stereotypical male fantasy in panel three.  women!  there's no time for talking about feelings now!  we're doing SCIENCE!,,"T-Rex: I wonder what it's like to break up with somebody over the phone. There's one way to find out!
Narrator: IT WILL ALL END IN HEARTBREAK
Narrator: a comic
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, pretend that we're dating and talking on the phone, and I'll break up with you, okay?
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, actually that's something I'm not very clear on. Are we dating?
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! There's no time for talking about FEELINGS now. We're doing an experiment!
T-Rex: Man, nevermind!
Utahraptor: Hey, what's going on? Can I help?
T-Rex: YES! Yes, Utahraptor, pretend we're dating and I'll break up with you over the phone.
Utahraptor: Okay!
T-Rex: ""Hello? Hello? I'd like to break up with Utahraptor.""
Utahraptor: ""Sorry!! Wrong number!""
Narrator: NEXT TIME, ON DINOSAUR COMICS: SOME UNEXPECTED SUCCESS.

Off panel: T-Rex - I don't think it's working out.

548,and you thought there wouldn't be any actual programming advice in the comic.  for shame!,,"Narrator: T-REX IN: PROGRAMMING ADVICE
T-Rex: Are you having trouble programming your computer?
T-Rex: Let me give you a few pointers!
Dromiceiomimus: Ooh, ouch. Was that a bad pun?
T-Rex: It was an... indirect reference?
Dromiceiomimus: I suspect that these are all bad puns!
T-Rex: Don't worry - they're the least significant bit of my speech. Oh ho!
Narrator: JOKES EXPLAINED:
Utahraptor: Aren't pointers programming tools, T-Rex?
T-Rex: They are!
T-Rex: They allow one to reference the address of data, instead of the data itself. It's like how knowing someone's phone number lets you get in touch with them personally! Hence the delightful ""indirect reference"" pun.
Utahraptor: I too think these are pretty awful.
Narrator: CONCLUSION:
T-Rex (punchline): Everyone! Program harder!!

Narrator: a web card
T-Rex: Holy crap! How are you not acting like an adult already?!
T-Rex: You're [INSERT RECIPIENT'S AGE HERE]!!
T-Rex: Maybe it's no longer cute that you leave your dirty dishes piling up on the counter, huh? Maybe you're at an age where your friends should be able to expect a certain base level of stability from you in your relationships? Maybe there comes a time when you pay your bills before you spend the money on fun stuff?
T-Rex: Maybe, huh?
Dromiceiomimus: Doesn't that sound nice?
Utahraptor: Adults also don't get so wasted that they literally cannot remember what/who they did last night!
T-Rex: Also true!
T-Rex: Man - maybe acting like an adult would be nice for a change, recipient of this card!
Utahraptor: Maybe if you PRETEND to be an adult for long enough, you'll fool all of us, even yourself!
T-Rex and Utahraptor: It's worth a try!!
Narrator: UPDATE:
T-Rex: Hey, how come everyone keeps trying to email this card to themselves?!
T-Rex: MORE SPECIFICALLY:
T-Rex (punchline): How come everyone keeps trying to email this card to themselves eight hours in the past
"
1952,a public service,,"T-Rex: Let's say you're a dude who is having trouble with, to put it delicately, too much poo. And you think, ""I'm going to take some medicine and put this issue to bed!"" Excellent idea, rhetorical dude!!
T-Rex: PS: I was actually this rhetorical dude!
T-Rex: So I go to the pharmacy and get some fiber supplements because the side of the box says that they ""promote regularity"", which sounds good to me! But it turns out that fiber only makes things worse! IT TURNS OUT, fiber is actually the last thing you want to take when you have a too much poo problem already!
Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, fiber actually facilitates the number twos.
T-Rex: I KNOW THAT NOW!!
T-Rex: Why the heck are we using artful euphemisms on MEDICINE PACKAGING?
Utahraptor: Because - kids can read them? I guess?
T-Rex: Utahraptor, these are PILLS. These are meds you buy at a pharmacy. I made my problem WORSE when someone WHO WORKS IN MEDICINE couldn't bring themselves to say ""Okay. These make the poops come out"". ""Promotes regularity""? What the hell is that? ALL SORTS OF IRREGULARITY CAN HAPPEN DOWN THERE. I've seen it!
T-Rex (punchline): I have, in fact, seen far too much
"
1887,"um, when a true party dude hangs out with his library friends HE TURNS THE LIBRARY INTO A PARTY AND RETIRES AS ULTIMATE PARTY CHAMP",,"T-Rex: I am a dude who adapts himself to the people around him. If I'm with party dudes, I am more likely to want to party!
T-Rex: There's no shame in this, on account of how PARTYING IS AWESOME??
T-Rex: And when a party dude hangs out with his library friends, he quiets down and finds a book to read. So obviously the friends we choose influence what we do and who we become! And so OBVIOUSLY I want friends that are awesome, so that I can get, or at least emulate, some of their awesome qualities. I want friends who can improve who I am, as a person - and I believe I've pulled this off!
Utahraptor: Really? You think your friends are better than you?
T-Rex: Yes. Who doesn't?
T-Rex: Why would I want to hang out with chumps that are worse than me? That sounds terrible.
Utahraptor: But we're hanging out with you.
T-Rex: Sure! But you probably find something in me that's worthwhile!
T-Rex: Either that or you haven't realized that I'm just leeching all the awesomeness I can until you're nothing but a desiccated corpse, with all the awesomeness subsumed into ME.
T-Rex: Utahraptor!

1139,"people in the stories for men are always showing up to work late, saying ""sorry i'm late, mr. bossman! an explosion happened to me."" then mr. bossman explodes them out of the office!",,"Narrator: STORIES
Narrator: FOR MEN
T-Rex: Men! We like stories, right?
Multiple off-panel voices: Right!
T-Rex: But they have to be good stories. Stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys, and then some explosions happen to them!
Dromiceiomimus: You sure like explosions, huh?
T-Rex: In a good story, they function as punctuation marks. Hamlet says ""To be or not to be"", and the building behind him blows up. It is spectacular. The audience whispers, ""Yes. This is what Shakespeare meant.""
Utahraptor: So your story is Hamlet only with explosions instead of punctuation.
T-Rex: You say it like it's not fantastic!
Utahraptor: Do the characters even react to the explosions at all?
T-Rex: Sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them. Sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast. It depends on the scene, you know?
Narrator: THE ULTIMATE STORY FOR MEN
T-Rex: Hamlet sips some whiskey while punching a man in the nose! Ophelia says she's crazy for him and they go on a helicopter ride. A ghost appears, and when Hamlet high fives him he explodes! Then Denmark explodes.
T-Rex (punchline): Later, Ophelia's topless!

T-Rex: I built a statue of myself!
T-Rex: It's LARGER-THAN-LIFE and it looks just like me! Only BIGGER. What I'm trying to say Dromiceiomimus is that it's fantastic and you should come see it sometime soon.
Dromiceiomimus: I will! But wouldn't building an articulated robot version of yourself that you can climb inside and control have been closer to the best thing ever?
T-Rex: Well, MAYBE. But a statue is still awesome!
Utahraptor: Yeah man! You should've built a robot suit!
T-Rex: But - I built a whole statue! Overnight!!
T-Rex (punchline): Although upon closer inspection, I must concede that building a fully-functional T-Rex robot, overnight, would have been pretty darned choice.
Utahraptor: So now you're saying you regret your statue? Man! I'd like to know what your statue thinks about all this!

T-Rex: It was SO embarrassing! My fave crush was there and he saw everything! Just when I thought things couldn't get worse, God showed up, and he kicked us both out of the Garden... for good! I could have died!
T-Rex: Then, when we were outside, I suddenly knew shame for the first time... and my crush did too! I swear I never blushed so much in my entire life!

Dromiceiomimus: And yet, you're talking about talking about it, so do you want me to ask what the crazy thing was?
T-Rex: No thank you! It was too CRAZY.
Utahraptor: You know what? I bet it wasn't even very crazy!
Utahraptor: Was it very crazy?
T-Rex: My friend, it was so crazy it was OFF the HOOK.
Utahraptor: That's pretty crazy!

God: I THINK IT'S SUPPOSED TO IMPLY A CHILD'S LOSS AND NOT AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
T-Rex: OHHH
T-Rex: Anyway, point is, I can write a sadder story. OBSERVE: ""For sale: sucky baby, never loved"". Done and done!
Dromiceiomimus: Isn't that basically, like, the same flavour of sadness?
T-Rex: Now there's baby trafficking involved! How is that not sadder than previously-loved footwear at an unbeatably low price??
Utahraptor: Maybe get away from the ""for sale"" angle?
T-Rex: Not a problem!
T-Rex: ""One day everyone died, ohhhhh no"" Now that's OBJECTIVELY SADDER: everyone's dead, not just one baby!
Utahraptor: The baby one's sad because we meet two characters: the baby and the shoe selling parent. Your story doesn't have any characters in it, dude!

T-Rex: Not just cool temperature-wise, but cool in that it made me look good. Too good. But I had to look good, because my first case of the day was my ex-wife, Fran. Turns out she was bein' blackmailed. Couldn't say by who, but I had a pretty good idea of who it might be. The night was turning out to be a real night... to remember.
Utahraptor: T-Rex, enough! Is this story supposed to have a case of the sucks?
T-Rex: No! Of course not!
Utahraptor: You're kidding me, right? It's stereotypical, but it's like you're not really sure what the stereotypes are. It reads like a parody where they forgot to put in any jokes! Also, is it night or day in the story?

I want the high score, and I want the scoreboard to say ""TRX"" at the top, right above ""USA"" and ""ASS"".

He would sneak up behind you and whisper ""There are some ghosts who don't punch people in the neck."" and then the last thing you'd see before you were punched were the ghostly words written on his fists: ""I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GHOST"".

T-Rex: It's a world where everyone knows how they're going to die!
T-Rex: You can go in to a doctor and he takes a blood test, and then his machine spits out a piece of paper that says ""exploded"" or ""drowned"" or ""poisoned apple"" and that's it. No dates, no details! And so people who are to die from drowning spend the rest of their lives avoiding swimming pools, but they end up drowning anyway. Part of the fun would be seeing how!
Utahraptor: This story sounds pretty morbid, T-Rex!
T-Rex: Morbidly INTERESTING!
Utahraptor: True!
Utahraptor: I guess the only safe one would be if the paper said ""old age"".
T-Rex: Nope, cause then you could be killed by an old guy! This machine delights in ironically vague deaths.
Utahraptor: ""Natural causes""?
T-Rex: Hit on the head by a falling koala bear!

Utahraptor: Yep!
Utahraptor: You're a mass of bones and meat with needs and desires, of course that's affected who you are! If I wasn't bones and meat with needs and desires myself, I'd be SHOCKED the system even works!

T-Rex: The two are functionally equivalent?
T-Rex: And the game was, by walking around and trying to act normal, I had to figure out what was going on. It was the sort of game where you'd notice trees that had been cut down, touch your arm and mutter ""When did I start wearing a watch?"", and then talk to your mom and try to fake your way through a conversation about school without knowing years of history. It was fun!
Dromiceiomimus: Aww! You must have been such a cute kid!
Utahraptor: So why'd you stop?

A song that transcends personal taste and never gets old and is everyone's favourite, without exception. The best of all possible songs. What would the music world be like if there were no longer any chance of anyone else having a number one song - THE number one song? What if everyone was left fighting for second place?
Utahraptor: I actually think it would be fascinating!
T-Rex: Really?
Utahraptor: Yeah! It would be amazing seeing how some artists react, knowing that the best epitaph they could hope for was ""runner up"". I think you'd see a lot of esoteric music, exploring areas that aren't in the number one song!

T-Rex: It's true! You travel back in time to the 1200s and you say ""What colour goes with St. Patrick?"" and they'll answer ""blue""! Eventually. First you'll need to figure out how to communicate with the people there: their vowels will sound all crazy to your ears. Plus, assuming you're in an English speaking part of the world - and there were a lot fewer of them then - the language was way more Germanic than what you're used to.
T-Rex: You're right in the middle of Middle English, my friend!
Utahraptor: And it was really fragmented back then!
Utahraptor: The British will end up creating a Standard English just to ensure that government communication can be READ outside of London.
T-Rex: But not until the 1400s, so if you're in the 1200s and nobody understands you, you could always wander around, find another dialect group, and try again!
T-Rex (punchline): Anyway yeah now St. Patrick's colour is green

506,LET ME PERFORM THE JENDRASSIK MANEUVER ON YOU MY LOVE,,"T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for more SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!
T-Rex: Wooo!
T-Rex: Secrets!!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, you know how doctors will hit your knee with a hammer to test your reflexes?
Dromiceiomimus: Indeed I do!
T-Rex: WELL! In some cases the patient will be too aware of what's going on, and the test won't work. In such cases the patient is asked to lock their hands together and pull them in opposite directions. This distraction allows the test to succeed!
T-Rex: I believe this is called the ""Jendrassik Maneuver""!
Utahraptor: That's a pretty sinister name!
T-Rex: You're telling me! What's neat about it, though, is that it's AUTOMATIC. Even if you're aware that it's a distraction, the Maneuver still works!
Utahraptor: Really?
T-Rex: Yep! It's a neurological distraction affecting the pathways between the central nervous system and the motor neurons, dishibiting any tonic (i.e.: baseline) inhibition.
T-Rex (punchline): DOCTORS, huh?

T-Rex: It turns bad things into a value proposition!
T-Rex: I'm all for optimism and for comforting people, so it's not TERRIBLE, but I've always read the phrase as saying ""you're sad because you got a raw deal, but ACTUALLY things will be better in the future because of this event, so you're coming out on top!"" It seems very - capitalistic, I guess? Like I would want to be comforted by being told that, despite appearances, I'm actually a savvy businessman?
Utahraptor: I think the phrase is more to try to find sense to a senseless loss, T-Rex.
T-Rex: I guess.
T-Rex: And I get that it's meant to comfort, and I respect that! I just don't like how it implies I'm sad because of a bad deal. I'm sad for the loss, you know?
Utahraptor: What brought this on? Have you suffered any losses lately?
T-Rex: Just one...!

Utahraptor: I'm afraid you're making the #1 beginner's mistake in predicting the future, T-Rex!
T-Rex: What's that?
Utahraptor: Only extending existing technology forward. Why are we still shackled to the cell phone interface? It's a thought-activated process, so why do we have to dial? And if we're implanting stuff, why not put the same sensors by the mouth and ears and avoid the hands entirely? Plus, I mean, this way YOU could use the phone as well.

T-Rex: Maybe 100 years from now people will look back on us and say ""MAN I can't believe they permitted lifestyles different than my own, current lifestyle. Sheesh!""
Dromiceiomimus: Or maybe they'll look back and be aghast at all the animals we kill and eat for food?
T-Rex: Aw man, do you really think so? Frig, I'd be TOTALLY POOCHED. I've eaten so many friggin' animals!
Utahraptor: Most of us have though!
T-Rex: Yeah, but I'm totally the worst.
T-Rex: Future folks can munch on a carrot, look back on us and say ""They were wrong to eat so many tasty animals."" FINE. But then when they see the caliber, frequency and verve of MY animal consumption, they'll spit out their carrots in surprise!

Text: Tina Rex was a woman with a curse. Tina Rex was a woman with a very peculiar curse.
Text: Ever since she was six, Tina Rex knew that she was one day to wake up as a man!
Text: She had been given this curse by her stepmother, who hated her, and presumably men as well. The curse didn't scare Tina. Failing to meet monthly progress reports scared her, missing a checkpoint on her Five-Year Plan scared her, but being a man was like being a woman, she figured, only with more prostate exams. She smiled at her joke. Tina Rex woke up as a man on her 31st birthday.
Utahraptor: So! Did you read my rewrite of your comic?
T-Rex: IT WAS SO TERRIBLE
T-Rex: Okay, listen, you're not allowed to rewrite my stories anymore. Prostate exam jokes? Seriously? I stopped reading it three panels in.

T-Rex: Awesome inflation!
T-Rex: With awesome inflation, we acknowledge that ""awesome"" is now used to refer to merely above-average things, so ""let the okay times roll"" can now be expressed as ""let the awesome times roll"".
Dromiceiomimus: But I love okay times!
T-Rex: You'll love them even more now that they're awesome times!
Utahraptor: And what of actually awesome things?
T-Rex: As usual, adverbs solve all our problems!

But as I repeated myself to her I found myself unintentionally speaking both slowly AND loudly. I only did it for a little while, and as soon as I realized it I stopped, but I still felt ashamed. I was talking to her like she was dumb, just because of the accent! I was the stereotypical ignorant racist.

Only, the Americans are able to actually land their ship faster, so they're still the first ones to set foot on the moon. But the Soviet robot is still there, and its orbit has been adjusted downward, ever downward, so that now it's flying just above the Americans!

Utahraptor: But maybe they didn't move, T-Rex! Maybe they just DISAPPEARED!
T-Rex: Huh?
Utahraptor: They're a utopian society, right? But the term ""utopia"" is a neologistic pun in Greek! There, depending on how the word is pronounced (""eu"" or ""ou""), it means EITHER 'good place' OR 'no place'. In English the ""u"" handles both these sounds, so 'utopia' actually contains both these meanings!

Dromiceiomimus: What does that mean, ""story of my life""?
T-Rex: It means that that one incident is indicative of a larger trend in my life.
Utahraptor: What larger trend are you possibly talking about? The trend of theatres being full?
T-Rex: Yes!
T-Rex: But in a METAPHORICAL sense.
Utahraptor: A metaphorical sense. What metaphor would that be, exactly?

T-Rex: Easy!
T-Rex: For example, here's a tip! Maybe you could try understanding the topic at hand and expressing your views on it in a clear yet persuasive manner?
Dromiceiomimus: When I was in high school, I'd increase the font size on all my periods from 12 points to 14 points, thereby extending my paper in a way that was very difficult to detect!
T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! I am shocked!!
Utahraptor: Man, I just added ""very"" in front of my adjectives!
T-Rex: What? For reals?
Utahraptor: Of course! It was a great way to extend the length of my essay, AND it made my points more emphatic. ""Trees are tall and pretty"" became ""Trees are very tall and very very pretty. Verily!""
T-Rex: What, you were The Mighty Thor?
Utahraptor: Only in essays, my friend! Only in essays.
Narrator: LATER:
T-Rex: Hello, radio call in show? Did you know Utahraptor abused the word ""very"" in all his essays?

Utahraptor: So you're saying that when she was born, her parents, MR. AND MRS. NATRIX, named their new baby ""Dommi"".
T-Rex: Yes.
Utahraptor: And then, out of all the careers to end up in, she grew up to be Dommi ""the Dominatrix"" Natrix.

T-Rex: The first thing I thought was, ""Sure!""
T-Rex: But THEN I thought, well, wait, if I really want to fight homelessness, wouldn't this money be better spent on community programs that fight it, both through helping the homeless and through political change? But then I thought, well, this guy's right here, you know, and saying that I'm gonna make a donation isn't gonna cut it. And then I thought, wait, this guy looks pretty out of it - is he going to spend my money on drugs? Do I want to tacitly support addiction?
Utahraptor: And then you thought how prejudiced that was?
T-Rex: Sure did!
T-Rex: Then I thought, even if he is gonna spend it on drugs, is it my job to deny him money? Should I go around enforcing my morality on others? Then I thought, geez man, how ridiculous am I that a guy asking for change throws me into these throes of self-doubt and analysis?
Utahraptor: Pretty ridiculous?
T-Rex: Pretty ridiculous! But then I recalled Socrates' ""The unexamined life is not worth living"" and at that point, my head pretty much exploded.
Off panel: Did you give the guy anything?
T-Rex (punchline): I gave him my change and whispered ""DON'T TELL ANYONE UNTIL I CAN FIGURE US OUT""?

T-Rex: Our universe is almost certainly a simulation!
God: SHIIIIIIIIT
T-Rex: I know, right?
T-Rex: Because check it out: if you assume that computers will continue to get better, then it stands to reason that one day we'll be able to simulate an entire universe. And then there'll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones! And once you imagine this possibility, what are the odds that OUR universe is the one real one? It's much more likely that all creation is running in the background of some future dude's iPhone 3K!
Utahraptor: Seriously? You're seriously arguing this old idea.
T-Rex: I am, yes!
Utahraptor: But T-Rex, think of all the stories in which the characters are running around in a realistic universe, unaware that they're fictional! DUDE! It's overwhelmingly likely that WE'RE in a story right now!

1241,there are a lot of logistical problems with zombie ghosts that i concede i am unable to quickly resolve,,"T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for assuming that there's such a thing as a soul!
T-Rex: Assumption: assumed!
T-Rex: And given this assumption, and the assumption that people care about exploring the idea of a soul, we can easily cast ghosts and zombies as the investigation of the soul-having experience that they are. For what are ghosts, but souls without a body? And hey, what are zombies, but bodies without a soul?
T-Rex: In summary and in conclusion, ghosts and zombies allow us to explore the intricacies of soul (and body!) ownership.
Utahraptor: So why are both these ""explorations of the soul"" found in horror stories?
T-Rex: It's easy!
T-Rex: As people with bodies AND assumed souls, we find the idea of divorcing one from the other terrifying; therefore, the only way we can explore the consequences of these is through the lens of horror. Tada!
Utahraptor: Honestly, I think your theory is a little pat. It doesn't consider all possibilities!
Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX MEETS A ZOMBIE GHOST!

And then you're like, ""Welp, guess I'll make it possible to lose at sorting this deck of cards""!
Narrator: SOLITAIRE AS SHE IS PLAYED
T-Rex: So you put the cards into piles and move them around according to a bunch of rules that somebody else invented. And eventually you'll say ""Man, this game, what's the deal with this game, probably I should cheat at this game"". But you're playing all by yourself! Who are you cheating? Yourself? The game? Would it help if I told you that almost 20% of solitaire games are PROVABLY UNWINNABLE?
Utahraptor: No way it's that high!
T-Rex: Science confirms it!!
T-Rex: You're doomed to lose a non-trivial amount of the time, and it's not like it's going to happen in some super interesting way. The only novel way to lose is by dying in real life, but you only get to do that ONCE, and if you do, your last words are ""Oh look, a four of hearts. I can put that on the three of hearts.""

Dromiceiomimus: I don't get it, T-Rex. I mean, I get that ""here"" sounds like ""ear"", but -
T-Rex: - but that is just level one of pun! I'm also pointing to my ear and saying ""here"", so there's level two (a visual pun!) and level THREE is how ""here"" sounds like ""hear"" and you can use ears to hear things. I'll play it by ""hear"", i.e., by how I hear it! It is a PERFECT STORM of wordplay, Dromiceiomimus! They make movies out of perfect storms.

T-Rex: Worse than that. He was just so smug about everything! I wanted to buy some RAM, so that my computer could think harder about things? But he had this air of - disdain, I guess, that went far beyond ""aloof store clerk"" to ""terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive."" I bought the RAM but now I can barely even enjoy it.
Utahraptor: Well, you're done with him now!

T-Rex: Whatever! If I were in the future and I could open up a book and see ""The awesome terminal velocity skateboard didn't work, OH WELL"", then I would do that.
Dromiceiomimus: I don't think you would, T-Rex! Because you could basically do that today, if you wanted to read up on the physics. The issue is that even with the ground moving, the board is going to slide down the ramp because of gravity.
T-Rex: Ridiculous! There's friction in the wheels that -
Utahraptor: - wouldn't be enough!
Utahraptor: The treadmill speeds up to match the board's forward momentum, right? But if you've got impossibly perfect bearings, that's just going to make the wheels go faster while the board still slides down. So it's just the friction in the bearings that can keep you in place, and at the levels we're talking about, your wheels would melt first!

T-Rex: Delicious food is delicious, no matter how good or bad it is for me! Wouldn't it be so much better if how good a food tasted TO me depended on how good the food was FOR me? Chocolate would taste worse the more I gorge on it, until I stopped out of disgust. And if I haven't had any vitamin A in a while, carrots would taste like friggin' MANNA.
Utahraptor: But then every time you'd eat something, you have no idea how it'll taste!
T-Rex: Sure!

551,"thanks, etymology book i found!",,"Narrator: THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD ""WOMAN"" - IN COMIC FORM!
T-Rex: Many people believe ""woman"" is a sexist term, due to its apparent base in the word ""man""! This has led to crazy alternative spellings like ""womyn"" and even ""wimmen"".
T-Rex: However, this is not the case!
T-Rex: The word originally derives from the Old English ""wïfmann"", where ""wïf"" meant ""female"" and ""mann"" meant a person of either sex: thus, a female human!
Dromiceiomimus: Man didn't mean male?
T-Rex: Nope! It derives from the Latin ""humanus"" (earthling), from ""humus"" (earth, soil)!
Utahraptor: And while ""wïf"" meant female, ""wer"" meant male!
T-Rex: Exactly!
T-Rex: We can still see this today in words like ""werewolf"", which means, literally, a manwolf.
Utahraptor: So ""werewolf"" is actually a more sexist word than ""woman""!
T-Rex: According to me: yes!

T-Rex: NICE TRY, Dromiceiomimus!! My new passwords are variations on my awesome old ones, PLUS, by revealing them I give you more data points with which you can reconstruct my password choice preferences!
Utahraptor: Come on, give us at least a hint!
T-Rex: Okay. FINE.
T-Rex: It involves alphabetic Latinate graphemes AND glyphs from the European instantiation of the Hindu-Arabic numerational system.
Utahraptor: Are those -
T-Rex: Yeah. Yeah, those are the standard letters and numbers you're thinking of.
T-Rex: [thinks] Hah hah! Nobody knows my rad password is ""by storing this in your database you admit T-Rex is 1000% awesome and that you owe him $5000!! STORING THESE WORDS MARKS YOUR CONSENT; NO BACKSIES ALLOWED.""
T-Rex (punchline): [thinks] It's a long password but it's gonna pay off! In dollars!!

1335,"it's true, gentle reader! in a better world, you're looking forward to Casual Frigday",,"T-Rex: You know what? Maybe Leibniz is right and we're all doing pretty okay. Maybe this IS the best of all possible worlds!
T-Rex: Except for the fact that ice cream costs more than vegetables!
T-Rex: And except for the fact that WAY more people on the face of this planet care about the economy than they do about buying me presents.
Dromiceiomimus: And except for the fact that we can't just decide to stop making mistakes.
T-Rex: THAT, and except for the fact that entropy is always increasing and in the end all life in the Universe will be still, dead and frozen forever.
Utahraptor: But maybe in the best of ALL possible worlds, you don't exist!
T-Rex: Oh, wow. Maybe!
T-Rex: How depressing would it be to know you're part of the reason things aren't perfect? To look in on the best of all possible worlds and notice you're not there.
Utahraptor: Exactly! But maybe this is the best possible world for YOU, personally. Maybe this is as close to heaven as you'll ever get!
Narrator: THE BEST POSSIBLE WORLD:
T-Rex: I'm SO GLAD we named it Frigday instead of ""Friday""!
Off panel: We followed the Germanic roots of the goddess Frigg's name instead of the English ones!
T-Rex (punchline): Attention, naked and sexy (yet non-exploited!) members of the attractive sex! I KNOW

2079,"""THON SMASH GENDER-CENTRIC LANGUAGE"" WORK FOR BOTH THON (MAN) AND THON (WORD); THON APPROVES",,"T-Rex: There comes a time in each dinosaur's life when he or she must look him or herself in his or her mirror and -
T-Rex: - Excuse me for a moment.
T-Rex: English! What the HELL?
T-Rex: We need some gender-neutral pronouns, like, yesterday!
T-Rex: ""It"" is impersonal and rude, and don't even try to trot out ""they"" for me, English. Don't even. ""They"" is plural and has always been plural and I've got to believe in the entire history of English communication I'm not the first person to ever want to talk about someone without blabbing about gender identity! I could use ""s/he"" but that doesn't work orally, ""his/her"" is way cumbersome and ""one"" is so classy that only I ever get to use it!
Utahraptor: People have invented pronouns like ""hir"", ""phe"", ""zhe"", and ""thon""!
T-Rex: Hah! ""Thon"". THON ENJOY THIS.
T-Rex: BUT THON THINK INVENTED PRONOUNS ALWAYS SOUND STRANGE? THON STILL LOOK FOR SOLUTION TO SATISFY EVERYONE.
Utahraptor: Well if you don't like both the existing options AND the constructed ones, what's left?
T-Rex: THON NOT KNOW BUT THON KNOW IT WHEN THON SEE IT.
T-Rex: WAIT, THON DECIDE THAT ""THON"" ACTUALLY AWESOME WORD AND EVERYONE SHOULD USE IT!
T-Rex: OTHERS NOW SAY ""THERE COME A TIME WHEN THON MUST LOOK THONSELF IN MIRROR"".
T-Rex (punchline): THON AGREE! THON HAVE LOT OF INTROSPECTION TO DO. THON BELIEVE UNEXAMINED LIFE NOT WORTH LIVING!!

2053,"this was inspired by Henry Darger, look up Henry Darger to learn more about Henry Darger",,"T-Rex: You know those guys who are quiet and unassuming but when they die folks look in their house and find an AMAZING unpublished manuscript that nobody knew they were writing?
T-Rex: I would like to be one of those guys, please!
T-Rex: I would also like not to die, please!
T-Rex: All I REALLY want is someone to look through my stuff when I'm not around and find something that makes them say, ""Wow, T-Rex had such a rich inner life and incredibly powerful imagination; I guess he really WAS one of the greatest minds of this or - I'll say it - any other generation.""
Dromiceiomimus: What did you have in mind to leave behind to make people say this?
T-Rex: I dunno - neatly pressed shirts?
Utahraptor: Neatly pressed shirts. Really?
T-Rex: Incidentally, do you know how to press shirts?
Utahraptor: I do, yes, because I am an adult. Listen, if you ARE secretly working on a 15,145 page magnum opus or something, the whole point of this is you're never supposed to mention it! Otherwise we might suspect and the surprise is RUINED.
T-Rex: Suspect what? That I'm secretly a genius author? Allow me to be the first to say:
T-Rex (punchline): PROCEED

310,i feel compelled to mention that it's less cute if mammals make an equivalent card,,"T-Rex: Yesterday was a very special day for many people!
T-Rex: Yesterday was Mother's Day!
T-Rex: Did you give your mom some flowers for Mother's Day, Dromiceiomimus?
Dromiceiomimus: I had some delivered!
T-Rex: Excellent! And, attached to the flowers, a note?
Dromiceiomimus: You know it, baby!
Utahraptor: What about you, T-Rex? What did you do for YOUR mother?
T-Rex: Lots!
T-Rex: I got her some seeds (she likes to garden) and some chocolate (she likes chocolate) and a card I made with a drawing of me hatching from my egg!
Utahraptor: Aww! That's cute!
T-Rex: Yeah, but when you open it, it's actually a robot version of me, and I'm shooting red lasers from my eyes that spell out ""HAPPY MOTHERS DAY""!
T-Rex (punchline): (Mom said it was ""very creative""!)
